# Synchrona

[[Hugh|Finn]] casts Legends Lore to try to learn more about [[Synchrona]], the incense fills the room, and as we look around we thick clouds of incense move with a pattern, pulling apart and rotating on axes around each other, coming closer together until they meet. A light airy voice, calm and gentle, says -

"On this plane, there are places where the veil between the primal is paper thin. A child born in one of these places at a moment of perfect elemental synchronicity is [[Synchrona]], and within it lies a physical manifestation of the [[Prime Material]] and a potent power over the planes."

Rereading through the [[The Unnatural Naturality]], it confirms perfect synchronicity is very rare, and often only last for a few minutes: [[Plane of Fire]], [[Elemental Plane of Air]], [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], [[Elemental Plane of Water]].
