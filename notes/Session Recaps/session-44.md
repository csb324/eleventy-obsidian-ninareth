# Session 44: Finally Crying with Giary

We wake up, and [[Costi]]'s [[Boots of Endless Walking]] have walked away! With some brief investigation we find their tracks, back towards [[Jalantar]], at least a few hours old. Maybe we'll find them on the way?

While there, we also find another set of footprints, smaller and lighter (but still human), centered around the glade we slept in. A quick doodle of what appears to be two stick figures dancing is carved onto a nearby tree. [[Hugh]] takes a rubbing of it. With some closer investigation, it almost seems like the kind of drawing someone would do while bored... or doing something else. Keeping watch on [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] perhaps? Finding no other clues, we decide to head back towards town.

On the road, we discuss what we're going to tell [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], about [[Damien]].

Back in [[Jalantar]], [[Freya]] comes down with sessionitis. We decide to drop her, and our stuff, off at [[The Tiamat House|Vasks House]]. [[Rez]] and [[Costi]] leave a note on [[Vask]]'s pillow. [[Costi]] has a BRILLIANT idea, and swaps the lanterns kerosene into the hooka lamp. Just a small bomb. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] reports in to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] to schedule a meet-up through the listening stone. [[Henrik]] says they're in the apartments in the Western [[The Academy District]] in an hour. [[Hugh]] looks at the books left there. 

We head to meet up with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], he had a historian, Mr. Wurtherford Odlenstein, waiting for [[Freya]], but sent him away since she would not be here. Odlenstein left a card for her that we said we'd pass along. [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] filled [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] in with a somewhat redacted recounting of our interaction with [[Damien]], and gave him all the jewlery from his undead friends to settle his debt.  [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] said the debt seems paid, but he hopes to find him again in the future.

As payment  for our services, [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] gave us the jewelry from [[Damien]]. The [[Amulet of Blasting]], and a [[Lesser Ring of Protection]], and some assorted jelwery. We tell him about [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s attacks, and he tells us he'll provide us an alibi whenever we set our plan. We think we'll plan for dinner day after tomorrow. After that concludes, we should prepare to head to [[Arkhosia (City)]]. On the way out [[Henrik]] says he thinks the blue monster that attacked us is an Oni - a blue skinned ogre with affinity for the cold. Says we should consider working together, if proximity will keep us close throughout the [[Arkhosian Elections]]. 

Afterwards, we split up for some errands.

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] run around and enquire about daggers for an apology gift for [[Qik]]. After shopping, [[Costi]] goes to the [[The Fiddlers Respite]] to say he's sorry. [[Innis]] grills him over a bottle of whiskey. Relenting, she says if [[Costi]] makes her cry again she'll break his leg. 

[[Qik]] comes down, gives [[Costi]] the cold shoulder, bringing up a couple patrons and leaving him sitting there. After a few hours, she relents. [[Costi]] apologizes profousely, gives her flowers and shows her the design for the dagger. She decides to give him another chance. He asks her on another date before [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] has to leave town. [[Hugh]] tells her his middle name is Barnabus, which prompts her to only refer to him as Barny. He deserves it. 

[[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] randomly get stopped by a guard, who says he got a report of two women matching our description selling Dizzin to kids at [[Redscale]]. After some honestly concerning banter, the guard searches us and finds large bags of white powder in our belongings. On closer inspection, it turns out to be powdered sugar... [[Vask]] strikes again. Baffled and honestly a bit depressed, the guard decides it's better to let some things lie. 

At the [[Dragonsfire Forge]], [[Costi]] gets [[Divitston Goldstone]] to commission the dagger for 150 gp. It'll be ready by day after tomorrow. [[Hugh]] goes to the hearth, and offers the pretty leaf he found in the [[Liveth forest]]. 

[[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] go to the [[The Sheath and Sickle]]. Tease [[Giary]] some over the new gossip that from [[Winston]] that he used to run a floral themed bar named Petunia's, but very quickly spring some questions on him to see if he's hiding [[Niko]] there. It really doesn't seem like he knows where he is, but does share that he's been liasing with the [[Fire Raisers]]. We share their ask of us to find [[Niko]] and his friends. He's adamant he doesn't know, but also very insistent we all come back together. We say we'll all come back tonight.

We all met back up at the [[The Tiamat House]] and reviewed our day. [[Vask]] came back, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] immediately confronted him about the Dizzin prank, but leaned in and told him [[Rez]] was addicted to drugs. He goes up to his room, and promptly blows up himself up with his hookah.

Coming down, pissed OFF, he shoots [[Costi]] who is dressed like the actor [[Rez]] hired to pronounce him ill with a severe case of burns and oh, also the chlamydia. Incensed, he immediately confronted [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] about the love notes she'd be leaving him -- and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] rolled with the punches, telling him she didn't think he read the private notes out loud. He was SO. EMBARASSED. [[Rez]] and [[Costi]] were thrilled.

The whole group goes back to [[The Sheath and Sickle]] to catch up with [[Giary]]. He wants more information about what the [[Fire Raisers]] have asked us to. After a well-spoken plea by [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Giary]] says he doesn't know where [[Niko]] is but knows where some of the other folks hiding from the [[Fire Raisers]] are, and might help us get connected to them. 

For totally unrelated reasons, [[Giary]] leads us to the basement and "accidentally" drops a key. Turns out [[Srictha]] is waiting inside a hidden room! He says he knows things went wrong at the [[Bellisme Show]]. He was there, helping folks hide, disguising people (which he claims to be very good at). Says he was upset at how things went, saved some people with a few folks around him. He didn't like the energy in [[The Furnace]] afterwards, that everyone was being supicious and looking for someone to blame. His intutition told him to leave - so he did. He's been laying low ever sense, heard through some friends that the [[Fire Raisers]] were blaming him for the attack. 

Said things have been "off" for the last few weeks in the [[Fire Raisers]] before the [[Bellisme Show]]. There'd been a bunch of new recruits, but while most folks were excited, [[Cinder]] was acting frustrated. Didn't seem to like the orders he was being given. Understood the new folks were important people in the city, folks of signficance. Hasn't seen [[Niko]] since the attack, but he wouldn't be surprised if he was caught up in all of this - he's got a lot of anger. 

Told him we were worried about political intereference, trying to break up the [[Fire Raisers]] from the inside. [[Srictha]] thinks he saw a [[Dragon's Hide]] helm in [[Cinder]]'s office with [[Winifey]]. 

Said most of the [[Fire Raisers]] activity is going to [[Arkhosia (City)]], he was supposed to bring down a wagon with green and black uniforms with yellow trimming, 40-50 of them. [[Cinder]] wrote the [[From the Ashes Flyer]]. Asked us if there was a way to help him get to [[Arkhosia (City)]], that he still believes in the [[Fire Raisers]] mission - and wants to be sure it happens in the right way. 

Our group realizes maybe we should be even more intentional about how we "turn someone in" to [[Ricci Scrucks]], if he's maybe looking for the internally deisgnated fall-man by the [[Fire Raisers]]. That, or potentially [[Relakas]] made his way in.

We talked to [[Giary]] about the [[Dragon's Hide]]'s work for with the [[The Stagehands]], [[Costi]] gave him a hidesman patch, if it's useful. He's going to see what he can figure out. 

After some group re-capping, [[Rez]] sends to [[Winifey]], "Winifey!! It's Rez!! The Bellisime. It was BAD. You seemed surprised and mad too - we want who did it. Help us? 'But's tomorrow breakfast? Shhhhh"
	Her response - "It's great to hear from you, of course - let's talk. See you at But's"

We all go back to the house. [[Rez]] tries to check on [[Vask]] and cheer him up, but he's sulking. So instead she confirms with [[Magister]] when we're planning to blow up [[The Tiamat House]], he says the same day as the [[the Mayor of Jalantar]] celebrations. [[Costi]] does something secret. We all go to bed.
