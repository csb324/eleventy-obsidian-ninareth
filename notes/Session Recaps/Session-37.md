# Session 37: Stalking Threthdia Scrivit

[[Hugh]]'s potluck at the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] is tomorrow.

The gang remembered there's been some busy with Hags, and want to do some recon on [[Threthdia Scrivit]]. 

We got sidetracked talking about middle names. Learned [[Costi]] is officially Constantine Barnibus Grosu. They asked [[Rez]] who didn't have one. With some group suggestions, they settled on Rez Named Tanin. 

Freya derailed her naming convention to disucss her worries about sharing more about [[Polaris]] with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. She also wants to talk to [[Pik]] and [[Pak]] but laments [[Magister]] won't let her come to dinner. [[Rez]] said she'll ask [[Vask]]. 

Circling back on [[Threthdia Scrivit]], we decide to:
* first - go the library to find mentions of her, learn about hags, and ALSO look for plays
* second - go to her office, talk to her under the guise of checking in on her well-being after the [[Bellisme Show]]. Then bring up a play related to *hags* and have [[Costi]] read her mind while we talk about it
* third - go walk around her office and home and see if anything sticks out

At the library, [[Costi]], [[Hugh]], and [[Freya]] look for information on [[Threthdia Scrivit]] in [[The Talon]]. Costi does an exceptional job, and learns that she's mentioned almost every single edition. Tracing the Scrivit lineage, he sees a pattern in behavior - essentially every other Scrivit acts in a similiar way, donating to the same sorts of organization, favoring the same types of artists, etc. She has a proclivity for dark operas.

They also tried to research hags, but mostly find children's stories.

[[Rez]] went to talk to some students about suggestions on plays that involve monsters, like specifically hags. Pretending to be a student doing research on plays with monsters, and talking to some students got recommendations for plays on the fey: [[The Thrice Broken Trocaire]] which mentions the creation of a bagman Banderhobb (SOUNDS AWFULLY FAMILIAR) and [[Tastail Tine]]. She found and checked out copies of both. 

After the library, [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] went to scope out [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s house. One house has a large amount of sawdust, and seems like it might've just had rennovations or repairs from the [[Mysterious Explosions]]. [[Freya]] detects magic, and both the wall and gate have an abjuration magical aura. We try to do some recon on the inside of her house. Concerned the alarms will detect [[Samuel]], [[Freya]] speaks with a local bluejay (who is extremely suspicious), who says none of the animals go to that house and we shouldn't go either. Anyone who goes doesn't come back. [[Costi]] snipes that [[Samuel]] deserves to die, he comes back afterall - and takes psychic damage from seemingly nowhere, almost compelled to run along the blade. 

[[Hugh]] reminds [[Costi]] again that [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] had told him not to let anyone else touch the sword. Oops. 

We then head towards the [[Central Administrative Cluster]], there's a large guard presence out today, in response to the [[Bellisme Show]]. We're able to bypass them under note of [[Ricci Scrucks]] who has informed the [[Dragon's Hide]] we're helping with the investigation. Her assistant Vidlock pushes her last appointment and says she'll see us. 

In her office, she has playbills on the walls (the [[The Thrice Broken Trocaire]] is among them). She says [[Henrik]] escorted her out of the [[Bellisme Show]]. Seems more concerned about the theatre and the damage more than the people. She wondered why they may be targeting her and her friends, noted that she's a high-ranking political official. Rez offers that maybe they want to hit the arts and heart of the city to destabilize. [[Hugh]] asks if she can think of any other reason she'd be targeted - and is very insightful despite her being hard to read can sense her tension. 

[[Costi]] enters with detect magic cast, [[Hugh]] asks what plays she watst to put on and she claims it's a secret, but for the first time they plan to do a Scrictha original production (her great-great-grandfathers). When her great-great-grandfather is mentioned, Costi sees a dark haired satyr in [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s mind. [[Rez]] asked if the [[The Thrice Broken Trocaire]] is on the docket, and she says she never does a play twice, but that it's one of her favorites. She might've played the hag in her younger years. 

Asks if we could tell that we went to her house. We said we were there to find her, but she wasn't there. She invites us back to come look for clues on the investigation. She presses us to go now, we say we shouldn't without [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. She pushes for us to escort her home, we try to defer but she insists. 

On the walk home, she asks if [[Costi]] is seeing anyone and offers to set him up with a girl at the [[Redscale]]. Says she'll come to dinner whenenever we reschedule. Costi asks if her name is [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]]. [[Threthdia Scrivit]] becomes quite focused on if Costi knows what happened to her, and says she was a protege of hers. She referenced whatever band [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]] was attached to, and [[Costi]] helpfully supplies the name, [[The Miscasts]]. 

[[Loomis]] reminds us it's our last pre-paid night, recommends the Three-Headed Hydra as a cheaper but still good quality hotel. We chat through the day and plan to go talk to the [[Vrolbekk Pixies]] in the morning, once the shadows are fewer. We all go to bed in well lit rooms.

In the morning, we head to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] for [[Hugh]]'s potluck. The [[Praise District]] seems mostly normal, given the attack at the [[Bellisme Show]]. [[Carvin]], [[Noralin Brickview]], and [[Hernolig Alebringer]] are all busy at work helping set up. [[Divitston Goldstone]] brought friends Bordic and Hendra Rivenridge (twins). He talks about Carvin, as the person even WORSE at the metallurgy apprenticeship than him, and who made him feel more confident. The potluck ended up with a lot more turn out than they expected, and everyone liked the food. 

 [[Father Thronestone]] comes and asks to speak to [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]], asks if [[Rez]] still feels okay. Tells us he's in a tough spot - he bragged about the dragon scales, and one of his friends wanted it done too. Said he has dragon blood in his veins, and Thronestone grafted a significant number of blue and red scales onto his forearm. He's been acting strange since the procedure, and showed a black eye he gave him. Said he can't bring this to the elders, and would pay us in kind. 

His name is Burru Ilp, a human. A larger man, balding and in his late 30's. A tinkerer, who works at [[Gorva's Observatory]]. Said he can trace his lineage directly to Galaphanel. He has a couple of friends who also say the same thing. Thronestone gave him more scales, and Burru supplied some extra himself -- he thinks he might try to do this on others. Has a nice estate in the [[The Fallsides]].  

We agreed to go take care of it, and keep it a secret. 

On the way to [[The Fallsides]] to investigate [[Burru Ilp]], we discussed the veiled threat of [[Threthdia Scrivit]] to [[Costi]] to potentially go check-in on [[The Miscasts]]. [[Rez]] used the [[Circlet of Sending]] (Rip if [[The Beauties of Shadow]] are listening in) warned [[Lorian]] to be careful and watch out.
