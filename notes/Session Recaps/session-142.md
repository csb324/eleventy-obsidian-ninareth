# Session 142

Inside the [[Zhakastin Expedition]], we explored the first level. We fought the [[Shen|Un-baby]] *again* and found some hidden [[soul jar]]s. [[Rez]] knew about them and said her mom had known about them. What?

We also found a boatload of swords.

For detailed recap, see [[notes-142]]
