# Session 48: Sad Silent Party

[[Costi]] followed [[Hugh]] to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. 

[[Hugh]] set their holy symbol on the ledge above the hearth. They told [[TrueSilver]] they chose this path so they wouldn't have to [[Costi's Dad|watch any more friends die]], but maybe they weren't a suitable servant for her. Maybe they don't have a soul. Maybe the weight of their violent history is too much for Truesilver to redeem. [[Hugh]] didn't know, but if he was always going to fail he was willing to stop trying.

The hearth disagreed. It burned brighter, electric blue, and the quiet sound of harp music filled the room.

> Hugh: I'll never get to hear my favorite musician again.
> Costi: You're hearing her now

Comforted somewhat, [[Hugh]] curled himself around the fire. [[Costi]] sat with them, polishing his sword. And as he stared into the sword, he saw something. 

> A flash of an image -- an underground root system, deep under the earth with thick roots running across it. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp is in the corner, in excellent condition, and with a blue rose has sprouted from her throat. 

[[Costi]] told [[Hugh]] he thought there might be a way to bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back after all. He also said he thought he might break up with [[Qik]], or she might break up with him, and maybe he should do that today? [[Hugh]] put their holy symbol back on, and the two of them started moving towards [[The Tiamat House]]. 

## Meanwhile

[[Freya]] and [[Rez]] discussed [[The Curator]]. [[Freya]] told [[Rez]] she was going to talk to [[The Curator]] that night, and [[Rez]] said she'd try to stay awake for it. (Spoiler: she didn't).

When they got to [[The Tiamat House]], [[Vask]] and [[Henrik]] were both waiting for them outside. [[Vask]] told them that they'd heard from [[Victor]] what had happened, and asked for confirmation. [[Henrik]] had been sent by [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] to get a report. [[Freya]] didn't want to let him in at all -- [[Rez]] disagreed, and [[Freya]] eventually conceded that he could come in, as long as he didn't speak. 

[[Henrik]] was more chill about this than he has been about most things. He sat in the living room and waited. [[Freya]] went upstairs to punch furniture.

[[Rez]] talked to [[Vask]], and said something about getting in touch with their aunt. Who is this aunt? I don't know. 

[[Qik]] knocked on the door, hoping to talk to [[Costi]]. [[Rez]] invited her to join the "sad silent party" in the living room, where she could wait. 

## Reunited

[[Hugh]] and [[Costi]] arrived. [[Costi]] wanted to talk to [[Qik]] first. She had indeed come over to break up with him -- She said he's very sweet, but his life (what with the people dying and the disappearing for days on end in alternate planes of reality) was maybe too intense for her. Get out while you still can, girlie. But she thanked him for the dagger ([[Divitston Goldstone]] gave it to her at our award ceremony), and said she'd still like to be his date to the [[Adrienne Memorial House Demolition Concert Party]]. 

*Finally*, we agreed to speak with [[Henrik]], who was simply not going to leave until he had a report for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. [[Henrik]] asked whether [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s death was peaceful. We told him that it wasn't. ([[Freya]] still didn't want to tell him *shit* until we had talked about it as a group, but [[Rez]] started answering questions). [[Henrik]] told us what our alibi was, because the time-travel and the [[Threthdia Scrivit|dead-secretary]]-in-a-burning-house have complicated things. 

The official story is: We left the city a few days ago, on [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s airship. But this morning, a lot of people saw us walking through the streets with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s body, so we can't keep saying we were out of town. [[Henrik]] told us to give this some thought. 

[[Rez]], seeing [[Henrik]]'s unusual vibe, sent a final message to him before he left.

> I know I don't know you, and I might regret this - but if you're anything like [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], she didn't deserve what position she was in and maybe you don't either. So, for her, if you need help - I will help you
>
> - [[Rez]] *to* [[Henrik]]

Finally alone, we got a chance to talk. [[Freya]] admitted that she had a secret deal with a "friend" who might be able to help. [[Rez]] confessed her involvement as well. Obviously [[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] did not love this information, especially the part about [[Freya]] giving [[The Curator]] her blood. [[Freya]] and [[Rez]] didn't rat [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] out, but did admit that she knew about the desecrated mark on [[Freya]]'s back. [[Costi]] knew more than we did about what desecration means, and long story short, it's bad.

## Then, Julian arrived.

[[Henrik]] returned with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]]. We fleshed out a few more details of our alibi, including where specifically [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] had sent us on this airship -- to the mill of [[Tinza Ort]], a former associate. At the mill, we found [[Vigor Shade]], an *incredibly toxic* poison. Imagine if this had gotten into the city's flour supply! [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] encouraged us to bring this evidence to [[Ricci Scrucks]], both to give proof that we were out of the city, and to prompt him to investigate [[Tinza Ort]]'s mill. [[Henrik]] would make sure the investigators would find more poison. 

Killing two birds with one stone. How efficient.

The rest of the alibi came together quickly -- We were snuck back into the city for our own safety, then invited for dinner at [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s house. It was there that we discovered she was a hag, and she tried to kill us, presumably because she was jealous of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] and trying to get to him through [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. And she succeeded.

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] then reminded us that we are still on the hook to help him with election-related things for the next 32 days. For the most part, we accepted these terms, and [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] seemed pleasantly surprised. But [[Costi]] (really crushing it with his "fuck around and find out" era) couldn't let him leave without at least suggesting he might not follow [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s orders to the letter.

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] reminded us that he knows we broke into the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in|Zalevi embassy]], and if we didn't go with him to [[Arkhosia (City)]] it would be very easy for him to get us all on [[Arkhosia]]'s Most Wanted list. 

Then he dropped some new information. 

> You know it's the funniest thing, how easy it is to control someone with debt. A few years back I had the opportunity to purchase some debt belonging to [[Branton Spout]]. It's very overdue.
> 
> - [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]]

He pointed out that he could call in [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s father's debt at any time, and put her family out of their home. If we're definitely going to ruin *someone*'s life, it might as well be this [[Tinza Ort]] and not our dead friend's family, right? Shocking no one, [[Costi]] was unsatisfied, but [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] and [[Henrik]] left.

Finally, [[Victoria Several]] came in and told us to get our shit together. She needs this party not to be a disaster, and [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is a dangerous man, so we should watch our backs in general.
