# Session 93

We started by catching up on each other’s errands. 

[[Costi]] and [[Rez]] reported on their incredibly successful afternoon in the brambles. 

This of course led to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] disclosing that the last time she heard from her family, she was told to leave them alone, and she hadn’t seen any of them in thirteen years. It’s fine. It’s totally fine. 

Anyway, Adrienne told the group about [[Wyn Elreal]], who would be coming over soon. 

He told us SUCH a sad story, in which everyone he loved died in front of him, and a bastard named [[Von]] got away. The main necromancer (who was killed) was a halfling with a gold finger. (See [[notes-93]] for full recap) The info was sad and horrifying but potentially useful! 

He has stayed in [[Locations/Cities and Towns/Ru'Nileth|Ru'Nileth]] since then, but said he would help us put a stop to [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] in some capacity. Adrienne asked him to keep an ear out for her family, and he said he would.

in the morning [[Zmaj]] showed up and said “hey I investigated your family and I’m going to keep an eye out for them. Seems like they need it. By the way, your brother is in the army and might have been in the room yesterday.” 

Anyway, we left. And went to [[Quaath]]! [[Rez]] talked to one of the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]] guards who mentioned seeing [[Vask]] earlier but not letting him in. 

We found a hotel, the [[Marble Dome]], and got a table for the tasting menu. Before lunch, we got rooms, and they’re very nice. [[Costi]] tried all the flavors of water. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] took a bath. 

[[Magister]] and [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] met us at lunch (course 14: chicken foam). We caught up! [[Rez]] had to go to the bathroom and disappeared. 

Eventually we went to see what was up. [[Rez’s Sister Neti ]] has died. [[Zmaj]] had already gone to [[Durmask]] to see to things. [[Rez]] has been throwing stuff. 

[[Costi]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] left to get more wine and breakables.  [[Hugh]] made a little heart shaped pillow. ([[Freya]] was pooping sorry)

[[Vask]] showed up and announced he was going to the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]]. [[Rez]] went too (and got back before we noticed she was gone). apparently [[Vask]] has a tendency toward violence when he’s emotional. 

Vask pulled a gun on a priest and it worked super well. 

[[Gold scale Topaz]] is now some kind of code word? Important people  at the platinum sanctuary offer the Tanin siblings shelter whenever they want it? Not sure why!! But sister was “in pieces” which is of course, terrible. 

Lots of horrors this session!

Adrienne has had two different itching arms. 

Anyway we got drunk, and over the next few days we have talked about going shopping.
