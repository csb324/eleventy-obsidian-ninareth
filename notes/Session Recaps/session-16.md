# Session 16: finally making some progress on our to-do list

[[Rez]] went to work at the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] and seems to be very slightly improving at ironworking (plus, has [[Divitston Goldstone|the cleric]] invested in figuring out how the five cup swindle works)

We sold the gems (except the diamond) at [[The Ring Box]] and they were worth a LOT. we have some CASH now. The jeweler, [[Thano Daddelson]], was very skeptical of us at first but has been reassured that we will be very good customers. 

We went to the [[The Fiddlers Respite]] to give [[Innis]] the money we owed her from Tinzelven. There, we met some of her girls ([[Hugh]] briefly thought this was an orphanage). One of the girls, [[Qik]], had some fun flirting with a very awkward [[Costi]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked Innis if she had connections to [[The Stagehands]] and she said no. We mentioned we were going to meet Niko for dinner and invited Innis along.

Then we had to head across town. On the way, [[Rez]], [[Hugh]], and [[Costi]] stopped at the FIT to try to meet with [[Professor Vendorsmere]]. ([[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] popped her head in, and [[Becca]], the girl at the front desk, recognized her). The professor was actually able to see them right away, after hearing from [[Father Thronestone]] that they'd be coming. He looked at [[Costi's Sword]] and determined it had some unrealized magical potential, like it was missing something. He also gave costi a dagger to practice with. Good stuff. 

[[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] walked to [[the sheath and sickle]] and talked about animal parts freya might try growing. 

They met [[Giary]], who seems like a friendly dude! [[Niko]] arrived around the same time as team-FIT. 

We told Niko about the ambush at [[Seven Hooves]] and mentioned that [[Lish]] was dead, but others in his gang got away. This may be a problem for us. It turns out, [[Giary]] is in [[the stagehands]], so we looped Giary in too. (conventional wisdom among the stagehands seems to be that [[Lish]] was a hothead and had it coming. But still.)

We asked [[Giary]] if he knew anything about [[Costi's Dad]]. He said he could find out, for a price. We paid him from the group funds. We also asked whether [[Quarrin Witherspoon]] is trustworthy, and he said basically not to give Witherspoon a reason to fuck us over and we should be ok. 

Giary and innis have history. Business history. 

[[the Miscasts]] concert is tomorrow night, and Rez needed to pick up the tickets! So we went to [[The Needle Cushion]] and talked to their manager [[Jenson Davour]], who seemed truly defeated when he saw Rez. but, we have tickets! The boys were busy resting before the show, but we'll see them tomorrow 

Then we went back to our suite to hang out. ON THE WAY BACK, [[costi]] and [[niko]] had a VERY interesting conversation. Turns out, [[Costi]] bribed [[Divitston Goldstone]] to tell us to go to the [[Seven Hooves]], so he could give money to... that halfling? idk, someone. All of this was at [[Niko]]'s request.

Costi didn't think this had anything to do with [[Costi's Dad|his dad]], but [[Niko]] revealed [[the providers]] did have [[ELA]] connections and were working on it. Niko also said to keep that close to the chest, particularly from [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], who by his estimation is a little too close to the enemy. 

We gave [[Hugh]] the sex talk (including what a brothel is, and why people are sometimes secretive about sex). [[Giary]] and [[Rez]] hooked up. Those two are two peas in a pod.

[[Niko]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] also spent the night. Niko asked Adrienne if she was still loyal to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], or anyone. She said: no and no, but she understood how that sounded. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked what it would take for [[Niko]] to be open with us and he said it would take a disregard for our safety. so, something is AFOOT. 

Next morning: [[Freya]] checked back in with the [[wayfinders]]. [[Akros]] should either be back tomorrow or someone will go looking for him. She also met [[Veritude]], a friend of Eros's, who was grateful that she brought his things back. 

[[Freya]] also asked if she has places she needs to go and they said she just needs more stamps, so, the destinations themselves are not that important. Once she's a full Wayfinder, she'll have more straightforward assignments.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] forged a student visa for [[Rez]] -- she now has an ID naming her Nina Zaaraid.
