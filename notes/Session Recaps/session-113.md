# Session 113

- [[Colvia Ghul]] put us in temporary custody (a demi-plane)
	- [[Rez]] fell asleep immediately, and [[Freya]] drew a bunch of dicks on her.
	- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tried to find *any information whatsoever* about the things [[Willow]] had told her. Instead, she got a shit ton of incense.
	- [[Costi]] read a book and did a great job
	- [[Hugh|Finn]] did a divination spell to ask if [[Colvia Ghul]] had believed our story. 
- When we got out, it was *punishment time*.
	- [[Dispek Dradleston|Dradleston]] was executed for incompetence (RIP), and we saw [[Grishomec Teld]] use some sort of blood magic on his axe to finish the job.
		- Also, he was briefly reanimated. Fuck you and fuck your soul too, I guess.
	- The six of us were whipped, mostly to within an inch of our lives
	- [[Freya]] almost lost her shit. Someone unknown attempted to cast Hold Person on her, which Freya resisted, but luckily [[Hugh|Finn]] came in with a Calm Emotions spell.
	- [[Hugh|Finn]]'s emotions were not calm. He talked back to [[Grishomec Teld]], earning another beating. Please don't do that [[Hugh|Finn]]!
	- Then we learned the new plan. Because of our information, the [[Eberronian Seventh Brigade]] was able to set a trap. They expected the [[ELA]] to attack in one of two "weak" places in their camp
	- We were sent to go hang out with [[Fingers]] at one of the weak spots.
	- We were not allowed to heal from our very severe injuries! [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] sympathized. Apparently this is the sort of thing that happens to people in this army.
- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] (and a bewildered [[Costi]]) went to go meet with [[Colvia Ghul]]. 
	- [[Fingers]] warned us that [[Colvia Ghul]] is a "fake bitch" and not to trust her. Fair.
	- We also learned that [[Colvia Ghul]] is not actually in the [[Eberronian Seventh Brigade]]! She's a contractor, like us? Worth following up on.
	- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] told [[Colvia Ghul]] that we had omitted one thing when we gave our report, and explained that a *mystic* ([[Willow]]) has been following her and arriving in unexpected places for her entire life. That man was, against all odds, in [[Golstrava]] when they were kidnapped, and he and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] spoke about religious matters. He then left to manage a dispute between a lamb and a bird, because this dude is fully crazy and zero percent relevant to the war effort. 
	- [[Colvia Ghul]] seemed to probably believe it but she's definitely got her own agenda
- We spent a day in camp talking about who would kill [[Freya]] if such a thing were necessary. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] agreed that it might be. [[Hugh|Finn]] was pretty sure it wouldn't be.
- We were finally allowed to heal halfway
- Then the fire nation attacked
