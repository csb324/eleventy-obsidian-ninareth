# Session 7: party with providers
![](/assets/obsidian/comic%209.jpeg)

[[Freya]] talked to [[Niko]] to ask about the situation with the yaks. It turns out, some of [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]'s machines had gone on the fritz. Seems like a normal day in [[Tinzelven]], and unfortunately unrelated to *her* [[Mysterious Circles]].

We explained to [[Costi]] how to throw a shot behind your back..... He was great at it. 

We went to the party at the laborers hall! 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] told [[Victor]] she was a voter, which led to more questions she didn't want to engage with, so she went back to the bar. [[Costi]] talked to [[Victor]] at length, while [[Bliken Hammerov]] asked [[Hugh]] a lot of questions about what its like to be warforged. 

(Rez and Freya also had questions about Adrienne's voter status, which she answered: She isn't a landowner or fabulously wealthy, but her tax has been paid by someone else. Also, there's no such thing as a secret ballot in [[Arkhosia]], so one has to take that into account).

[[Rez]], [[Freya]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] played fantasy beer pong (The Journey? Travels? Something like that) with a fellow. Rez won, but it's customary to donate your winnings to the party when you're gambling at a political fundraiser. She did not want to do this, and is trying to get out of it by raising more money from other people and just keeping it.

Costi and Hugh met (and/or encountered) a bunch more Providers:
* Someone named [[Havarta]] whose middle name is gouda
* [[Gizzard]], a Kobold from Mulfara who's apprenticing under [[Bliken Hammerov]]
* A fiddling elf named [[Fendrian]]
* A drumming dwarf named [[Randlard]]
* [[Dwarful]] a purple dragonborn. Purple? Purple.
* [[Willa]], a halfling who is also some sort of healer

[[Victor]] wanted to introduce us to someone named [[Govspik]] but never got around to it. 

[[Costi]] asked how the arkhosian political system came to be, and got the answers. 
- It's been a democracy for about 800 years. Before that, it was an oligarchy
- Was it a violent revolution? The Official Story is: the oligarch ([[Eladian Forswyft]]) was made to see democracy was the best way to do things 
- Forswyft is hailed as the originator of the Arkhosian democracy (and founder of [[The Guardians]])
- About 7% of the population is eligible to vote

Adrienne talked to [[Niko]] to clear the air a bit, plus ask some questions about whatever [[Freya]] had asked about. He's also on his way to [[Jalantar]] it turns out.

We got the plan for the [[Gruung Attack on Tinzelven]] from [[Deeksta]]. Basically, we'd stay in the labor hall and they'd funnel the [[Gruung]] to us. Works for us, so we went to bed in the [[Laborers Hall]]. ([[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Freya]] first went back to [[The Thrusting Trumpet]] to get some blankets, and had a conversation about Freya's mysterious circles)

Some Zalevi soldiers arrived -- [[Doha]] and her twin? sister, and [[Captain Fretze]] who seems to be a friend of [[Deeksta]] and [[Victor]] but naturally, sometimes politics interferes. They were convinced to help with the [[Gruung Attack on Tinzelven]], mostly for sport it seems.

Meanwhile, [[Hugh]] saw [[Costi]] asleep in the back storeroom, and thought, hey, Costi should be with everyone else, for safety. So he picked up his sleeeeepy boy and brought him into the party. 

> "Hugh... why did you pick me up and bring me into the party while I'm sleeping?"

Costi was very embarrassed and pretty mad about it.

Finally, just before dawn, the [[Vrolbekk Pixies]] turned up! They woke [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to say there were *dozens of gruung* thirty minutes outside the town. They also had intel on the animals involved, and wanted to know where [[Innis]] had gone (sounds like Bel has a crush). So they're going to come to [[Jalantar]] as well
