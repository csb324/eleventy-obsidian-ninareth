# Session 47: Adrienne dies at the end

We made it to [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s garden, where she and the other [[The Beauties of Shadow|Beauties of shadow]] were waiting for us. [[Tobias]] was there as well, and he was *annoyingly charming.* There really was dinner for us, and it looked *really good*, but none of us ate any.

[[Threthdia Scrivit]] was ready to drop the pretense. We all knew why we were here. She called [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] thieves, confirming that her primary issue with us was that we had taken [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]]'s [[Circlet of Sending]] and [[Bag of Screams]]. She actually went on a pretty extended rant about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s uselessness

This was a brutal combat. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] did everything we could. [[Freya]] used all three [[Curator Quills|quills]] from [[The Curator]] -- the first, on her weapon; the second, on [[Threthdia Scrivit]]; and the third on *herself*, causing one arm to become imbued with some desecrated power. [[Rez]] was paralyzed, and briefly fell unconscious, but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] channeled some of [[Corellon Larethian]]'s energy to keep her alive. 

Eventually, [[Threthdia Scrivit]] locked [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] in her grasp, which turns out to be an incredibly dangerous place. Adrienne tried to get out, and tried to get [[Threthdia Scrivit|Threthdia]] to drop her, but she couldn't escape. [[Threthdia Scrivit|Threthdia]] crushed her to the point of unconscousness, then ripped open her throat. [[Adrienne Spout]] was dead.

> You don't know me at all, grandmother.
>
> *- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s last words*

[[Threthdia Scrivit]] turned her attention to [[Rez]]. But before she could suffer a similar fate, [[Freya]] unleashed attack after attack -- [[Costi]] had cast haste, giving Freya supernatural speed -- and killed [[Threthdia Scrivit|Threthdia]]. 

## An attempt was made

Chasing the final hag into the gazebo, [[Freya]] was attacked by small rogues (who frankly didn't stand a chance). But she noticed a window in the gazebo open up into some sort of portal back to the material plane. 

[[Hugh]] was gathering the rest of the party around [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s body, to try to revive her -- the first time he's cast this spell. But we saw our opportunity to get out of [[the Feywild]] and we took it. There was no time to search the hags' bodies.

Back in [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s regular ([[Material Plane]]) garden, [[Hugh]] performed the ritual to bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back to life. He seemed shaky. [[Rez]] gave [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] a riddle. [[Costi]] reminded her that they both wanted to make [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] pay, and they could only do that if she was alive. [[Hugh]] spread the fine diamond dust over her throat, where [[Threthdia Scrivit|Threthdia]] had made her final strike, and the dust started to glow... but faded.

> - [[Rez]]'s riddle to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]

Seeing that the ritual didn't seem to be working, [[Freya]] made a last attempt to beg [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to return. Some of the ink from [[The Curator]]'s quills was drawn out, into a cold silver light, re-illuminating the diamonds for a moment. But [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] didn't wake up. 

## The aftermath

Everyone was kind of stunned. But we realized that the sun was rising (weird), and the house was on fire. So we needed to leave.

[[Hugh]] draped a scarf over [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s neck and carried her across the city, to [[Corellon's Grove]]. We realized that time had become distorted in [[the Feywild]], and it was actually the day of the [[the Mayor of Jalantar]]'s award ceremony for everyone who helped fight the [[Bellisme Show|creatures at the Bellisime]].

[[Rez]] used the [[Circlet of Sending]] to tell [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was dead, and demand he help bring her back. He said they could talk about it later. 

At [[Corellon's Grove]], we asked [[Dawenys]] more questions she couldn't answer ([[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] would be proud). [[Dawenys]] said we could leave [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s body there until we figured out what to do next, but she really couldn't help with much else. [[Rez]] asked her to *find someone who can do literally anything*, like maybe talk to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. So [[Dawenys]] went to find a cleric of [[Pelor]], a more established temple in the city.

When she was gone, we spiraled. [[Freya]] insisted that we would bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back, no matter the cost, because that is what people do for each other. [[Rez]], having second thoughts about contacting [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], expressed concern about involving [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] in further debts. [[Hugh]] felt personally responsible for the ritual failing. [[Costi]] told [[Hugh]] we needed to stick together.

[[Dawenys]] returned with the cleric, and [[The Unforged Few|The Unforged]] got to ask [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] five questions.

## The final conversation 

**Do you want to come back? We miss you.** 
I think I tried. But it's not bad here. I'll miss you.

**If we can find a way, using [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] or our other friend ([[The Curator]]), with no debts, would you come back?** 
Shit, if it's easy. I assume it's not though. "No debts" is rarely *actually* no debts.

**If you've found your freedom, and don't want to come back, is there anything you want from us?** 
I should thank you... You're the only people I would need to tell. 

**Are you happy there?**
Yeah. I mean, I don't think I'm supposed to be dead. But, don't worry too much about it.

**Is there anything you wanted to get done, that we could do for you?**
There's a harp I wanted to bring back to Quaath. I promised them I would. I don't want them to think I just took it.

As our ability to speak with her faded, she had one last thing to say.
	Thank you for trying to bring me back. The four of you meant a lot to me. [...] And tell [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] to eat shit


That was where we ended. We sent notes to [[Victor]] and [[Qik]] (Costi was supposed to have a date yesterday, pre-[[the Feywild|feywild]]-time-distortion), and split up for a moment to process things.
