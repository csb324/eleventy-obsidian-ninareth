# Session 11: Zephra in Jalantar

We entered into [[Jalantar]] (through [[The Maw]] to [[The Promenade]] which is very stressful btw) and went more or less directly to  [[The Gilded Instrument]], where [[Raven]] welcomed adrienne warmly. Having a look at adrienne's harp, she pulled in a half-elf half-tiefling from the back room -- an absolute badass named [[Zephyra]].

Zephra said she could fix the harp for 3000 gold, *or* our group's help with a favor. After some negotiation, Adrienne agreed to pay costi and hugh 50 gold, and forgive rez's debt -- and [[Zephyra]] threw in some backstage passes for [[Rez]]'s [[The Miscasts|concert]].

**The situation**
> [[Zephyra]] used to run with a gang called [[Arazoak]] back in [[Zalev City]]. They pulled off a major jewel heist, but her place was raided and the plans were discovered, so she had to hit the road, fast. She changed her name and wound up here in Jalantar. Except recently she spotted a few folks from her old gang dressed up as [[Redscale]] students in the marketplace, and that's troubling. She wanted our help thwarting their plan, or making them leave the city.

We went to [[Fridian's Favor]], a slightly off-campus tavern / student hang, thinking Rosco and Drenden might have come in if they were posing as students. The bartender remembered them, *but* Zephra noticed a secret criminal signal -- this bar is a safe haven for their type. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] had already given the bartender some of our names, so, uh, problems. 

[[Costi]] cast detect thoughts and also got the impression that the bartender knew rosco but didn't necessarily like him. 

(also, [[Freya]] gave [[Hugh]] a lute lesson in one of the practice rooms and he's a natural)

Eventually the bartender came over, and he and zephra arranged a meeting in the back alley, in theives cant. We had excellent backup for the meeting -- [[Costi]] *pretended* to be a drunk sleepy child, [[Hugh]] carried him (pretending to be a bodyguard), costi could see through [[Samuel]]'s eyes what was going on, [[Freya]] just straight up hid really well, and [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] came to back [[Zephyra]] up. 

Turns out [[Zephyra]] didn't need backing up -- [[Lish|the bartender]] had been harboring her old friends, but they were a pain in the ass and he was willing to be bought out. She took a *big* jewel out of her bag, and he happily accepted that as payment. So uh, yeah, she has the jewels. Bartender let us know the guys were in the cellar.

Team Quiet ([[Zephyra]] and [[Rez]]) snuck down into the cellar, while team loud (the rest of us) stayed upstairs waiting for the signal. We got a LOT of info from [[Rosco]], [[Drenden]], and [[Kara]] before they knew we were down there. [[Zephyra]] stole their paperwork, which ended up being the giveaway that they weren't alone. 

The paperwork was:
- lists of names
- One of the names is [[Sarker]]
- Names have  letters next to them -- some with "F" and some with "T"  #mysteries 
- Sarker has a T fwiw
- Maps and diagrams of the [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar]]

Combat ensued. (They had black puddings and a bone naga??? bad shit!!)

The three humanoids got away, through a tunnel in the back wall. After a couple seconds to catch our breath, [[Zephyra]] DASHED through the tunnel to follow them. We tried to keep up, but rogues are *fast*. By the time we got out, the only one who'd seen what happened was [[Samuel]]. [[Freya]] noticed footprints -- bloody ones, headed toward the market, that turn into hoofprints, and one set headed the opposite direction. We decided to follow the opposite direction footprints, which we suspect are [[Kara]], the assassin (or, more likely actually, [[Drenden]] who was uninjured).

[[Zephyra]] left the stolen papers behind for us, but she is nowhere to be found. fuck!
