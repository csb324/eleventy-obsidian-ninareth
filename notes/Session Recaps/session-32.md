# Session 32: Julian has arrived

The next morning, we got up and talked a little bit about [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]]. [[Freya]] told us what she'd noticed from [[Terrav]], that he seemed to be smoothing some things over for [[Costi]]'s sake. [[Hugh]] seemed troubled by the possibility that he might remember something that didn't really happen.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] let the group know that she had reached out to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], whom she knows is in town. Better to be seen to be proactive than wait for him to stumble across us. But this led to a whole conversation about [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], and what his deal is.

And not a moment too soon! As we were all leaving to do our various morning errands (it is still important to be seen to continue our routines, given that [[Operation Incriminating Letters|we had nothing to do with yesterday's arrests]]), [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] felt a hand on her shoulder. [[Henrik]] came out of the shadows and brought her to a private dining room, where [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] has set up for the time being. They had a discussion, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] went on her way, delivering some letters he had asked her to deliver before noon.

At around the same time, the rest of the party was invited to lunch.

[[Rez]] still had the [[Circlet of Sending]], so she sent a quick message to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to let her know that they would be dining with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s advice was to *be cool* but not *too* cool -- it's better if he underestimates you. 

Before lunch, errands: 
* [[Costi]] and [[Freya]] went to the [[Burbank FIT]], where [[Freya]] just lifted miscellaneous objects and did a great job. 
* [[Hugh]] brought [[Maurice]] to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]], to introduce him to the growing community of [[TrueSilver]] at the hearth. 
* [[Rez]] brought [[Divitston Goldstone]] a present, and they talked about forming a detective agency. [[Father Thronestone]] asked to see [[Rez]], to ask about the silver that he welded into her face. He seemed worried about side effects, but she said it was fine.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], meanwhile, was trying to deliver these letters as fast as humanly possible. She tried bribing the carriage driver (whom [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] had provided) to go faster, and he seemed to in fact slow down, until an axle broke. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], who did not have time for this, tried to hitchhike a ride on a different carriage, but didn't realize until it was too late that she was going the wrong direction. Finally, making it to [[The Fallsides]], she went to [[The Fiddlers Respite]]. [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] was there, in a state of some undress. She promised she'd owe him a favor, but she needed his help delivering the remaining letters so she could get back to her friends. [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] agreed, because [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] is a straight shooter goddamn it, and he's not going to let good people get hurt.

Lunch with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] went well, as far as these things go. He seemed to know a lot about everyone -- he knew [[Freya]] was from [[Polaris]], he knew [[Costi]] went to [[AVAD]], he knew we had been to [[Tinzelven]], he knew [[Niko]] and [[Victor]] and a bunch of other people. This guy does his homework. 

And he seemed to be trying to impress us. He made a number of generous offers -- he said he'd connect [[Freya]] with a historian he knew, if she wanted to put some information about [[Polaris]] on the record. He offered his home (or, one of his homes) for us to stay in once we leave [[The Golden Gryffon]]. And he let us know that we're his cosponsors for the [[Bellisme Show]], so we'll be invited to join him in the Circler's Lounge. How *generous* of him.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] got back just after things wrapped up. She went back to the room, where [[Henrik]] had delivered her *entire wardrobe*. Thanks, [[Henrik]]. 

He also delivered a listening stone, which [[Freya]] noticed with some firbolg magic-detecting. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] recognized it immediately; these things are all over [[Runehorn Manor]]. She let the group know not to say too much within 30 feet of it -- lest you *bother anyone* with your *chatter*. 

Finally, [[Rez]] invited [[Costi]] to help her with a prank for [[Vask]]. [[Costi]], having proven he's pretty good at recreating [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s handwriting, agreed to help forge some love notes between her and [[Vask]].
