# Session 55

Bandits! 

We talked about it for a while. Ended hp avoiding the main bandit group on the road and quickly handling the smaller group back at their camp. Eventually this meant killing them but it took us a while to get there. Costi searched the camp expertly and found a very cool cube. 

Then we got to a small farming town just outside the city, where a farmer was looking for help. He recognized freya's wayfinder gear and offered us 150 gold (?) to go into a nearby cave and kill some awful giant spider things, plus extra if we figured out where they were coming from.  He pointed us in the direction of a local young man who had recently been in those caves searching for another entrance to the mines of the city.
