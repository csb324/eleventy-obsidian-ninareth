# Session 45: Butts.

Overnight, [[Freya]] had a visit from [[The Curator]]. She's here to help! She's offered [[Freya]] some [[Curator Quills|spooky vials]]. She accepted the vials. What do they do? Pretty much anything, potentially. They allow [[The Curator]] to pierce the veil, and that can manifest in a number of interesting ways. 

Was this a favor offered without strings attached? Sorta. [[The Curator]] did have a favor to ask in return. She wanted three vials of [[Freya]]'s blood, for one of her other "items". What do they want with [[Freya]]'s blood? We don't know! 

In the morning, we chatted with [[The Silver Halves]]. [[Magister]] wanted to talk to [[Costi]] about [[dunamancy]]. He knows a lot about it! We mentioned to Magister that [[Costi]] found the spell in the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]], which [[Magister]] was interested in. 

For second breakfast, we went to [[But's]], a butt-themed diner. There, we met a guard... who turned out to be [[Winifey]]. She gave us some insights on the [[Fire Raiser Baddie Audit]]:
- She thinks [[Niko]] may well have been behind the attack
- She seems a bit hesitant to tell us everything.
- She thought Cinder seemed... off? 

She also gave us a [[Fire Raiser Mystery Cylinder]], so we can turn it in to [[Ricci Scrucks]]. Finally, she asked us to swing by the [[Ruins of Fort Chyvensti]], where she thinks [[Ulia Glorsbade]] might be hiding out. We said we'd see if we could. 


### Fey Friends to the Rescue
We all head to the [[The Fiddlers Respite]]. [[Pendra]] greets [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] and goes to get [[Innis]] (and MAYBE [[Qik]] to [[Costi]]'s chagrin). [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Klida]] gives us the update, but [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] isn't messing around. Asks when we're going to free their sibling. We say once we're no longer in danger. We give them update on our fey enemies. He says they're probably always watching us, and are known for keeping grudges. They've never heard of the [[The Beauties of Shadow]], says covens are extremely dangeous and magically powerful. Warns us to stay away. [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] says they're stronger when they're together, that if we kill one they're all weaker. Also recognized the mushrooms we found in the [[Vrolbekk Forest]], called a Crusher. Said they grow with the attention of mortals, until you are trapped and crushed. [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Klida]] says she'll come to [[Arkhosia (City)]] to search for her sister and let us know if she's there. We suggest [[Srictha]] - she immediately leaves to go get him. We also stop by to see [[Qik]]. 

### Errands pt. 2
We all break for errands. [[Rez]] sells some party junk and then buys a healing potion, scroll of counterspell, and a [[Concoction of Conflagration]]. [[Costi]] picks up his dagger. [[Hugh]] sold some frog parts. [[Freya]] went to the tanner and commissioned his cloak. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] went to do some logistics planning with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]].  He's taking an airship to [[Arkhosia (City)]] but tells us to find our own way. He's also setting up a meeting with [[Sienna Burbank]] for [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tomorrow. [[Freya]] asks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] if [[Rez]]'s [[Shadowfell Shard]] feels desecrated like the mark on her back -- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] says it's cold and sad but different, not desecrated. 

We all return home for some pre-planning before our dinner of death.
