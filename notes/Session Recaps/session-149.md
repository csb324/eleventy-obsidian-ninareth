# Session 149

The Unforged Few had some stressful conversations. 

With [[Colvia Ghul]], we revealed a decent amount of information about the [[Freya's Mysterious Letter|Mysterious Circles]]. Not everything. But a lot. Leaving, [[Hugh|Finn]] noticed an interesting gold pattern on her skin.

Then, with Chamberlain [[Jehneim Bastienev]], we gave a broad recap of everything that happened at the [[Zhakastin Expedition]]. We are on brand: a confusing blend of powerful and inept. They told us about a potential upcoming job -- [[ELA]] wants to release some terrible creatures that are locked up in the catacombs underneath the [[Stormwall district]]. 

At our new home, a formerly-ELA house in the [[Commerce district]], we spent some time unlocking the secrets of [[Kith and Kin]], and we actually *solved it*. We now know that [[Oghma]] is involved, as well as the year 3454 and something hidden behind a portrait.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] wrote one hell of a letter.
