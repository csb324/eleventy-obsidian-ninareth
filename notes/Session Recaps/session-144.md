# Session 144

Still making our way through the [[Zhakastin Expedition]], we investigate the room of atrocities (specifically, an upsetting number of flayed bodies). We collect some [[necromantic spikes]]. Then we go into the larder and find a bunch of monsters from [[The Shadowfell]] lurking around. Troubling.

For detailed recap, see [[notes-144]]
