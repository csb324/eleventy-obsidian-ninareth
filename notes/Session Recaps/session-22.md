# Session 22: The Furnace
We're in [[The Furnace]], the headquarters of the [[Fire Raisers]]. This is the only place that name can be spoken.

We waited for a while. Costi messed with a [[Magically Resistant Chain]]. It seems weird!

Eventually [[Cinder]], a half-orc in red armor, came in to talk to us. First of all, to thank us for [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in|rescuing]] [[Niko]]. He asked what we'd like in return, and we asked for a handful of favors:

* They'll help us make it look good when we "escape" our "hostage situation"
* They'll make sure the various governments permanently forget that [[Rez]] was ever tied to [[Niko]]
* [[Freya]] asked for a cool axe or something, and maybe a shield
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked about armor training
* [[Costi]] would like to know more spells, please (and also, of course, information about [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]])
* [[Hugh]] would like a pet. Preferably a nocturnal pet? And, again, info on [[Costi's Dad]]
* [[Rez]] wants to meet the coolest wizard they've ever met. 

[[Freya]] considered asking them about the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles |Mysterious Circles]], but [[Cinder]] advised her not to -- if there's a symbol that's mysterious, sharing it more widely is probably going to bring trouble. So, she didn't.

And all of us wouldn't say no to some money. So he gave us some money, and he's going to see what he can do about the other things. Some sounded easy, others sounded a bit harder.

With respect to [[Costi's Dad]] in particular (and, IIRC, for [[Rez]]'s request as well), [[Cinder]] said he needed more from us. If we were really going to get access to the [[Fire Raisers]]' resources, we would need to prove that we were committed. There were certain questions (i.e. most questions) that he couldn't answer without a higher level of trust.

How could we earn that trust? Well, he actually wanted to ask us for a favor.

### Operation: Incriminating Letters

There are two Jalantan politicians, one [[The Guardians|Guardian]] and one [[The Providers|Provider]], who the [[Fire Raisers]] want out. Our job is to sneak some letters into their offices, and steal one item from each of them. See also: [[Operation Incriminating Letters]]

### Some conversation ensued.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was the only one even a little bit hesitant. She's still trying to stay on [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s good side, until she's figured out exactly how to extract herself. And something like this feels like it would *definitely* put her on his bad side.

[[Costi]] asked what [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] needed from them to make this seem like a good idea. She thought on it, and settled on this: She needed their word that they would help her out of the [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] situation, one way or another, when the time came. Pretty much everyone said "Of course, and also, we had assumed we were already going to do that" (with a side of "PLEASE can we murder your boss, I am DYING to murder your boss" from [[Costi]]). 

Another conversation about trust ensued. Starting to feel like a theme! 

(In the middle of all this, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gave [[Rez]] the circlet to talk to [[Vask|her brother]]. Now [[Vask]] is on an airship to [[Jalantar]]. Cool???)

Nonetheless, this helped. [[Hugh]] initiated a group hug. [[Freya]] did *not* lick [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s forehead, but did offer some kind words.

### So we're going to do it.

We'll need some help, so [[Cinder]] introduced us to [[Twigs]], a little blue goblin and demolitions expert. [[Cinder]] asked [[Twigs]] to exhaust all non-explosive solutions to a problem before using bombs... [[Twigs]] responded with finger guns. 

[[Niko]] showed up the next morning to say goodbye. He's going to lay low for a little while, but he said we'd probably see him soon.

Our first order of business was "escaping" our "hostages" [[Cinder]] told us what we were and were not permitted to tell the [[Zalevi Military|Zalevis]], and we gave him a practice round. We want to get this right.

We were blindfolded and escorted out of [[The Furnace]] on a lift, and found our way to a sewer grate, which we exited with a tremendous amount of drama (we left [[Twigs]] behind, because *"why is there a goblin in a green business suit with you"* was not a question we were prepared to answer. Still, meeting a new ally and immediately leaving them locked in a sewer is not the *most* welcoming thing we've ever done). 

## Talking to the Zalevis

The astonished guards took us directly to the [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar|Zalevi Embassy]], where [[Captain Fretze]] welcomed us with open arms (metaphorically. We were covered in shit, from the sewers.) Then, he started asking questions. [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] took the lead, explaining that we were knocked out in the [[Ring of Concussion|explosion]], then (through broken consciousness) dragged through the sewers and locked in cells, until [[Freya]] bravely killed one of our jailers with her unusually sharp teeth and got the keys to get everyone else out. 

Things seemed to be going well, until [[Rez]] mentioned the [[Hawktails]] -- a story that [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] wasn't buying. [[Costi]], noticing that, spoke up, to "confess" that he had heard [[Niko]]'s voice, and that [[Rez]] didn't need to cover for him. This was a better lie, but [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] was really on to us. Until [[Hugh]], who is *always* interested in who is having sex with whom, said "[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], you do not need to feel stupid that he seduced you". It seems like [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s embarrassment explains why we were all being so cagey about [[Niko]], which is a very convenient explanation! [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] said this was something that had happened often -- apparently, [[Niko]] gets around.

Finally, we showered and went back to our hotel, where we were due to meet [[Twigs]]. [[Twigs]] had gotten there first, and successfully convinced [[Loomis]] to let them take a shower in the staff locker room. In some *light* gaslighting, we told [[Loomis]] about our new friend who we had made plans with tonight, before the whole kidnapping thing happened. Surprise: it's the [[Twigs|shit-covered goblin]] from earlier! He said he'd send them to our room.
