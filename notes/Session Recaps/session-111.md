> [[ELA]] soldiers: We're kidnapping you. Drop your weapons.
> [[The Unforged Few]]: Yes! Kidnapping us! Exactly! I guess we should make this look good. In case we get scryed on. Okay, go ahead. Do you want to tie us up maybe? That would help. We have rope if you need it.
> [[ELA]] soldiers: What the fuck are you talking about
> [[Freya]]: HIT ME I WANNA FEEL ALIVE
> [[Thurath]]: * angry squeak *
