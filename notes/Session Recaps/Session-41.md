# Session 41: 

We go to dinner at the [[The Tiamat House]], which is now covered in silver tarps, with [[The Silver Halves]]. It's been cleaned up at this point, with many of the tapestries were covered up, including the Tiamat on the ceiling. They're going to begin demolition in a weekish, [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] is happy saying she's always wanted a house in [[The Fallsides]]

[[Pik]] and [[Freya]] bonded over being angry and agreed to a firendly fight. [[Costi]] asked to learn some magic from [[Magister]],  and let him copy a page from his spellbook. [[Rez]] and [[Vask]] talked about [[Ghez Yhutl]] and [[Father Thronestone]]. [[Victoria Several]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talked about the process of [[Vask]] convincing her to buy [[The Tiamat House]], and who she'll use her new vote in the [[Arkhosian Elections]] to support. [[Costi]] wants to chat with her about [[The Providers]] and the [[Arkhosian Elections]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] takled to [[Vask]] about his and [[Rez]]'s childhood and religious connection to the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]]

Suddenly, [[Rez Hires an Actor|a gnome with glasses and very bushy beard]] barges into the house with a very important message for [[Vask]], who has CHLAMYDIA. [[Hugh]] is worried, then sees for himself that nothing is wrong. 

[[Freya]] and [[Pik]] fight. [[Pik]] wins, but [[Costi]] makes up for it with a pie to the face.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sneaks off to tempt [[Samuel]] into a conversation with pie crusts. She tries to determine if he has strong feelings about revealing his origin, but it doesn't seem to land. 

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] stay at [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]'s house, while [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Rez]], [[Freya]] go back to the [[The Golden Gryffon]] to sleep. 

[[Freya]] wakes up in the night to [[The Curator]] waiting in her room. They look at her new claw tattoo, and seems to read what they do with a touch. She came specifically to learn her secrets. Asked "what is she after? what would she like", says her role is to shepard those in her collectino to be the best they can be. To know their goals to help them become true. [[Freya]] says she'd like to be able to go back home to [[Polaris]]. Says she was kicked and out and not to come back -- but doesn't know why. 

We've run afoul of someone she has a terse relationship with [[Threthdia Scrivit]]. Says her purposes are cross to hers, and would happy to lend us assistance. Recommends we act soon for our own best interest, that she doesn't take be slighted lightly. 

Says she can diminish some of [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s capabilities if we give [[The Curator]] advance notice, and she can make [[Freya]] able to talk to her whenever she likes. Pricked between her shoulders, creates a small procelain mask, and says all you have to do is think their name and they can communicate. Recommends we let her feel secure before we fight her, that the [[The Beauties of Shadow]] can be a bit cocky, but they've likely filled their ranks. We should accept her dinner invitation. Called her [[Grandmother Renthendi]]. Thinks we should be careful about more banderhobbs - that they might try to leave with one of us if they believe they're losing a fight. 

[[Freya]] also asked if she'd seen the symbol from her [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]], and said she'd look into it.

She wakes up to tell us about it -- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] senses that the mark is desecrated. We talked about maybe being careful in the future with [[The Curator]].

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] came back, and we all shared some perspectives. [[Rez]] talked about her worry for her family if people find out about the dragon scales, and take her family to be evil. [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] agreed she could sending her sister in [[Thelran Asari]] to warn her about the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] searching for [[Pleetos Alentas]]. [[Hugh]] also opened up about the order of his temple, and [[Moradin]] - why he takes it so personally about our doubt of [[Father Thronestone]]. We all understand each other better.

We also talked about our plan to stay safe on the road in the [[Vrolbekk Forest]], and [[Hugh]] remembered his spell that makes a hut to keep us safe. We went shopping for some provisions, namely lanterns and health potions.

We discussed stopping by [[Father Gryuu]] at the [[Jalantar Sunspot]], but decided against it since we don't know where that stone came from. 

Boots walking in a circle in a random glade - we all investiage and [[Costi]] puts them on. Turns out they're [[Boots of Endless Walking]]. Useful! 

On the road, [[Rez]] answered a [[Hugh]] riddle all by herself without any help from [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talked to [[Costi]] about [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], his status as a warlock, and his family ties. Costi says he found this out while snooping through some of his dad's things. It alluded to his work and job, showing he was a warlock and not a wizard. [[Hugh]] thinks back, and remembers [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] casting Eldritch Blast and using his sword. 

[[Samuel]] takes offense and starts pecking [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] as she tries to talk to [[Costi]] about his origin. She reveals, he's a fiend! But still seems loyal to Costi. We all talked about it, and Costi needs some time to think. 

[[Freya]] fell asleep thinking about the desecrated spot on her back, and the cold senstation it has in it. 

We make it to [[Tinzelven]], but it seems mostly empty and quiet. [[Abaria]]'s store seems open, and she gave us the scoop. [[Victor]] is in [[Jalantar]], [[Bliken Hammerov]] is in [[Arkhosia (City)]], [[Willen Guruden]] took bunch of folks to [[Arkhosia (City)]]. Says [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] didn't leave, and [[Deeksta]] is still keeping the town safe. 

We visit [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], he says [[Rez]]'s riddle machine is ready. It has two buttons, always press the right button and never the left (he thinks). [[Rez]] decides to try it out, turns out it the left. The first "what goes up but never comes down" [[Costi]] answers his age - and gets a cookie. [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] says he doesn't know how it works, but it does. Seems to be connected to the feywild. 

Came across [[Freya]]'s symbol while researching his rock bag, it's in the margins "[[The Unnatural Naturality]]: A history of the creation of the prime material plane and an examiniation of it's relationship with the elemental, outer, and mirror planes by T.Y. Gurscock" in 1753 - got in a used bookstore in [[Arkhosia (City)]] at [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]] about 40 years ago. 

Says [[Niko]] came through town after the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]], and that he needed to go handle a pressing family event. He reached out [[Winston]] for him. [[Niko]] introduced them, the two of them met during war, serving in [[korvez]] a border town of [[Zalev]] and [[Arkhosia]].
