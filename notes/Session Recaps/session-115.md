# Session 115

For detailed recap, see [[notes-115]]

We reported to [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] and handed over our prisoner (We also saw his elite kill squad, [[Teld's Dogs]], loping out of the tent. They give me a bad feeling). He gave us permission to heal! Great!

Then we mostly poisoned the water supply. 

It was [[Costi]]’s idea, encouraged by an omen from [[Hugh|Finn]]’s hearth (and a fun fact from one of his old [[AVAD]] professors). He polymorphed into a Eberronian purple tree frog, and [[Freya]] milked him for venom ([[Guu]] helped). We dissolved the venom into a canteen. [[Rez]] created a contraption - a sort of water-dispensing backpack for large birds. She made herself invisible. [[Costi]] turned [[Rez]] into a large bird. she managed to fly behind an eberronian soldier refilling the camp cistern and empty the poisoned canteen into the water supply — with a few near-catastrophes that [[Costi]] was able to avert. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh]] provided distractions (harp music and offers of general healing). It went great. 

Other things that happened:
- [[Hugh|Finn]] tried to scry on the interrogation of the [[ELA]] captives. [[Colvia Ghul]] noticed the sensor pretty immediately. good to know. 
- [[Fingers]] told [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] that [[Colvia Ghul]] works directly for the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]! She’s been on detail with the [[Eberronian Second Division]] for a year and a bit — some of Her [[Iounians]] came with her from the special intelligence division, and some joined later (from the second). Interesting!!!
- we played liars dice with [[Fingers]].
- [[Rez]] destroyed the extra ELA corpses by filling our sarcophagus with acid. Did you forget we had a sarcophagus? 
- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked [[Colvia Ghul]] if she could borrow some ivory strips to cast legends lore for a religious matter. [[Colvia Ghul|Colvia]] said yes, only if she could also get the information. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] said that probably wouldn’t be possible but she’d pray on it. 
- a fellow soldier named [[Mastan]] (and his partner) timidly invited [[Costi]] to dinner and  cookies. They were his mom’s recipe. His mom was an [[ELA]] sympathizer — he and [[Costi]] have both overcome so much. 
	- This boy did not want to join the army but he took out a bad loan in [[Jezeten]] and this was the only solution. I guess we should feel bad about the deaths of Eberronian soldiers too. 
- [[Hugh|Finn]] got to talk to [[Magister]]! They commiserated about robot issues. biologics just don’t understand. Especially about the trauma. 
	- from magister: [[Vask]] jumped off the airship, disappeared for a few days, and upon his return said they shouldn’t go to [[Zalev]] for a whole. cool.
	- Also, we’ll probably see [[The Silver Halves]] in [[New Fairhaven]]!
- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] healed [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], after the poisoning… But healing takes time. And it took enough time for [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] to shit himself. [[Fingers]] watched and thought it was hilarious.
