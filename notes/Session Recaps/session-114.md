# Session 114

We fought the [[ELA]]! 

Our goals were:
- Stay bloodied (don't heal above the level that we'd been given permission to heal above)
- Take 10% alive (and with twelve attackers, that means 2, because [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] rounds up)
- If Eberronian soldiers die.... oh well.

We almost accomplished this, but ended up with only one captive. [[Fingers]] had the excellent idea to kick two of of the corpses into [[My Hole]], so we did that -- now it looks like there were only ten attackers, and we have the right number of captives. 

[[Fingers]]'s vibe was less "setting you up to rat you out later" and more "I don't want my ass kicked either (but if it means I also could fuck you over later, that's a plus)".
