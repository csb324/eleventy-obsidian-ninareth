# Session 17: Miscasts & mishaps

#### Before the concert:
- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] went with [[Hugh]] to [[Truesilver]]'s [[Dragonsfire Forge|hearth]] to play the harp. 
- [[Hugh]] did some healing, and one of the devotees of [[Moradin]] asked to help. So, it's possible that the hearth won't be totally unmanned when [[Hugh]] isn't there.
- [[Rez]] went to work and poured some good iron. She learned what it takes to make a prayer dagger. Maybe she'll be a cleric of [[Moradin]]! [[Hugh]] mentioned that the followers of Moradin in the Acedian mountains tried to burn him alive... Rez is less interested in becoming a cleric of Moradin.
- [[Costi]] copied down some spells from [[Professor Vendorsmere]] and learned Mirror Image.
- [[Freya]] tried to turn into an owl an ended up fighting the floorboards. She had a vision of [[Petra]], someone she seems ready to kill. 

#### The concert

We arrived at [[The Needle Cushion]] and [[Jenson Davour]] had our spots reserved in the front row. [[Giary]], [[Innis]], and [[Qik]] showed up, but *notably* [[Niko]] did not. (Giary confessed to [[Costi]] that this was troubling, but insisted to the rest of us that it was nothing to worry about). 

[[Hugh]] told [[Qik]] that [[Costi]]'s favorite author is Sanderson Brando. [[Qik]] is, at any point, ready to knife someone and ready to fall in love. Your correspondent is obsessed with her. 

We got drinks, we chatted, we waited for the show to start.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked [[Giary]] how he and [[Niko]] met. Giary said they became friends while doing shared activities. But also suggested he didn't entirely trust [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] either. So. 

[[The Miscasts]] are *really something.* We had a great time. [[Costi]] and [[Qik]] are now fully converted fans. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] has more respect for them than she expected to. [[Hugh]] has never seen a concert before but liked it (although did later tell [[Lorian]] that he preferred [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp music). [[Freya]] was just having a bad day.

As the show ended, some girls from [[Redscale]] behind us started bitching about [[Rez]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Freya]], and [[Hugh]] were not having it (all in their own way). 

> Ohmigod really? you're going backstage?? Could you find something *really* sweaty back there for me?? And then *eat it*.
> - [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]

Turns out, those girls were going backstage too, because one of them had [[Rian]] wrapped around her finger. 

### The green room

[[Freya]], [[Innis]], and [[Giary]] stayed in the main venue to keep an eye out for [[Niko]]. The rest of us went backstage, and [[Rez]] brought specialty drinks for the guys -- something they invented together in [[Kazan]] called a Throat Lover. 

[[Josh]] welcomed us by asking everyones name and telling us he loved us. It seems like he's *actually like this*. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] went to talk to [[Jenson Davour|Jenson]], who was snorting [[Ghir Root]] and talking business with some folks. She congratulated him on putting together such a compelling show. He said he'd asked around about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and had heard all good things -- and wanted to make clear that he did not intend to poach her from her [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|current situation]], and that it would be great if she didn't mention that he'd offered. And anyway, he took it back (haha... unless?). She told him not to worry, and that she wouldn't mention the encounter.

He (among may others) also said [[Rian]] was off his game tonight, and seemed exhausted -- that girl [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]] was really keeping him up late and fucking up his focus. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], who already did not like [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]], said she'd help try to run the girls off. 

[[Rez]] and [[Costi]] went to talk to [[Jax|Curse]], the bad boy dulcimer player. He said he was looking forward to the outsiders leaving so he could stop acting so brooding and aloof. He also metioned that [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]] was a problem. 

[[Hugh]] went to talk to [[Lorian]], who seems more reserved (and has no illusions about his own level of talent). [[Hugh]] noticed [[Lorian]]'s symbol of [[Corellon Larethian]] and waved [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] over. They talked about the [[Larethian Rose]], which apparently will never wilt in Adrienne's care as long as Corellon remains in her heart. So. Uh. That's something.

All the while, [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]] was all over [[Rian]] and her two friends were not-far-off. Eventually the pair of them went upstairs.

[[Jenson Davour|Jenson]] then came to us in a bit of a panic. A meeting he'd been planning was suddenly *now*, and [[Rian]] was upstairs with [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]]. Could the five of us please go get [[Rian]] and perhaps embarrass the girl enough that she would back off for a while? We said absolutely yes. ([[Hugh]] had a bad feeling about this).

### The bedroom

[[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] came up with a plan to impersonate [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]]'s two friends to get her to open the door (which it turns out was unlocked). [[Costi]] listened through the door and heard moans, but not the good kind of moans. We started to think perhaps something wasn't right. But we came in, and thats when we saw [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]] who is some kind of horrible witch creature thing -- pale skin, stringy hair, deep wrinkles, spooky voice, the whole shebang. She seemed to be using an uncomfortable-and-unconscious [[Rian]] to channel magic, and that magic was used to animate some furniture. 

Combat ensued!!

> "Tables are meant to be put things on, not put on people!!"
>  - [[Rez]]

[[Hugh]] had tried a few times to heal [[Rian]] and wake him up, but it hadn't worked. Toward the end of the fight, [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]] knocked [[Costi]] unconscious and was getting away. And [[Hugh]] once again asked [[TrueSilver]] for assistance.

> "If you're not going to help me heal, help me *hurt*"
> - [[Hugh]]

And he rolled a crit on guiding bolt, killing [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]] (who seriously would have otherwise gotten away).

Rattled by this, but understanding this was possibly a frame of mind that would help him remember, Hugh tried to search his mind for a little more information about [[Costi's Dad]]. 

He got a flashback: a hulking figure of a man, pointed ears, monsterous teeth. An Eberronian soldier backing away from the carnage. The huge man grabbing the soldier and throwing him to the ground, saying "we don't retreat". Hugh doesn't remember names, but remembers that he *hates* this man, which is not a feeling he likes to feel.

[[Freya]] did an excellent job searching [[The Beauties of Shadow#Jecka|Jecka]]'s body, and found three things:
1. A little leather [[Bag of Screams]]
2. A golden diadem on her brow, [[Circlet of Sending]]
3. A [[Beauties of Shadow Dog Tag]] on a chain around her neck, with writing none of us know how to read. It was about to melt into her skin when [[Freya]] pulled it out with her talons. 

We got back to the green room, and [[Giary]] suggested we get the fuck out of there. He's right, probably. But [[Rez]] wanted to close the loop with [[Jenson Davour]]. So the rest of us went back through [[The Promenade]] to [[The Sheath and Sickle]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] let [[Giary]] know that she would not hesitate to burn his bar to the ground if he didn't get [[Rez]] back safely. 

On the walk back, [[Hugh]] told [[Costi]] he hadn't shared everything about [[Costi's Dad]]. He pulled out [[Vlad Grosu Patch]], which for [[Hugh]] is difficult to read. It says

> Vladimir Grossu 
> Corporal 
> Beating Hearts 

[[Hugh]] said it was from before [[Costi's Dad]] died. [[Costi]] said [[Hugh]] can hang onto it if he wanted to.

And so we all made it to [[The Sheath and Sickle]], where it seems like some shit is about to unfold.
