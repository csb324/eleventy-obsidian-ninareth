# Session 124

For detailed recap, see [[notes-124]]

Finn told us that he joined the military. We asked him why. Somehow this turned into a conversation about love and death. [[Freya]] does not want us to leave her!

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talked to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] about our role in [[A Murder of Dukes]]. She also asked about [[Von]], and sienna warned her not to break [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]]’s heart. 

[[Freya]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] went to the made fors camp and talked to [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]], who gave [[Hugh|Finn]] the warforged bracers we got from [[Teld's Dogs]]. 

## [[Fingers]]’s party

We all got dressed up to go to a party! Three of us wore eberronian military uniforms in some capacity, even though only two of us are actually in the military. [[Rez]] just has to prove she looks good in it. 

The party is HUGE. There is so much fanfare. So much drama. So many fingers. 

We found [[Marigold]] in the magical maze. She doesn’t seem great at mazes. [[Rez]] somehow got into the walls and made friends with the maze operator. 

> EAT THE FOOD

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is set to perform at 10:30, introducing [[Fingers]] for her… coronation? Swearing in? Whatever it is when you become a Major.
