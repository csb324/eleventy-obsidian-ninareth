# Session 24: Super subtle reconnaissance

We woke up and [[Twigs]] was gone. We hope to see them again soon.

We decided to split up for our errands, and split the party money between us. Team Praise District ([[Hugh]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and [[Costi]]) would buy potions, and Team Promenade ([[Freya]] and [[Rez]]) would buy *some stuff*, based on whatever [[Rez]] found inspiring. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] spoke to [[Loomis]] about the ghosts, and told him we'd pay for any damages to the furniture. [[Loomis]] also asked how much longer we'd be staying, and we decided it would be until the end of the week.

Downstairs, [[Lorian]] was waiting for us in the lobby! He'd come by to set up that dinner plan with [[The Miscasts]] that [[Jenson Davour]] had invited us to. We'll have a late dinner at [[Kalikar's Bistro]], after they perform for a potential investor. 

## Team Praise District

### The Grove
[[Lorian]] was headed to [[Corellon's Grove]], so he walked with us. He and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] played together in the spot that she'd found with [[Hugh]] earlier. It went well. Some vines grew up around [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp, which, seems unusual. 

[[Hugh]] was ready to take the [[Summoning Stone]] for un-ghosting, but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] had an idea and wanted to hold on to it. She asked [[Lorian]] if he knew who was in charge here, and he said "that's not really how this works, but, I do have a friend."

So [[Lorian]] introduced us to [[Dawenys]]. [[Dawenys]] and [[Lorian]] have *history*, and [[Lorian]] got very gently roasted, which he was completely unable to handle. [[Costi]] was also unable to handle it. 

But anyway, [[Dawenys]] works at [[Corellon's Grove]], in the caves, tending to the roots of plants, or something. She passed along the response from [[Fig]] (basically a thumbs-up emoji), and invited [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to come back and learn more about [[Corellon Larethian]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked if being here could help with the [[Summoning Stone]], because sometimes it feels like the vibes here are helping her do things. 

[[Dawenys]] couldn't do much about the [[Summoning Stone]], but did write an excellent letter to the [[Temple of Pelor in Jalantar]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] finally tried just dispelling the stone, and it seems like it's not easy to dispell. 

### The Forge
We went back to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]], where [[Hugh]] wanted to get rid of all our cursed and haunted objects. But we were going to have to *pay them* to take the [[Bag of Screams]] off our hands. So, we're keeping the [[Bag of Screams]].

However, [[Father Thronestone]] was happy to purchase the [[Summoning Stone]] from us. It seemed to him that the stone contained a lot of magical energy, and if that energy could be separated from the ghosts, it would be a pretty powerful stone. So we sold it to him for 5 small diamonds, worth 100gp each.

Finally, [[Hugh]] went to [[TrueSilver]]'s hearth, where it looks like people have been hanging out! They had a cheese board and everything! 

### Potion Store
We sold some poison orange moss and bought some potions. See: [[Group Inventory]]

### The Library

We forgot to go to the library, although we still want to. We were just distracted by what was going on with...

## Team Promenade
### The Wayfinders
[[Freya]] checked in at the [[Jalantar Wayfinders Outpost]]. [[Akros]] is back! He got hurt fighting a gorgon, but he's okay. [[Veritude]] is taking care of him. He'll be ready to talk to [[Freya]] tomorrow. Guess we have more errands to do.

### To the Promenade
When I say [[Rez]] was having a weird day, I cannot emphasize enough how weird her day was. 

[[Freya]] disguised herself as a regular human-ish, elf-ish, *not* half-elf person, and [[Rez]] put on a bit of makeup to try to cover her scales.

[[Freya]] and [[Rez]] made it to [[Pent Logging|Pent's lumberyard]], and figured they'd walk around. Plan A was to be subtle and see if they could potentially overhear something, or sneak around. The lumberyard was fenced and heavily guarded.

Plan A went horribly wrong. They were not subtle at all. In fact, they were so unsubtle that a guard approached them to ask what the hell they wanted.

Quick thinking, [[Rez]] introduced herself as Amy, and [[Freya]] introduced herself as Courtney. They said they were both looking for work. The guard introduced herself as [[Limley]], and she was happy to give them a tour.

The doors locked behind them.

### [[Pent Logging]]

Limley seemed willing to hire "Amy" and "Courtney", but that doesn't mean she wasn't suspicious (especially of [[Rez]], who just seemed shifty). 

[[Freya]] was increasingly aware that her hour of disguise was almost gone. So she told [[Limley]] she had lied about her appearance, because of embarrassment about.... something. She also told [[Limley]] she really had to pee. 

In the bathroom, [[Freya]] emptied her entire herbalism kit into the sink tried to create some kind of way to disguise herself as *maybe a different firbolg*. She successfully created a yellow mush, and rubbing it on herself turned her blue fur green. 

It also gave her a painful skin reaction!

So, now visibly ill, [[Freya]] returned from the bathroom. [[Limley]] found this alarming. When [[Limley]] went to get [[Ferro Whipwind]], the supervisor looking for new employees for a "big project", [[Rez]] found a chance to rub some of this very-poisonous paste on her skin, but [[Rez]] just has such great skin that she didn't react to it at all. Unfortunately this was not the desired outcome -- but minor illusion works too. When [[Limley]] came back, [[Freya]] made the bold but ultimately crucial choice to eat some of the mixture, causing an instant projectile vomit response. 

They were ushered out of the lumberyard. They told [[Limley]] they were staying at the [[Tail Up Goat]], a tavern in [[The Promenade]], so we now have a plan for those two to make an appearance there, in case [[Limley]] follows up.
