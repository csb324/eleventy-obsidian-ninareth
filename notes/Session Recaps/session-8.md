# Session 8: Attack of the Gruung

#### Combat: [[Gruung Attack on Tinzelven]]

**Highlights:**
- We (the players) noticed Hugh still hasn't killed anyone
- A red gruung hid in a barrel. [[Costi]] found him in the barrel, and put a cloud of daggers in the barrel with him. Then [[Rez]] breathed acid breath into the barrel. The barrel was not a good place to be.
- Freya was swallowed by a frog and then sliced her way out of the frog.
- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] got pecked to shit by birds. She also stayed sitting until like, the last round of combat.
- [[Rez]] solved [[Hugh]]'s latest riddle, mid-battle. The answer was "water".

Once the [[Gruung]] seemed subdued, we went out to find [[Deeksta]] and regroup. She confirmed that the surviving Gruung had run off. We also saw that some of the folks in [[Tinzelven]] had died in the fighting (although [[Hugh]] was able to save [[Willa]] with Spare The Dying)

Nonetheless, [[Hugh]] really did not feel good about what went down. He and [[Freya]] had a conversation about nature and death and war and whether any of it is natural. 

The rest of us got to cleaning up the [[Laborers Hall]], or, like, helping. We talked to [[Captain Fretze]], who came in for a drink and told us we seemed pretty new at this but pretty capable for our lack of experience. The Zalevis left for Jalantar, but told us to check in with them when we arrived because [[Doha]] promised [[Rez]] she'd draw a picture of the [[session-7|Toasty Costi]] situation

Also among the dead: [[Eros]]. So, that'll be interesting.
