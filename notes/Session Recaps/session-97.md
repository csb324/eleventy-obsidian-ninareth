# Session 97

Hugh met a giant badger. Costi and Rez went back to the library but didn’t find much. Adrienne went to the quartermaster for supplies and bought some potions (and the quartermaster showed off a cool new arm for the SVN model). Freya worked out. 

we had dinner with Fivey and his advisor, who seems weird. He worships [[Kelemvor]], although not in an “organized religion” way. They told us a bit more about how the [[Bone Breakers]] operate. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] almost forgot she promised to hold a concert, despite spending most of yesterday practicing. It went okay. 

then we left for [[Viliki]]. Luckily, travel went smoothly. We traveled with [[Trisha]], who has secret contacts along the road (a game warden)

We got to the town and spoke to the Mayor who has a name. He told us about mysterious fishing deaths and gave us an office and told us what hotel to go to.
