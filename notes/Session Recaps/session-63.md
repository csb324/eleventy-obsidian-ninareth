# Triple date

Ok. Uh. Dear god. 

First things first. [[Hugh]] contacted [[Costi's mom]], who said [[Pruvki Forgaveat]] would get to us when he got to us. 

[[The Curator]] then paid [[Jade]] a visit, asking her to tell them a mystery. [[Jade]] flipped through her notes and ended up telling them about the [[Our invisible friend|invisible friend]] situation. [[The Curator]] said that it *was* interesting! They gave us some new information - that the pursuer was an elf man, who had a "spicy core". So. That's interesting.

In the morning, [[The Unforged Few]] talked about this, and tried to remember whether [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was half-elf on her mom's side or on her dad's side. 

Then, we split up for some errands (we'd like to make progress on our [[Death Halls Heist]], but we're waiting on [[Victoria Several]] to get back to us with potentially more information about people buried there). 

[[Jade]] and [[Hugh]] sat side by side, reading [[The Unnatural Naturality]] and a picture book about a corgi, respectively. [[Hugh]] finished his book. [[Jade]] did not.

[[Costi]] asked [[Welcome]] if there were any people in the [[Chapel of the Lost]] who needed high-end mercenaries. She said *basically* no, but she'd be happy to talk about our options more over drinks, maybe at 8? And maybe also bring [[Rez]] and [[Jade]]?

[[Rez]] and [[Freya]] went to the [[Arkohsia City Wayfinder Outpost]], so that [[Freya]] could get her world-crossing tattoo. They met [[Naya]], the leader of the Arkhosia City [[Wayfinders]] and an old friend of [[Rawley]] and [[Akros]]. She's read [[Rawley]]'s copy of [[Kith and Kin]]! She gave [[Freya]] a few more names of people to trust - and implied that there were other wayfinders *not* to trust. 

[[Freya]] also asked if she'd ever seen a Firbolg before, and she said no - but also said that [[Freya]] should ask [[Akros]] the same question.

[[Freya]], kicking herself for not asking *everyone* this question, asked [[Rez]] if she'd ever seen a firbolg before. It turns out, she has! 

When they got back to the [[Chapel of the Lost]], the whole group talked about it, because that's objectively weird. [[Rez]] said she was really little, and doesn't remember the details, but the Firbolg was someone talking to her dad, and they were in the southern cities, probably. Their name was maybe Fred? Or something that sounds like Fred.

We then asked, "Who even *is* [[Rez's Dad|your dad]] and why was he talking to a firbolg in the southern cities?" [[Rez]] was cagey about it! But eventually she told us that her dad is a diplomat of some kind. Someone who "talks to government people but he's not government but he like, has a lot of government *friends*". He used to be an adventurer, kind of like us. He's also a warlock, it seems, like [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]]. 

[[Costi]] asked [[Welcome]] to bring us a book on the races. It was racist, and didn't have much information on Firbolgs other than that they're nomadic and they don't seem to usually know how to read. Little do they know! 

[[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] went to bother [[Henrik]] about [[Branton Spout]], and found out that her dad *is* the elf-side of the family. He also mentioned that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] would want to speak to us in four or five days about another task. The [[Death Halls Heist]] is just the first thing he needs from us before the elections. 

[[Hugh]] heard back from [[Victoria Several]] - she said she might have more information in a few days, but she does have an ancestor interred at the [[Halls of the Dead]] who we could say we were visiting.

Of course, we didn't know how much that costs, and we'd gotten the impression that it was one of those "if you have to ask, you can't afford it" situations. [[Jade]], a truth seeker, went to go find out the truth about how much it costs to visit a buried loved one (versus a buried stranger). [[Hugh]] joined her. They spoke to a goblin attendant of the shrine of [[The Raven Queen]]. 

ALSO WE WENT ON A TRIPLE DATE
