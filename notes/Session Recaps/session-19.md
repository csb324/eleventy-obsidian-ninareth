# Session 19: Getting to the embassy
Back at [[The Sheath and Sickle]] with [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]], [[Innis]] (who was drinking hard), and [[Giary]], we got to  [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in|planning]]. 

[[Costi]] found an interesting piece of [[Niko]]'s jewelry in secret (something that [[Srictha]] had asked about, not that we know that), then did a little scheme to "find" it again. It's a silver ring with a ruby. The ring is *extremely* explosive, and doubly effective against structures. We were hoping to use it as part of the break-in.

[[Giary]] offered to get the nice ale out. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] went with him, to get the chance to ask about [[Niko]] -- he's clearly been talking shit about her to [[Costi]], so, is she about to die saving the life of someone who just talks shit about her? [[Giary]] said no -- [[Niko]] must trust her (and the whole group) at least a little, if he's bringing them to [[The Sheath and Sickle]]. And, he said, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] clearly has her reasons for being how she is. He understands that.

But also, risking her life for [[Niko]] is exactly what [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] would tell her to do, if he were trying to gain their trust. Skepticism is warranted.

[[Rez]] wrote a letter to her brother [[Vask]], telling him in a subtle way to perhaps leave [[Kazan]], on the  chance that we get caught. If she's a wanted woman, because of her paperwork connection to [[Niko]] (or, perhaps, because of getting-caught), her brother has at least a snowball's chance of getting out.

[[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] made a request of [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] - some pixie dust, to help the prisoners escape more quickly. [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] did not like this ask! His sister, it turns out, was kidnapped for this very reason and is now being kept in a jar somewhere, getting shaken for dust. We told him we'd help him find her, after all this was over. And in return, he did give us the pixie dust.

[[Kara]] came over and drew up some blueprints of the [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar]] from memory. They were somewhat helpful. She also agreed to come with us, on the condition that we free all of the [[Arazoak]]. We said yes, but, within reason. If we were about to get murdered and it was time to bail, we were going to bail, and she should do the same. She agreed.

She also told us she didn't know where the door to the dungeon was - it was well hidden. But our friends outside would need to break in as close to that door as possible, so we'd need to find it.

To redirect suspicion, we decided to disguise ourselves as [[Hawktails]] - A radically violent pacifist political party, who would also have a motive to fuck up the famously-warmongering Zalevi government. They don't seem to do much, lately, but they do wear feathers. So [[Giary]] went and got us some feathers. He got a kick out of this idea. 

We talked a lot about the plan. 

**The plan:** Walk in and ask [[Captain Fretze]] for a tour.  Once inside, locate the secret door to the dungeon. Message [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] (an excellent go-between, given that he is tiny and invisible and can fly), and instruct the Outside Team to detonate a distraction bomb near the front door, and then a subsequent bomb large enough to get them all inside (probably using the ring).  Then, get everyone inside, get our weapons if necessary, and get folks out. Finally, we do not leave the embassy! We stay and act like scared bystanders. 

The next morning we went shopping! We picked up:
- A bunch of healing potions (greater and regular)
- Ball bearings, nets, rope, and elements for mischief 
- Masks and cloaks for disguises
- A lockbox

## At the embassy

Literally, we showed up and asked for a tour, saying we were friends of [[Captain Fretze]]. This was an insane thing to do. The guard at the gate, [[Rahbu]], was delighted to bring us inside, looking forward to the spectacle of how absolutely roasted we were about to get. Except, joke's on her because we *are* friends of [[Captain Fretze]]. Or at least, that's his opinion.

(We forgot to plant our explosives, so [[Innis]] will have to make do with the exploding arrows on their own).

[[Captain Fretze]] indeed offered us a tour. He was charming as ever. He is also a terrible person. We did our best to be friendly and engaging -- except [[Costi]], who did an excellent job looking embarrassed to be here (due to the [[session-7|toasty costi]] situation). [[Hugh]] did an excellent impression of a guy who's never seen anything like this before, mostly because he's never seen anything like this before.

[[Rahbu]] took our weapons, *except [[Costi]]'s* because he successfully convinced her and [[Captain Fretze]] that he literally can't swing it. 

[[Doha]] gave [[Rez]] the [[session-7|Toasty Costi]] drawing. It's actually really good. [[Rez]] offered to help [[Doha]] find an art patron back in [[Kazan]]. 

[[Captain Fretze]] said he'd come to [[Jalantar]] for a mission that got completed faster than he thought it would, and soon he'd be going back to [[Zalev City]] to celebrate their success with a festival for the [[Steppelord]]. It was going to be a really great festival, he said, and we should all come. (The surprise ingredient is mass execution, of the exact people we are here to free).

We got a bit of a [[Zalev]] civics lesson, and met a slave named [[Erdiq]], who has a brand of a horseshoe on his forehead. [[Captain Fretze]] is very unkind to this man. 

## The ambassador & company

[[Captain Fretze]] had a treat for us! We could meet the ambassador! What an honor. 

We entered the room and saw two men: [[Darfu Zeen]], the Zalevi ambassador to Jalantar; and [[El'Haliand|Colonel Finn Elâ€™Haliand]], [[Captain Fretze]]'s boss (who didn't expect to see him there). We did the approprate amount of bowing, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] caught [[El'Haliand]]'s curiousity. They've met before. [[El'Haliand]] is a friend of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s, from [[Redscale|school]].

They spent a moment catching up, and he mentioned that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] will be in [[Jalantar]] in a week or two, to see the [[Bellisime]] sing at [[The Pirate Queen]]. *What a wonderful coincidence.*

## Anyway, back to our tour.

We wound up in the history halls, when [[Freya]] noticed an unusual seam in a saddle. Something that could be, perhaps, a lever. Before she had the chance to point it out to the rest of us, there was a noise. *Another* explosion. And not coming from our people (that we know of). But, it *is* a distraction explosion, and that's exactly what we were planning on.

So, we're left in the room with [[Rahbu]], while [[Captain Fretze]] goes to secure the perimiter.
