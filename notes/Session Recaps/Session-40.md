# Session 40: 

[[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] goes to [[Princely Pies]] to meet [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. We meet the ogre owner who has been supported by Julian, Princely. [[Hugh]] went to help him cook, to [[Henrik]]'s concern.

[[Henrik]] and [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] created the rest of us, wanted to know what we've been up to. He offered to take part in a [[Rez]] prank on [[Vask]]. We recapped what we learned about [[Threthdia Scrivit]]. He said he would consider helping us if we complete a task for him. Said we should let him know if we intend to go, he'll give us an alibi but we need to NOT be seen there. 

A former employee of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s has been living in one of his properties. years ago, his gambling debts transferred his property to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. He's recently acquired an item that he wants -- if he parts with it Julian will forgive a significant portion of his debts and continue living in his house. If he doesn't he will need to leave, and pay Julian what he owes. The item is an instrument, [[Magical Flute]], but doesn't want to tell us the details. At one point was a rather impressive musician, but hasn't been active for years and is now an elderly recluse. Named [[Damien]]. He prefers it not get messy, but wants his house to stay in good condition. 

He also flagged that timing would work out well, because [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Costi]] will be going to [[Arkhosia (City)]] for the [[Arkhosian Elections]] for him. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] also paid [[Rez]] for information on what [[Threthdia Scrivit]] is preparing for the next theatre season in [[Jalantar]]. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] snuck back to talk to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] about her employment. He said as soon as the [[Arkhosian Elections]], and it's subsequent deals, they can negotiate the end of their work. She can be confident she'll be done with her role in the next three to fourth months. 

We all talked about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s potential retirement and the relationship [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] has with him in general. 

We go to talk to [[Father Thronestone]] at the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. We gave him [[Burru Ilp]]'s papers and the code. He rewarded us with the [[Blow Em]] and claws tattoo, and 300gp. He's going to confess and try to make right. [[Hugh]] and [[Costi]] write a testimonial on [[Father Thronestone]]'s behalf. He ended up with only a brief suspension from running his workshop for the next two weeks. 

[[Rez]] [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Freya]] talked to [[Ghez Yhutl]] at the [[Temple of  Platinum Dragon in Jalantar]] about [[Jorus]]. Says the OOTPD has people watching, convinved him this was a secret mission from [[Bahamat]]. Last Krokkiear of every month they have a dinner open to all for OOTPD interest. Code phrase it's okay to talk "can I interest you in a curious folio?" 

[[Freya]] spoke to the [[Wayfinders]], told them about the upcoming work for Julian. They said [[Akros]] wanted to talk to her but she should come back. She also wanted to send a letter to [[Rowley]], but they mentioned the letter would take months to deliver. That's how the mail works. [[Freya]] was disappointed. 

We all get back and have a chat about boundaries and who learns what, who tells them, and how. 

Decided to end to the day getting pies and going to dinner, eating with the [[The Silver Halves]] at the Tiamat house.
