# Session 56

We talked to the young fellow. He gave us a map of the cave, and the location where he spotted some copper -- and felt something sticky. 

So, we went into the cave. There's fuckin spiders in there! SO many. 

We developed a plan. The plan was: fire. Fire on a rope, fire around the edge of the pit... fire. 

We had a small handful of bad natural 1s. Rez was dropped into a pit. Jade, who had caught herself on a rock, found herself no longer holding that rock. et cetera. 

Giary made some choices that were not necessarily to his advantage. 

But anyway, spiders. The spiders (who are humanoids, by the way) start coming and they don't stop coming. Unless you blow them up with dynamite. which, it turns out, one of us knows how to summon! so we blew up the cave and we did a very good job. It may have been collapsing behind us when we left. These things will happen. 

The whole thing took about fifteen minutes. Now, we're going to the farmer's house for dinner. Costi wants to talk to him about the elections. And more importantly, I assume we're pretty hungry.
