# We meet the invisble friend

We woke up to a hungover [[Giary]]. He admitted that being a small dog is actually pretty nice. We also got a chance to talk to [[Figs]], before [[Costi]] turned him into a clownfish so that we could talk business with [[Giary]]. Hopefully this will help him learn to swim.
