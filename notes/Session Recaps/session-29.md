# Session 29: The session about goo
We picked up in [[Ellinev Del]]'s office and found out that she and [[Victor]] were in the [[Arkhosian Military]] together. She's also trying to get abolition on [[The Providers]]' platform in the upcoming [[Arkhosian Elections]], and seemed quite aware that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] would . Hugh, meanwhile, helped someone with a skylight.

After that meeting, we decided to go to  [[The Fiddlers Respite]] and see how our friends were doing. [[Innis]] seemed happy to see us, and business is booming. [[Qik]] was happy to see us too, but mostly [[Costi]]. One of the other girls also seemed to know the truth about our involvement in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]], so, that's fun. 

Our plan for the afternoon: make something similar to [[Vigo Underswell]]'s cloudy potion vial, the one we were told to [[Operation Incriminating Letters|steal]]. Like the decoy ring, a decoy potion could probably buy us some time. [[Innis]] gave us a variety of small bottles. 

When we left, we split up. [[Costi]] went to [[The Black Gull]] to buy some snacks for [[Samuel]] and [[Maurice]]. Samuel, by the way, has a white feather in his tail now. 

[[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] went to [[Redscale]] to hang signs for some reason. 

[[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] went to a few markets to get grocery store items, for goo-making. [[Freya]] mentioned that she was a bit concerned about the way they'd left things at [[Pent Logging]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] said we probably had some time before that became a problem. She was more concerned about those [[The Beauties of Shadow|witches]] from the miscasts concert. And, speaking of, was [[The Beauties of Shadow]] ever really a student at [[Redscale]]? [[Juliette]] would probably know. So they also went to [[Redscale]]'s campus. 

They didn't find Juliette, but on campus, they saw a sign that said [[Rez]] was looking to hire an actor. It also said to find her at [[Seven Hooves]]. Weird!

[[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] made a bet. If [[Rez]] is trying to hire a stand-in to be [[Vask|her brother]], Freya wins. Adrienne isn't sure who she thinks Rez is trying to get someone to impersonate, but she wants to call it before it happens. Whoever loses buys [[Samuel]]'s next round of bugs.

Back at [[The Golden Gryffon]], we held a goo-making contest. None of us were excellent at making goo, but [[Hugh]]'s looked best. 

[[Rez]] said she was going out. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tried to join, but mentioned the [[Seven Hooves]] and made everyone suspicious. [[Costi]] detected everyone's thoughts and realized several people in the room were full of shit. No one liked this from [[Costi]]. But [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] ended up telling [[Costi]] that [[Rez]] was up to something secret.

In the end we all went to [[Seven Hooves]] and saw [[Dorian]] and [[Ulia Glorsbade]] again. [[Rez]] won some money playing sixes. No one approached her about the poster. 

## The next day
We made our way to [[The Publics]] so that we could meet with [[Vigo Underswell]] right before his rendezvous with [[The Stagehands]], and an invisible contingent ([[Hugh]] and [[Rez]]) could stay behind in his office to steal the potion and plant the letter. We were welcomed by a little shithead named [[Preston Screk]], who seemed very excited to meet us (but would have been more excited to meet all five of us). We told him (and [[Vigo Underswell|Underswell]]) that [[Hugh]] had been malfunctioning, and that bringing an Eberronian war device into a government building didn't seem like the best idea, so [[Rez]] had stayed behind with them. 

We told our [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]] story for the zillionth time (including the bit about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sleeping with [[Niko]], which she asked [[Vigo Underswell|Underswell]] to keep quiet). [[Vigo Underswell]]'s office is full of portraits of previous Underswells, and it's all very fine-looking. Emphasis on *looking*. 

As [[Vigo Underswell|Underswell]] walked us out, he invited us to be his guests at the ball for Sheila Perils feast day. And then we were intercepted by [[Rhy Zahn]], a reporter for [[The Talon]]. [[Rhy Zahn]] wanted a quote from each of us, and oh boy did he get one. [[Costi]] did his best to keep his opinions to himself, but then said them out loud anyway. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] attempted damage control. We're all very worried about [[Zalev]]'s crimes... which are the unlawful arrests of random Jalantan people. 

Anyway, something's going on between [[Rhy Zahn]] and [[Vigo Underswell]]. Their relationship seems complicated.

## MEANWHILE
[[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] were still in the office. They saw [[Preston Screk]] come in and mutter about how much he hated his boss (relatable). [[Rez|Rez "I know how to pick locks" Tanin]] definitely successfully picked a drawer lock on Underswell's desk, after [[Hugh]] located the vial with some Cleric magic. It's definitely not broken now, and there definitely weren't several rounds of mending involved. 

Once they'd pulled that off, [[Vigo Underswell]] and [[Preston Screk]] came back. Looks like [[Preston Screk]] is going to accompany him on his rendezvous. Like anyone about to go pick up some drugs, [[Vigo Underswell]] snorted some drugs and got his guns out of the other locked drawers. He noticed the drawer [[Rez]] had been messing with was slightly scuffed. He accused [[Preston Screk]], who denied touching it. 

When they left, he locked the office behind him. Which posed a problem, because [[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] were still inside. So they changed their plan, and climbed out the third-story window. 

We all met back up (with [[Hugh]] still invisible) and started walking home, when we were diverted by a group of [[Dragon's Hide]] guards. They pointed us down an alley, and although we had a feeling something weird was going on, we followed directions. 

It turns out, [[Limley]] is in the alley, and she's mad. And that's where we left things. Yikes!
