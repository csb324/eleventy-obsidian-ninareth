# Session 150

We went to meet up with [[Zephyra]], who sent us through a stupid little maze of a house. 

Turns out, it wasn't a stupid little maze. It was an [[ELA]] safehouse. Because in the basement, [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] HAS RETURNED.

He was in the [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]], and his cell door *mysteriously* opened one day. [[Niko]], [[Giary]], [[Zephyra]], and [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] were already on their way to help him escape, but boy did someone make it easier. We all coughed nervously about that.

But more importantly, [[Costi]]'s dad is back! Wow!
