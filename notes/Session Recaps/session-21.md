# Session 21: Through the tunnels

We woke up in an [[Underground Safehouse]], after an exhausting day and some sewer travel. [[Hugh]] made breakfast.

[[Zephyra]] acknowledged to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] that she had fucked up, both on purpose and by accident, and promised to make it up to the group. Adrienne accepted this.

[[Kel]] came out -- turns out their name is Kelpi, and they've been in that prison a long ass time. Before that, they were a pirate with [[Salvation Senderson]], someone [[Niko]] knows and likes. 

[[Rosco]] and [[Zephyra]] had a conversation about why [[Zephyra]] left the [[Arazoak]] how she did. Rosco missed her! He asked her to come back, and she said no. She isn't trying to live a life of crime, and she doesn't regret bailing on them - she doesn't expect their loyalty. 

[[Niko]] emerged and found a cache of weapons. Then, he did some explaining. How much explaining? Frankly not much.

His proposition: to take us to [[The Furnace]], a headquarters for the organization of "like minded freedom-inclined people" which he would not specifically name. The way down would be dangerous, and he wanted our help - but also, didn't think we'd make it to the surface without him. So, theoretically, we needed each other. 

We also got a little more of his life story out of him. He was born in [[Deregheir]], to earth genasi parents (who mostly come through the [[Turian Waste]], which has a connection to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]). When he was young, his family was taken to [[Zalev]] and enslaved. When he was old enough to enlist in the military, he did -- and then, post-training, led a slave revolt and killed his unit. He and the others went rogue for a while, which is where he got his reputation as The Hunter (and became an extremely wanted criminal). Then he moved to [[Tinzelven]] and started getting politically involved in [[Arkhosia]]. That's where he linked up with the [[Groups and Organizations/Fire Raisers]]. 

[[Zephyra]] got a bad vibe. She also got a condescending vibe, but we all know that. The more troubling vibe is anger and determination. She shared this with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], who agrees.

The whole group finally got to see the flyer that [[Costi]] had been so defensive about. It says "From the ashes, freedom will rise" with a bunch of flames and a bird (one would assume, a phoenix). Presumably, marketing materials for the [[Groups and Organizations/Fire Raisers]]. 

[[Rez]] and [[Costi]] asked a lot of questions. [[Niko]] told [[Costi]] that [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]'s name did mean something to his organization, and they would probably know more. [[Costi]] finally said out loud to us that his dad was involved in some dangerous stuff with [[ELA]]. 

[[Hugh]] hadn't known that [[Niko]] was helping [[Costi]] with the dad search. They had a tense moment, and [[Hugh]] emphasized to [[Costi]] that he did not want to be lied to. [[Costi]] (and perhaps someone named Tim who isn't in this story) insisted that it was not an intentional lie, more of a memory lapse. But the damage to [[Hugh]]'s trust is done!

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gave [[Niko]] a heads up that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] would be in [[Jalantar]] soon, and she would have to explain her very public kidnapping one way or another, and that this might not be good for him. [[Niko]] did not seem worried about this at all.

We left the bunker and started our journey down through the sewers, into a cave system that predated the city. ([[Rosco]] and [[Kel]] split off to meet up with the rest of our crew -- [[Kara]] and [[Giary]], plus whoever they rescued from the [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar]]) 

We came across an otio and convinced it to leave us alone! Pacifism wins a point. 

Our collective stealth left something to be desired.

A few hours later, we came across a weird light, and followed it to a spooky [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]] with three large stained glass windows, and a long-decayed man chained to an apparatus. As we started to look around, we were attacked by undead creatures. 

And we fought them! [[Niko]] jumped out a window to pursue one. [[Rez]] learned that with a bit of copper she can fuck up someone's spellcasting - a skill that will probably keep coming in handy. [[Hugh]] asked [[TrueSilver]] for some help with the undead and she obliged. [[Freya]] grew a tail. And finally, after we all noticed that the torture-apparatus was the only object undamaged by [[Costi]]'s shattering spell, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was able to disconnect it from its magical energy. The skeleton's eye exploded (there was a lot going on with hands and eyes in the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]]) and the remaining undead creatures fell back into piles of bones.

*Update: March 2025*. The eye explored with a white glimmer.

We looked around and found some things, including a moon shaped rock the [[Shadowfell Shard]] and a strange metal chain [[Magically Resistant Chain]], and then kept moving.

We  only had to walk about half an hour before we reached [[The Furnace]], where [[Niko]] was given a hero's welcome. The people there had heard of us - particularly [[Costi]]. We spoke to a lanky young woman named [[Winifey]] whose job was to keep us busy while they found someone qualified to explain what the hell is going on. 

In our waiting room, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] identified a rock [[Hugh]] found in the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]], and realized it was a [[Shadowfell Shard]] and would be perfect to amp up [[Rez]]'s magic. Also, touching it made her a little sad. But that's probably fine.
