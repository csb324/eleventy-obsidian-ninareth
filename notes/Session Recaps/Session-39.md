# Session 39: The Thronestone problem

At night, we discussed a little and [[Costi]] investigated [[Burru Ilp]]'s notes on the Dragon-grafting. He found at least 11 sets of initials, connecting to people who were involved in either his research or his sourcing.

We talked a little bit about how to handle [[Father Thronestone]], and what to do with [[Burru Ilp]]'s notes. We didn't come to any conclusions.

When the morning came, [[Freya]] had set a trap, and [[Rez]] was gone. [[Costi]] was annoyed that we weren't scolding her for disappearing without saying anything about it. ([[Hugh]] has also noticed that the buddy system seems to apply only to them.) [[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] promised they'd scold her when she got back from wherever she'd gone (probably the [[Seven Hooves]]).

Especially because [[Threthdia Scrivit]] still wants to kidnap us. Speaking of which, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] reached out to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] to set up a meeting that day. [[Henrik]] replied (via rockie-talkie) that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] should bring [[Costi|Constantine]] with her (and could bring the rest), and they would meet in early afternoon at [[Princely Pies]]. 

## Where did [[Rez]] go? 
To meet up with [[Vask]], at [[The Tiamat House]]. She wanted to show it to him, but [[Vask]] doesn't do anything halfway, so, he's already convinced [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] to purchase the house. [[Magister]] was getting the paperwork sorted out as they spoke. 

The plan is to investigate it and eventually demolish it.

In the meantime, [[Rez]] gave [[Vask]] more details on what we found down there. They decided to have their sister handle [[Pleetos Alentas]], because apparently she's already in [[Thelran Asari]]. 

Finally, [[Magister]] helped get the [[Weird Boulder]] up the stairs and onto a cart, so [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] can take it with her. Why? Because [[Vask]] is family and he says [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] is cool and anyway what could possibly go wrong? 

## The rest of the morning errands
[[Freya]] and [[Costi]] went to the [[Burbank FIT]] and I don't remember if anything important happened.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh]] went to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] wanted to ask [[Hugh]] some questions about his experiences with divinity, but realized pretty quickly that his warforged senses and memory loss made it hard to make direct comparisons. At the forge, they met a worshipper named [[Radia Undersford]], who basically told [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] that, yes, sometimes when a god is involved, minorly weird things might happen. This was helpful. She also suggested an interfaith prayer group. I hope she doesn't hold her breath.

Of course, [[Father Thronestone]] was at the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] and wanted to know how things had gone with [[Burru Ilp]]. 

It was a tense conversation. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] made it clear that he had not impressed her with his judgment, and was *extremely* hesitant to tell him anything. [[Hugh]] stood on the opposite end of the spectrum, believing that sometimes good people make mistakes and we shouldn't hold it against him. 

Eventually, [[Hugh]] told [[Father Thronestone]] about [[Pleetos Alentas]] -- and [[Father Thronestone]] intends to contact the temple in [[Thelran Asari]] and get them to reach out to [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]] to track this person down. This is helpful, especially because we didn't know at this point that [[Rez]] and [[Vask]] already had their sister on the case.

[[Father Thronestone]] told us he intended to confess to his order, and he expected to be removed from his post. But he *really* wants to read the notes we retrieved, and says he's the only person who might be able to make sense of them -- and, importantly, see how sophisticated their research was. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked him if he knew of anything untoward going on in any of the other religious orders. [[Father Thronestone]] assumed she meant [[Oghma]]'s followers, rather than [[Bahamut]]'s. She alluded to the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]], but wouldn't say why.

Eventually he got real sick of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s shit in particular.

Regardless, both [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh]] got the sense that [[Father Thronestone]] really was remorseful about *unknowingly empowering a draconic cult* -- the question is: is that enough? 

## We asked that question for a long time.
Everyone got back to [[The Golden Gryffon]], and (as promised) scolded [[Rez]] for disappearing in the morning without so much as a note. She told us that [[Vask]] bought [[The Tiamat House]], and that she thought maybe it would be a good idea to send her sister after [[Pleetos Alentas]]. We mostly responded with "what?" and "no" and "you have a sister?"

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh]] reported what had happened with [[Father Thronestone]], and the whole group talked about it. We all have different angles on this one, but for the most part we agree that he can do more to fix this from a position of power, so we decided to go back to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] after this conversation with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] and tell him not to lose his job on purpose.

## An Interruption
Finally, we started walking to lunch. [[Freya]] noticed that we were being followed -- by someone familiar. We stopped, and were approached by three figures: [[Zephyra]], [[Terrav]], and someone we'd never met before (his name is [[Lance]], and he's a hired mercinary.)

They wanted to talk about the [[Fire Raisers]]. There has been a lot of drama within the [[Fire Raisers]] since the [[Bellisme Show]] attack. It's unclear whether the attack turned violent on purpose, and they are very motivated to find out. [[Winifey|Winnie]] has been questioned (and ruled out), [[Srictha]] still needs to be questioned, and apparently some of the higher-ups suspect [[Niko]] may have been involved. They're tracking him down now, but [[Zephyra]] and [[Terrav]] don't trust... anyone, right now, so they want to find [[Niko]] first. 

So they were hoping we knew where he was. We don't, but [[Freya]] does have something like a lead -- she knows he was in contact with [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] sometime in the last week or two. [[Zephyra]] doesn't think [[Niko]] was involved in the attack getting out of control, but she also thinks he's dreamy, so, who knows

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked [[Terrav]] if he'd keep her posted on anything he heard about [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], especially concerning the [[Arkhosian Elections]]. He said he would!
