# Session 112

Leaving [[Golstrava]], after our daring "escape", we encountered medusas and bullettes. We fought them! One of the medusas got away, which is probably going to come back to bite us later.

[[Jamzik Zodevzo]] eventually found us and escorted us back to the military camp. [[Colvia Ghul]] brought us into an interrogation room with magical lie-detecting wind chimes. She asked [[Freya]] to do the talking. Bold.

We told her "the truth": that we were kidnapped by the [[ELA]] and brought to [[Golstrava]]. We handed over the papers we'd "stolen", and avoided mentioning the way [[Devkorus Kaa|Dev Kaa]] gave [[Costi]] a gentle little kiss on the head. At the end of the conversation, the chimes chimed a little. 

[[Colvia Ghul]] led us to another tent, which was soon revealed to be an exit-less demiplane.
