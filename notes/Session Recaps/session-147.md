# Session 147

We discussed the insane revelations from the previous session, and got more information about [[Rez's Family]]. (For [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]], put "discussed" in air quotes.)

Then we teleported back to the [[Burbanks Chalet]] and talked to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]. She told us that [[Colvia Ghul]] could absolutely have us arrested whenever she felt like doing so, and it would be better if we were not arrested. So, that changes things for us a little.

We did sendings and scryings and [[Finn]] watched [[Vask]] start a bar fight.

For detailed recap, see [[notes-147]]
