# Session 49: Leaving Jalantar

For detailed notes, see [[notes-49]]

**Awkward Loud Party**
* [[Magister]] safely exploded [[The Tiamat House]]
* We met someone named [[Jade]], who knows about [[The Curator]]
* [[Jade]] was delighted to discover that [[Hugh]] was willing to show her his bones, and also that [[Hugh]] doesn't have any bones. This is good data. 
* [[The Miscasts]] performed
* People from around the city thanked us for dealing with the [[The Beauties of Shadow|night hags]], who apparently have been feeding on the sleep of random citizens of [[Jalantar]]
* [[Henrik]], who may have been drinking, let us read [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s obituary, and said [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] would be making a donation someplace in her memory, so we should think of where we might want that to be.

**After the party**
* [[Victor]], [[Ricci Scrucks]], and [[Ellinev Del]] questioned us about our involvement in [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s death, and we said, yeah, we killed her in self defense, and also she was a hag. 
* We promised we'd bring the investigation team the evidence (the [[Bag of Screams]], which is still with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s body) in the morning, and we were released on the condition that we go directly from [[Jalantar]] to [[Arkhosia (City)]]. They'd be waiting for us to check back in when we got there.
* [[Hugh]] invited [[Jade]] to breakfast with us at the [[Goldhide Resort]]

**Overnight**
* [[Niko]], hiding in a bush, reached out to [[Costi]] and confirmed that he has gone somewhat off the deep end.
* [[The Curator]] visited [[Freya]] and they talked about bringing [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back, and about the value of discretion. [[Rez]] tried to be there for the meeting but fell asleep. 

**In the morning**
* [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and [[Magister]] told us more about True Resurrection. The main thing is, it's expensive. We need a *lot* of diamonds, and we need to know someone *very* powerful.
* [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] also told us more about [[Blood Magic]]! Mostly because [[Freya]] gave [[The Curator]] her blood. You gotta keep track of your own blood. 
* [[Magister]] told us more about [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead|The silver hand]], based on what he learned at the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]]. 
* [[Jade]] confronted [[Costi]] about his sex addiction (it turns out, this was a misunderstanding)

**Various errands**
* [[Costi]] and [[Jade]] bought some potions, leveraging [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s death for a discount ([[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] would have fully supported this). They talk warlock-stuff. 
* [[Hugh]] went back to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]], where harp music is *still playing*, to say goodbye to his new little flock. He took a jar of fire from the hearth, which keeps burning. Then he took another one.
* [[Freya]] checked in with the [[Wayfinders]] before leaving the city, and had a heart to heart with [[Akros]]. [[Akros]] warned her about the kinds of things we might encounter between [[Jalantar]] and [[Arkhosia (City)]] â€” Wyverns and Hill Giants.
* [[Rez]] checked in with [[Ghez Yhutl|the baby boy]] at the [[Temple of  Platinum Dragon in Jalantar]]. He has done some excellent research on [[Jorus]], and it turns out he's a natural. He's never felt more alive. (See also: [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]])
* [[Freya]] talked to the historian that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] put her in touch with, and gave only as much information as she felt comfortable giving.
* Everyone met back up at [[Corellon's Grove]], where we coincidentally bumped into [[Lorian]].  

**Grove Grave**
* [[Dawenys]] asked what we wanted to do with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s body, and said [[Henrik]] had already come by looking for it (but also that he didn't push the issue -- she said "no" and he said "okay" and left).
* The deal with True Resurrection is that we either *need* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s body, or the body needs to not exist anymore. So we talked about ways to maybe destroy it.
* [[Dawenys]] suggested the traditional tomb, which basically encourages a tree in the grove to decompose her body over the next six months or so. It's deep underground and seems safe, and we could probably send [[Dawenys]] a message to rush the process if we had to. 
* [[Hugh]] left one of his hearth-fire-jars with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. [[Lorian]] left a harp string. [[Costi]] spoke to the tree in Sylvan. [[Freya]] said goodbye, and [[Rez]] told [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] our group was different now. Finally, [[Jade]] introduced herself and said she was coming with us.
* As the tree roots moved towards her body, they glowed an electric blue.

**The morning we leave**
* [[Costi]] used a new ability to spy on [[The Furnace]], and overheard [[Winifey]] and [[Cinder]] talking about something.
* We made it to [[The Sheath and Sickle]] (we were almost mugged, but [[Hugh]] and [[Jade]] made our attackers reconsider)
* [[Giary]] was tied up in the basement. He explained that *yes he had been hiding [[Niko]]  all along* but [[Niko]] really has lost it, so [[Giary]] tried to stop him from going to [[Arkhosia (City)]]. But instead, he got tied up in his own basement. So now he's on a mission to save his friend.
* We all went to the southern gate, where we found an ostentatious carriage waiting for us.

AND WE'RE OFF!
