# Session 139

We traveled through the [[Turian Waste]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] finally told [[Freya]] that [[Ronan]] and [[Petra]] are married. 

During the night, [[Rez]] found out that her sister [[Zoha]] had been killed, going after [[Bhula Orbnose]]. 

In the morning, we met [[Bek]] and [[Shraule]], two mephits who wanted to hire us to save their boss in the [[Zhakastin Expedition]]. We graciously accepted their offer (and may have called them chickens).

For detailed recap, see [[notes-139]]
