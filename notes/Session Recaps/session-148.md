# Session 148

Back at the [[Burbanks Chalet]], we did some sending, scrying, and strategizing. We talked to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], spied on [[Starstool Daygrip|Starstool]], and saw [[Captain Fretze]] shopping. [[Rez]] and [[Trisha]] shot guns, and we all halfheartedly pretended to be suffering skin slough. 

Later, we revealed much of what we know about [[Freya's Mysterious Letter|Morthos]] to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] and [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] showed [[Costi]] his [[the Matron's Conspiracy|secret basement]].
