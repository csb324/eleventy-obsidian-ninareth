# Session 46: We're in the Fucking Feywild

So, we showed up to [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s house, to [[Threthdia Assassination|kill her]]. Despite our disguises (it's important that we not be seen here), we were welcomed by two members of her personal guard, who are also members of the [[Dragon's Hide]] -- one [[Tobias]], and one [[Zendra]] (whom [[Costi]] recognized as some sort of Fey in disguise). 

They also had two very big, very nice Saint Bernards. 

[[Tobias]] offered us tea, which we had the good sense to not drink. At least, until it was near [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s face, at which point she felt an overwheming compulsion to taste it. Not a great sign.

Eventually, he said dinner was ready, and that [[Threthdia Scrivit]] would meet us in the garden. 

## It was not a garden.

We walked through a doorway, and *whoops, joke's on us, this is [[the Feywild]]*. As in, the place [[Rez]]'s riddles come from.

We were initially dropped into a pit of quicksand. [[Hugh]] got out right away, and he and [[Freya]] used a rope to help pull the rest of us out. (One assumes this must be covered in Wayfinder training). 

> "Let's hang ourselves from a net and act like we got trapped!"
> "Okay, what's the next step of that plan?"
> *"We can talk about that in the net!"*

Eventually we made our way to a forest, avoiding more quicksand and vines that do not want to be cut.

As we adjusted to our new *plane of reality*, we noticed a couple things. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s [[Larethian Rose]] is glowing, and [[Samuel]] doesn't want to be here. Worth keeping in mind.

We walked through the woods for a while, until we came to a series of ponds and islands (how does this work? Land bridges). That's where we heard the howling of dogs. Not big fluffy helpful saint bernards, but a terrible man-bat-dog-face thing. [[Zendra]] was there too. Turns out, she's a Summer Eladrin, a fey creature made of metal and good with weapons.

## Combat ensued

[[Zendra]] thought she could scare us (and she was a little bit right). [[Rez]] ran into one of the ponds, where she met fish with long grabby arms. [[Hugh]] collected the [[Group Inventory|pelts of the Yeathhounds]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] cut a dog's face off. [[Costi]] imagined some mean little critters. [[Freya]] grew a tail! 

The nice thing about the woods here is that they seem to know where we should go next. Are we walking directly into a trap? Probably. But it sure saves us time trying to navigate.

Speaking of navigating, the next thing we came across was a *maze*. After trying to find ways around it (and failing, and getting punched by a bush), we let [[Freya]]'s navigation skills, [[Costi]]'s intelligence, and [[Rez]]'s enthusiasm for [[the Feywild]]'s pranks lead the way. This maze *loved* [[Rez]], in particular -- so much that it led us to a willow tree where time seemed to stop. Finally, a place we felt like we could safely rest.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] took the opportunity to play the harp and try to connect with [[Corellon Larethian]]. Four more [[Larethian Rose]]s grew at her feet. 

Meanwhile, [[Costi]] talked to the tree in Sylvan. ([[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] also talked to the tree). It's surprising that this worked. The willow tree is not friends with the maze, but did like us. It couldn't answer all of our questions (it is a tree) but it did point us in the direction of [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s garden. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] let the tree keep the roses. 

Finally, we made it to the garden... where [[The Beauties of Shadow]] are waiting for us.
