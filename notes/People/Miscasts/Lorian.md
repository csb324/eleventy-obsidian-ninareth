The pan flute player of [[The Miscasts]], who blushes a little more when [[Rez]] is around. He's on the shy side, but if you get him drunk he will take off his shirt, per [[Jenson Davour|Jenson]]. 

He worships [[Corellon Larethian]], and told [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] a bit more about the [[Larethian Rose]]. His parents are also worshippers, and he seems to have a bit of divine magic.

### Background
Grew up in a small town in the [[Liveth forest]] in [[Dilandil]], his mother was a tree shaper

### Who's he to us?
Had a fling with [[Rez]]
Introduced [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to [[Dawenys]] (who he also had fling with!)
