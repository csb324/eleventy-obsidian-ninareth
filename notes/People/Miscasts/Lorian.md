The pan flute player of [[The Miscasts]], who blushes a little more when [[Rez]] is around. He's on the shy side, but if you get him drunk he will take off his shirt, per [[Jenson Davour|Jenson]]. 

He worships [[Corellon Larethian]], and told [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] a bit more about the [[Larethian Rose]].
