# Fig

[Status::alive]
[Race::Half-Elf]
[Relationship::friend]
[Affiliation::[[Church of Corellon Larethian]]]
[Home::[[Temple of Corellon Outside Quaath]]]

>Fig was a half-elf as well, which might be why Adrienne listened to her. She looked older than she acted. Her long gray hair was pulled back into a wild bun.

Took care of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] when she got sick on the road to [[Demphinster]]. Seems like a nice lady.
