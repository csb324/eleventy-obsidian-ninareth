> Fig looked unreservedly sad to see her go; Bevin looked a mixture of sad, relieved, and vindicated. She got the feeling Bevin wanted to like her, but didn’t. She got the feeling Fig actually did. She genuinely liked both of them. They’d been kind to her for no reason at all. That was a weird thing to do! But she was starting to think, maybe it wasn’t weird? Maybe that was always an option?
