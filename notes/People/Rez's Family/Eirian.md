### Background
[[Rez]] and [[Vask]]'s sister.

### Who're They to Us?
[[Rez]] asked [[Vask]] if he knew of any parts of [[Rez's Family]] in [[Thelran Asari]] - he thought [[Eirian]] was. So [[Rez]] used the [[Circlet of Sending]] to ask her help stopping [[Burru Ilp]] before he spread information on [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]]. [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] was unhappy on with [[Rez]], but hey [[Eirian]] said she'd help! 

Working with [[Ghez Yhutl]] to track down [[Pleetos Alentas]] on [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]]
