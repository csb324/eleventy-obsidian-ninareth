She's a friendly, talkative wayfinder.

Traveled with [[Rez]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and [[Innis]] to [[Tinzelven]], and tangled with the [[Vrolbekk Pixies]]. After waiting a couple days at the [[The Thrusting Trumpet]], she was called back to [[Jalantar]] on Wayfinder business, right before the [[Gruung Attack on Tinzelven]]. Innis is traveling there with her.
