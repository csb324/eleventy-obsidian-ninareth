# Silvia VonPyremark

[Status::unknown]
[Race::Gnome]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Alma Mater::[[Redscale]]]

A classmate of Adrienne's at [[Redscale]].

-   Adrienne’s opinion: complicated  
-   Silvia was also unpopular -- her dad was a literature instructor and he was a hardass, so a lot of kids had heard that [[Professor VonPyremark]] sucked and would blame her for it.    
-   And she didn’t help her own case -- she was a big nerd. Very little self awareness. Or, perhaps, a lot of self awareness but she just didn’t want the approval of her peers.    
-   (this baffled and annoyed Adrienne -- seeing someone who COULD fit in if she had TRIED, except instead she’s cheerfully doing weird stuff all the time, seemingly oblivious to what people will think)    
-   That said, she and Adrienne were both at the bottom of the social ladder, so they spent a lot of time together. Whenever people had to pair up for assignments, they’d usually end up working together.  
-   Silvia might consider Adrienne a friend.
-   Adrienne would consider them former classmates.
