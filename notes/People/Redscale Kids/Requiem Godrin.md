# Requiem Godrin

[Status::unknown]
[Race::Human]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Alma Mater::[[Redscale]]]

```ad-spoiler-a


[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s first roommate at [[Redscale]] academy.

-   She was initially _okay_ to Adrienne (because she was ten), but about halfway through first year, she changed her mind. Because she was ten.
-   Adrienne observed her a lot though -- throughout all ten years at Redscale. Just by virtue of being the first one of these kids Adrienne had ever interacted with up close, she became the example of how Redscale Kids handled things.
-   Like, if she wasn’t sure what to eat in the cafeteria, she’d get in the back of the line and watch what everyone else got, but especially Requiem.
-   The main things Adrienne learned from this set of interactions was “don’t let people find out too much about you because they will eventually make fun of you for it” and “it is very hard to undo a bad first impression”
