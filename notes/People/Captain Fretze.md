A tall olive skinned human, with dark braid running halfway down his back.

When we met, he was a captain in the [[Zalevi Military]] who was passing through [[Tinzelven]] during the [[Gruung Attack on Tinzelven]] and stopped to kill some frogs. He's a friend of [[Deeksta]] and [[Victor]], although he and [[Victor]] have been on different sides of wars. 

[[Niko]] said to avoid him, and if we *must* interact, definitely do not mention [[Niko]].

It turns out, that's because he's a Slavecatcher in the [[Zalevi Military]], and [[Niko]] was specifically wanted for *freeing* slaves in [[Zalev]]. He's significantly more dangerous and more powerful than we originally believed. But he's unerringly friendly to [[Our Party]], and regards us as fun little curiosities. He's an extrovert. And he loves his (fucked up, violent, human-rights-violating) country. 

He's married. He likes horses and he also eats horses and in [[Zalev]] this is normal. He seems like a supportive manager. I cannot emphasize enough that he is an evil man.
