A captain in the [[Zalevi Military]] who was passing through [[Tinzelven]] during the [[Gruung Attack on Tinzelven]] and stopped to kill some frogs. He's a friend of [[Deeksta]] and [[Victor]], although he and [[Victor]] have been on different sides of wars. Seems to have a pretty chill outlook, with regard to the human costs of war.
