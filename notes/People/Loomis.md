The head porter at [[The Golden Gryffon]]. 

Seems appropriately skeptical of us, a group of weirdos who look like shit and say our room is paid for by [[Willen Guruden]]. 

Is quite empathetic to our buddy [[Hugh]], whose social skills keep putting him in situations that are probably a new one for poor Loomis.
