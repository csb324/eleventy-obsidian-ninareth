Dragonborn with longish ears, in purple robes.

The owner and bartender of [[Seven Hooves]]. Took over managing around 12 years ago.

Outranked [[Lish]] in [[The Stagehands]]. Told us that if we're going to do anything illegal in the city, we should probably run it by him to make sure we're not stepping in anyone else's business. [[The Stagehands]] might want a cut, but they're not going to cause problems for us besides the problems they've already caused.

He likes turkey club sandwiches, and he thinks [[Hugh]] is wonderful.
