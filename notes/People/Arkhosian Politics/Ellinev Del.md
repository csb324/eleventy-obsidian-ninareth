Younger middle aged, tall half-elven woman. Pale with dark brown hair normally worn in a messy bun with her googles kept on her head and spectacles in her pocket. Wears a stained smock, and carries fine tools.

Has been vocally leading the response to the recent [[Jalantar]] [[The Providers]] headquarters [[Mysterious Explosions|bombing]]. Says they are part of a larger pattern, and informed us of a new one at the personal residence of [[The Guardians]] Delegate Mufastel. Is suspicous because the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]] bombing did not fit the pattern: non-Jalantar related, non-political party, and the only one where people were harmed. 

Appears to be an artificer, says that all of her work is funded by and done on the behest of the [[Jalantar]] government. 

Knows about warforged, and seemed to guess the [[Hugh]] had memory problems when he mentioned that he was from [[Eberron]]. Said she's worked on reverse engineering experiments in the past. Says most warforged are only used as tools of violence, and that when their purpose is served they are often coming to consciousness (seen as a bad thing). Says fixing his memory would need to be done by an eberronian master artificer. Warns us to be careful on how we expose Hugh to [[Holy Maker Stormswallow]]

### Background
Served with [[Victor]] for some time in the [[Arkhosian Military]].  

Went to the [[The Slavaadi College]] and worked on her artificery there, but was asked to leave for her vocal opposition to slavery. 

### Who're they to us? 
An [[Arkhosian Delegates|Arkhosian delegate]] that [[Victor]] wants to introduce to [[Costi]].
Offered to talk more to [[Costi]] 

Sent us a note in [[session-27]]
	To [[Jalantar]]'s most exciting recent arrivals, if you are available later today I would appreciate speaking with you about your experience at the [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar]] during the recent attacks. The committee to investigate acts of terror would surely benefit from your testimony. If you are free, come to [[Gorva's Observatory]] anytime and I will clear my schedule. Looking forward to meeting you, Delegate Elenev Del

[[session-29]] Costi told her that he was searching for [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]]. She said she'd make some inquiries on his behalf. 

Invited [[The Unforged Few]] to some [[The Providers]] meeting in the lead up to [[Arkhosian Elections]]. It won't be as lit as [[session-7|the last one]].

Went to the [[Bellisme Show]] and connected with [[The Unforged Few]] and [[Victor]] - he's going to speak to the Committee (at least those that aren't arrested)
