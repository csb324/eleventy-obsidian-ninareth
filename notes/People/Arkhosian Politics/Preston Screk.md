[Location::

20ish human male with blonde hair, four piece green suit.

Works for underswell, started nine months ago. Outwardly idolizes him, secretly seems to despise him. Aspires to be a delegate in a short number of years. 

### Who're they to us? 
Escorted [[Adrienne Spout]], [[Costi]], and [[Freya]] to meet with [[Vigo Underswell]]. Very excited to meet us. Wants to see [[Rez]]â€™s scales. Offers [[The Unforged Few]] a tour after the meeting.
