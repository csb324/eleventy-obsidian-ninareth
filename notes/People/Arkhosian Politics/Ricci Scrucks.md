[Workplace: [[Central Administrative Cluster]]]

Blue dragonborn in fine hidesman armor, has a pendant to bahamant around his neck, with a longsword. A very large man. 

Head of the [[Dragon's Hide]] , [[The Guardians]] delegate. 

Had been vocally leading the response to the recent [[Jalantar]] [[The Providers]] headquarters bombing. But, led authorities to think the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]] bombing was unrelated.

He has a cousin, [[Del Scrucks]] who is a [[The Providers]] delegate. Their family is very connected.

Old friends with [[Relakas]]. Or, was.

Original co-founder (with [[Victor]]) of the [[Fire Raisers]]. They served together in the [[4th Regiment]], and wanted to make Arkhosia a better place. Assassinated in the [[Election Day Attack]].

### Who're they to us? 
Introduced themselves to [[The Unforged Few]] at the [[Bellisme Show]]. Offered us work as consultants for the [[Dragon's Hide]] 

Is thinking about redoing his forier and wants [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to tell [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] he could use a consult. 

Joined us in fighting the Ash monsters at the [[Bellisme Show]].

Came to read us out after the fight. Mentioned tracking down everyone we fought with, but didn't recognize [[Winifey|Winnie]]. Asked us if we knew her or saw where she went. We said she disappeared and avoided mentioning we knew here. Thanked us and shared that the [[the Mayor of Jalantar]] is hosting an event to thank those that fought, asked us to attend along with the [[The Silver Halves]]. [[Captain Fretze]] and [[Victor]] held a door and are also being recognized. He seems to think there's a chance we're holding something back.
