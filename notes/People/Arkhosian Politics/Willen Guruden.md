Pronounced *gu ru DEN*

### Background 
He owns most of [[Tinzelven]]. Or, at least half.  A known military fellow. 

His sister [[Quillette Guruden]] is on [[The Circle]]

He started calling himself "Captain" and the [[Tinzelven Town Guard]] was like, "sure." Wears an untouched breastplate with an elaborate G on it, and carrys a gorgeous longsword

Very formal type of fellow. He will correct your posture. He did it to [[Korvae]]. 

### Who's he to us?  
He's friendly, to our faces. 

Something killed his yaks and he hired us to look into it. It turns out, the yaks had been killed by bear-riding [[Gruung]] in the [[Vrolbekk Forest]] next to his house. We killed the Gruung and extracted information from the last one (that the Gruung are preparing an attack on the town the next morning). He invited us to lunch, where we talked about politics.

Currently owes [[Hugh]] and [[Rez]] favors.
