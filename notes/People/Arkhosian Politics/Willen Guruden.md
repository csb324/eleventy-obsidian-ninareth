# Willen Guruden

[Status::alive]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Race::Dragonborn]
[Affiliation::[[The Guardians]]]
[Affiliation::[[Tinzelven Town Guard]]]
[Home::[[Tinzelven]]]
[Location::[[Guruden Estate]]]

He owns most of [[Tinzelven]]. Or, at least half. Plus, his sister [[Quillette Guruden]] is on [[The Circle]], so, he's an important guy. He started calling himself "Captain" and the [[Tinzelven Town Guard]] was like, "sure."

Very formal type of fellow. He will correct your posture. He did it to [[kevin]].


[[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] once attended a party at his mansion, and brought [[Adrienne Spout]] to play the harp.

Something killed his yaks and he has hired us to look into it.
