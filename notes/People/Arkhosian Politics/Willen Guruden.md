He owns most of [[Tinzelven]]. Or, at least half. Plus, his sister [[Quillette Guruden]] is on [[The Circle]], so, he's an important guy. He started calling himself "Captain" and the [[Tinzelven Town Guard]] was like, "sure."

Very formal type of fellow. He will correct your posture. He did it to [[kevin]].


[[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] once attended a party at his mansion, and brought [[Adrienne Spout]] to play the harp.
