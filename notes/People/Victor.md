# Victor

[Status::alive]
[Race::Human]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Tinzelven]]]
[Workplace::[[Needley store or someshit]]]

He's the clothes guy. Friends with [[Bliken Hammerov]]. Vaguely racist against [[Hugh]].

Told [[Costi]] that [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] is a solid dude and not a moustache-twirling villain. So that's good.
