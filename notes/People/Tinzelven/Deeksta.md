De facto Captain of the [[Tinzelven Town Guard]] Likes to play cards. Says Rez is trouble.

The [[Willen Guruden|captain]] once told her, "find someone who does your job better than you do, and then listen to what they say". She's that someone. 

Seems like a straight shooter. Knows how to do her job. 

Does not want to talk about politics, but is a voting member and supports [[The Guardians]] on behalf of [[Guruden Estate]]'s support of [[Tinzelven]]. 

### Who're They to Us?
Friends with [[Niko]]

Slept with [[Rez]]

Slept with [[Niko]], we assume

Isn't super fond of [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] and all his rogue robot bullshit.

[[Deeksta]] chat with [[Rez]] about [[Niko]] again. After some persuasion, she opens up. Says he always claimed to hide in plain sight - thinks we should check [[Jalantar]]. They talk politics some, Deeksta asks Rez to help keep Niko on the right side of things. Claims he has a good heart, but seemed excited - like things may be starting on up. She worries things are going to get much more dangerous around here.
