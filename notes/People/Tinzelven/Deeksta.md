De facto Captain of the [[Tinzelven Town Guard]] Likes to play cards. Says Rez is trouble.

Friends with [[Niko]]
Slept with [[Rez]]
Slept with [[Niko]], we assume
Isn't super fond of [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] and all his rogue robot bullshit.

The [[Willen Guruden|captain]] once told her, "find someone who does your job better than you do, and then listen to what they say". She's that someone. 

Seems like a straight shooter. Knows how to do her job. 

Does not want to talk about politics.
