Interests: Interplanar stuff
Trying to build a way to make a whole lot of money, using an emerald we almost stole from him (The thrice-traveled emerald)

Nonetheless, seems to like us enough.

Employs [[Niko]]
Father of [[Gora Klipitz]]

Old science friend and also lost lover: [[Hanna Dimbleswelter]]

He keeps building these robots that absolutely do not work and are 1000% more dangerous than they need to be. 

- [ ] wait for his machine to backfire which it definitely will.
