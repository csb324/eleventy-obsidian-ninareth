Interests: Interplanar stuff
Trying to build a way to make a whole lot of money, using an emerald we almost stole from him (The thrice-traveled emerald)

Nonetheless, seems to like us enough.

Employs [[Niko]]
Father of [[Gora Klipitz]]

Old science friend and also lost lover: [[Hanna Dimbleswelter]]

He keeps building these robots that absolutely do not work and are 1000% more dangerous than they need to be. 

He gave us gemstones! They may or may not be real, but he sent [[Niko]] with us to [[Jalantar]] to find out. Either way, we can keep them.
([[session-16]]: they're real)

Has a new assitant [[Winston]]

### Inventions
[[dimensional anchor]]: 4 in long black metal spike covered in runes: use it to be sure that when youâ€™re interacting with items changes dimensions or time, that things stay in place

Ionized Leather Sack: describes it as helpful in transplanar travel

Plane of Earth Auto-mine

Earth plane diamond energy magnifier

### Who're They to Us?

Gave [[Rez]] Riddle-machine

Came across [[Freya]]'s symbol while researching his rock bag, it's in the margins "The Unnatural Naturality: A history of the creation of the prime material plane and an examiniation of it's relationship with the elemental, outer, and mirror planes by T.Y. Gurscock" in 1753 - got in a used bookstore in [[Arkhosia (City)]] at [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]] about 40 years ago. 

Offered to help procure diamonds for us to [[Resurrect Adrienne]], if we can pay
