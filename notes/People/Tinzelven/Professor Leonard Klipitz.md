Interests: Interplanar stuff
Trying to build a way to make a whole lot of money, using an emerald we almost stole from him (The thrice-traveled emerald)

Nonetheless, seems to like us enough.

Employs [[Niko]]
Father of [[Gora Klipitz]]

Old science friend and also lost lover: [[Hanna Dimbleswelter]]

He keeps building these robots that absolutely do not work and are 1000% more dangerous than they need to be. 

He gave us gemstones! They may or may not be real, but he sent [[Niko]] with us to [[Jalantar]] to find out. Either way, we can keep them.
