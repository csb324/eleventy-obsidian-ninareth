Friends with [[Bliken Hammerov]]. Vaguely racist against [[Hugh]]. Seems less based in race hate, more based in war trauma.

Vouched for [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] when [[Costi]] went looking for dirt on him.

He's an [[Arkhosian Delegates|Arkhosian delegate]], not from [[Tinzelven]] but from [[Arkhosia (City)]]. Currently serving as an Overseer in [[Jalantar]], filling [[Vigo Underswell]]'s seat. 

### Background
Commanded the [[Arkhosian Military]] Fourth Regiment, as a military detective, was one of the most influential leaders and very skilled with a bow. He was a "great warrior," according to [[Willen Guruden]]. (Otherwise, they don't seem to like each other much.)

### Who's He To Us?
He's taken a liking to [[Costi]], who reminds him of himself at a young age. Victor gave [[Costi]] a pair of magical gloves, that should help him be quick with his hands. He wants to bring [[Costi]] to see the elections when that rolls around. 

Saw him at the [[Bellisme Show]], he gave us a good background on the event. He fought in the attack with [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]]. [[Ellinev Del]] asked him to stay in [[Jalantar]] for a few weeks to help out.

We connected him with [[Neiragneg|Neir]], who we think should work with [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]. He's happy to help.

Is helping [[Ellinev Del]] and [[Ricci Scrucks]] investigate the [[Fire Raisers]] attack at the [[Bellisme Show]]. Says he doesn't agree with Scrucks' politics but things he's dedicated and insightful.

Sent a note to help to share that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] died and we were not attending the [[the Mayor of Jalantar]]'s awards ceremony
