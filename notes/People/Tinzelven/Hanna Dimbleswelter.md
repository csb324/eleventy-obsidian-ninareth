[Home::Outside [[Tinzelven]]]

We went to her house and took the thrice-traveled emerald she'd promised to [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]. We also took some other gems, and a machine that prints riddles. 

### her note to [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]
> “Well, well, well, look who showed up. You think I’m going to keep putting my butt on the line for this thing, over and over? After what you said to me? What kind of risks are you taking, huh? And when am I getting PAID?! No, Len, you can take your apologies and shove it. I’m keeping the gem. And obviously I know you aren’t here personally and probably sent [[Niko]] or some other people. I apologize for the tone of this message.”'

So. that's something. 

### Underground Lab
It had monsters! Mimics and Meephits.
