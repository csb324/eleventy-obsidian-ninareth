![](/assets/obsidian/Niko%20Crop.jpg)

An Earth genasi with tall granite gray skin with an opaque complexion, flecks of emerald and ruby dust dotting their skin, with a long black braid.

### Background

Works for [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] as a miscellaneous combat-capable assistant. Treasurer for [[The Providers]] in Tinzelven. [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] paid him in land, so now he's a voter in Arkhosia, which is something he takes seriously. 

Has a good friend “Uru” , a large 12 point elk, and a good friend in [[Jalantar]] named [[Giary]]

### Past Lives

Born in [[Deregheir]], he and his family were taken to [[Zalev]] and enslaved when he was young. When he was old enough, he joined the [[Zalevi Military]] just long enough to get combat training, then killed his unit (with the other enslaved soldiers). 

He became a notorious criminal - but the crime was freeing slaves. He was known as The Hunter. Then he moved to [[Tinzelven]] and started getting politically involved in [[Arkhosia]]. That's where he linked up with the [[Groups and Organizations/Fire Raisers]]. 

### Who's he to us? 
Friends with [[Deeksta]]
Slept with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]
Manipluating/mentoring [[Costi]]

Traveled to [[Jalantar]] with [[The Unforged Few]], to get our gems appraised for Klipitz. Staying with friend and miscreant [[Giary]] 

Has a working knowledge of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s efforts, but claims he wouldn't be known by him - mistrusts [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] becuase of it. 

Introduced us to his "associates" in the [[Fire Raisers]] at their secret headquartes [[The Furnace]]

Told [[Deeksta]], he always claimed to hide in plain sight, thinks we should check [[Jalantar]]. Claims he has a good heart, but seemed excited - like things may be starting on up. She worries things are going to get much more dangerous around here.
