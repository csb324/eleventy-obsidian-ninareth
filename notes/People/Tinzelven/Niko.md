An Earth genasi with tall granite gray skin with an opaque complexion, flecks of emerald and ruby dust dotting their skin, with a long black braid.

Works for [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] as a miscellaneous combat-capable assistant.

Has a good friend “Uru” , a large 12 point elk.

Friends with [[Deeksta]]
Slept with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]

He's on his way to [[Jalantar]] with us, to get our gems appraised for Klipitz. 

He knows more than he lets on -- he's a voter, and engaged with [[The Providers]] in Tinzelven. [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] paid him in land, so now he's a voter in Arkhosia, which is something he takes seriously. He also knows *of* [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], more than [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] expected.

#### Known aliases
- Mr. Business [[session-7]]
