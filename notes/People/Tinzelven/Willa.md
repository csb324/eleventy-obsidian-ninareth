A member of the [[Tinzelven Town Guard]], with healing abilities. [[Hugh]] saved her life after the [[Gruung Attack on Tinzelven]].  

It turns out, she's a [[The Wayward Wardens|Warden]], and serves [[Yondala]]. She's meant to travel the continent, but settled down in [[Tinzelven]]. We told her we wouldn't blow her cover.
