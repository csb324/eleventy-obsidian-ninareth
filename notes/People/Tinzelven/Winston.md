Burly halfing, assistant to [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], used to work for him "before". 

### Background
Wanted to pursue his dream of owning a bakery in [[Arkhosia (City)]].

Asked him if he knew what [[Niko]] has gone, and after chatting with us agreed to let him know we were trying to look for him. 

Learned most of what he knows about politics from [[Victor]], says he was a part of this 4th regiment which had the least casualities of the war. 

### Who're They to Us?
Told us that [[Giary]] used to have a floral themed bar, before the [[The Sheath and Sickle]].
