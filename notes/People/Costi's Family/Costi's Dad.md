Father to [[Costi]] and [[Nadia]].
Married to [[Costi's mom]]

Met and befriended [[Hugh]] in the [[Eberronian Military]]

Told Costi, "Protect the family near Glendan Glade, find the stone and kiss it for me, hold the blade"

## Background
Is a member of [[ELA]], the Eberronian Liberation Association, a secret society that he spied for. Thought to be last seen or had a contact with people in [[Jalantar]]? 

Also a member of the [[Eberronian Military]].

## Clues
[[Hugh]] has a patch he believes is from Vlad’s outfit that reads “Vladimir Grosu, corporal, [[Beating Heart Regiment]]”. This battalion of the [[Eberronian Military]] was well-known historically for a distaste of non-living humans. Seems like they push back strongly against use of any “non-souled creatures”, like Vampires but also maybe war-forged in more modern cases.

Memory from [[Hugh]] upon killing [[Jecka]]
	Hugh finds himself on a bloody battlefield. Sees Vlad standing back looking aghast, as a large hulking man with pointed ears, monstrous teeth, and a two handed warhammer pushes him to the ground and say “we don’t retreat”

[[Cinder]] mention that somone at [[The Furnace]] says he remembers a Grosu out in the [[Bihor Region]] region of [[Eberron]] about a year and a half ago. The [[Fire Raisers]] can give us more information. [[Niko]] has offered to help find more information as well. 

[[Giary]] has [[The Stagehands]] looking for information.

## Known Aliases
