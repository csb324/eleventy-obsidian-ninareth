Large human woman, heavily muscled, nearing middle age. Short cropped hair, shaved on the sides. Seemed to have the natural inclination of a bully, though is not overt.

Wears the black and green armor of the hired guards with an orange and black tree insignia with a green leaf in the shape of a P rising from the top. 

### Background
Used to be part of the [[Dragon's Hide]]

### Who's she to us? 
Gave [[Rez]] (Amy) and [[Freya]] (Courtney) a tour of [[Pent Logging|Pent North]] when they told her they were looking for work there. She was the closest to suspicious about our real identities. 

[[Rez]] lied about being sent by her as a courier to [[Norathar Pent]]'s office. Several guards seemed overjoyed by this fuck up, and it feels as though a plot will ensue.  

Lost their job at [[Pent Logging]] from the fall out of [[Operation Incriminating Letters]] and [[Rez]] being caught by guards. 

Uh-oh, appears to have worked with the [[Dragon's Hide]] to corner [[The Unforged Few]] for what can only be bad intent. Jumped us with "hello Amy". Wasn't her best choice, we killed her. 

### Items
133 GP
key to a storage room where [[The Unforged Few]] was attacked
