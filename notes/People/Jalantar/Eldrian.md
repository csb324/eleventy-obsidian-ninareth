"Actor", very short gnome who relies heavily on pomp and cirucmstance.

Clearly has a drinking problem, in desperate need of work. 

### Who Is He to Us?
Hired by [[Rez]] - 7 cp a day. Bringing colleagues for an additional 1 cp per day per colleague. Thinks comedy is the lesser art form, so that's a strike.
