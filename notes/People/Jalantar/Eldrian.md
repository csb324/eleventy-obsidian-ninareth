"Actor", very short gnome who relies heavily on pomp and cirucmstance. Long of torso, short of leg. Nicknmaed "El"

Clearly has a drinking problem, in desperate need of work. 

### Background
Has been a "working actor" in [[Jalantar]] for 73 years

### Who Is He to Us?
Hired by [[Rez]] - 7 cp a day. Bringing colleagues for an additional 1 cp per day per colleague. Thinks comedy is the lesser art form, so that's a strike.

Brought colleagues Heidi, curly hair red head, seems quite shy and Luke AKA Free Rider a very large man (eating scrambled eggs)
