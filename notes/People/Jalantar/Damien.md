Navy skinned elf, gray haired, stout man. He holds a crossbow on one hand and a white pipe in the other. 


### Background
A former employee of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s has been living in one of his properties. years ago, his gambling debts transferred his property to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. He's recently acquired an item that he wants -- if he parts with it Julian will forgive a significant portion of his debts and continue living in his house. If he doesn't he will need to leave, and pay Julian what he owes. The item is an instrument, a pipe -- fancy and magic, but doesn't want to tell us the details. 

At one point was a rather impressive musician, but hasn't been active for years and is now an elderly recluse. Named Damien 

[[Deeksta]] says he keeps to himself - said his home used to be cemetary keeper's. Comes in town every few months, and everyone dislikes it. Oh, and it might be haunted. We said we're talking to him for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], with all that implies. Likes screech strings, and thinks his taste in music is much better than anyone else's. 


### Who're They to Us?
[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] wants us to retrieve the pipe and collect on his debts. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] leads that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] wants his property back. He claims he's paid his dues, and Adrienne asks for documentation - it seems to back up what he's saying. Total debt 893 GP, he's paid the minimum interest for the last several years, but it's been growing sharply. Says [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] can't have the flute, seems to know the deal on working with him. 
	She asks how he stopped working for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], he says there's no stopping working for him. You can't stop him, the worlds built for him. Seems to read Adrienne's feelings on Julian shockingly well

Decides to move off [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s property rather than surrender his pipe. Raises the skeletons and zombies in the graveyard, and brings them with him. A few of them give us some of the jewlery they are buried with to help pay down his debt. One, with a special brooch in particular. They head north, off into their proverbial sunset.
