A human young man, approaching 30 with a bit of a limp dark tan skin and dark hair. Appears to be from southern [[Eberron]]. 

### Background
Says he'd recongize a Grosu anywhere, was in the army and deserted. Found some ELA folks, and about 5 years ago [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] came through and helped trained the encampent there. Struck a friendship, they corresponded for a while. Used to return every 3 or 4 months. Eventually helped teach espionage skills. Camp was raided around two years ago, they all scattered. Is still in touch with him. 

It's been a few months, but about four months ago he got a response to a letter. Ferried by the [[ELA]] confirmed his identity through a codename and said he was in [[Eberron]]

[[Terrav]], who says he knows [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] and has been corresponding with him regularly. They last he heard from [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] was four months ago, and [[Freya]] picked up that perhaps [[Terrav]] wasn't telling us everything. He didn't seem to be lying, but he did seem to be trying not to worry us, in a situation that may be indeed worrying. Point is, we have more evidence that [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] is alive.

### Who Is He to Us?
Met through the [[Fire Raisers]] after [[Operation Incriminating Letters]]

Says he'll use to reach out on behalf of [[Costi]] in his next letter. 
	"mom and sis are okay, and I'm out finding an outlet for that passion. I, if he needs anything from me, or if I can help in anyway, please tell me. I want to help. I'll keep making him proud"

[[Freya]] seemed to get a bit of a read on him
