A cleric at the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. He's teaching [[Rez]] how to pour iron, as she works off her debt for her face-repairs. He gave her his first successfully-made dagger, to inspire her.

He's also very interested in how the five-cup shuffle game at [[Seven Hooves]] works, so the two of them are also working on that puzzle.

Asked him to make us a replica ring, for [[Operation Incriminating Letters]] and told him it was for [[Rez]]
