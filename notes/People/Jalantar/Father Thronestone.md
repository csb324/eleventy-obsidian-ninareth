The leader of the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. He has a long gnarled gray beard, and wears a long chain. 

### Who's he to us?
He was able to heal [[Hugh]] and [[Rez]] after the [[Zephyra Affair]]. Grafted new silver dragon scales onto [[Rez]], and allowed her to pay off the price of the scales by learning to forge.

Offered to dispose the [[Bag of Screams]] for a donation, we gave him the [[Summoning Stone]] to power part of the hearth, paid us for it. 

Wanted to check in if [[Rez]] has any lingering symtpoms from her silver dragon scale being melded onto her face, like aggressive, itchy, sore or highly possesive of things.

Experimented with dragon scales and [[Burru Ilp]], got in over his head. Asked [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] to check-in on it. Very guilty afterwards, plans to report himself to the council at the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] to try and capture [[Pleetos Alentas]]. Gave us a tattoo of claw, a whistle of fly, and 300gp
