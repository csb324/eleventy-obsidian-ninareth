The leader of the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. He has a long gnarled gray beard, and wears a long chain. 

### Who's he to us?

He was able to heal [[Hugh]] and [[Rez]] after the [[Zephyra Affair]]. Grafted new silver dragon scales onto [[Rez]], and allowed her to pay off the price of the scales by learning to forge.

Offered to dispose the [[Bag of Screams]] for a donation
