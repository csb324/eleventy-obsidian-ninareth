Burly wood elf.

An officer in the [[Eberronian Military]]

### Background


### Who're they to us? 
An old friend of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], says he's working with him to get a statue of the Prince of Purse from the first sundering to decorate his barracks. Has worked with [[Sienna Burbank]] too.

Friendly with [[El'Haliand]], [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]]

Asked [[Hugh]] what his designation was as a soldier, and made a reference to his ability to be in [[Jalantar]] legally

Recognized [[Costi]]'s name, and knew [[Costi's mom]] was an instructor at [[AVAD]]. Asked him to put in a good word for his daughter next time they talk, her name is Cynthia.  

Died in the [[Bellisme Show]] aftermath.
