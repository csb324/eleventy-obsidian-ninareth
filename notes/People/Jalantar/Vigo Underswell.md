Older halfling, pretty tall relatively, at about 3.5ft, with well coiffed and stiff white hair, white mutton chops and deeply tanned skin. Green suit, with a pink button flower. Very stately air. Very focused on his family, the most typical politician weâ€™ve seen so far. 

[[The Guardians]] delegate, operates out of the southern end of the Publics, in the Southern Publics Administrative Cluster. One of the three Overseers of the Publics. Fastidious and cares deeply about appearances, likes to put on a big show. Employs [[Preston Screk]] as his clerk. 

His office, large desk with three nice windows towards the back. Behind his desk there are glasses in shelves with Knick knacks on them, along all the walls are portraits of unsmiling halflings, seem to look similar. A few bookshelves between the windows and a couch opposite the desk. Located where most officials in the southern public works, mostly financial folks.

Big drawer on bottom left that is magic, with something inside but none on the drawer with the potion. Everything here has the appearance of being super fancy but is all very cheap. Drawer has four gold bars, two fine pistols, and two vials: one bright green and one of the cloudy white substance. 

He left to meet with [[The Stagehands]], grabbing multiple guns from the desk, and a red gem from the magical desk, and a snort of some sort of drug. Repainted the lock to appear gold. Blamed [[Preston Screk]] for the scratches  

### Background 
Involved in politics for about 40 years, father peaked as Deputy Mayor of [[Jalantar]]. Comes from a long time political dynasty family. However, that family is now bankrupt, but recently started making ends meet importing drugs with [[The Stagehands]]. Seems to have nefarious political actions, like conveniently persuading his opponents to move away or, in at least one case, disappear.

### Who're they to us? 
One of the two targets [[The Unforged Few]] is supposed to unseat in [[Operation Incriminating Letters]]. We planted a letter in his office and stole his cloudy potion.

Has previously worked with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]

Offered a one-on-one debate on politics with [[Costi]]

Thick vial of white viscous liquid in a bottle about 2 inches tall (it's not cum) 

### Notes
Seems a bit testy that [[Ellinev Del]] visited with us first, and claimed that he wrote a similar introductory letter that must have been lost in the mail. 

Next week, on grivokveir, his family is hosting their traditional ball. Invited [[The Unforged Few]] as his guests of honor, and to meet for a drink early.
