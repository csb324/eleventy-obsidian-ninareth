A beefy bartender who let us know the [[Arazoak]] were hiding out in his basement, for the right price (a big jewel). 

Later, he found us at [[Seven Hooves]] and tried to extort us -- Since [[Zephra]] had been so willing to hand over money, we seemed like easy targets. [[Freya]] ripped his organs out. 

According to [[Quarrin Witherspoon]], it's no great loss. He was a hothead, and the attack wasn't officially sanctioned by [[The Stagehands]]. 

[[Niko]] seemed to know this guy.
