 Large dragonborn, with teeth are filed down to points. Carries a greatsword.
 
Head of security at [[Pent Logging]], and has been known to travel as security with [[Norathar Pent]]. 

### Background
Used to be part of the dragons hide - an elite regiment of the guards also known as the “hidesman”.

### Who's he to us? 
Flirted with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] at the [[Promenade Aid Society]] event, but also seemed sus. Was there when [[Costi]] stole her [[Ring of Efreet Summoning]] for [[Operation Incriminating Letters]]

In absentee will hear about [[Rez]] as a "woodworker courrier" at [[Pent Logging]] sent by [[Limley]]. Seems like they have beef.
