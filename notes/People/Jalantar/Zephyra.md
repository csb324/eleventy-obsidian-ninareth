![](/assets/obsidian/Zephra.jpeg)

Half-elf half-tiefling with a leather skirt apron with a red hair pixie cut, with slightly violet skin and has very small horns. 

A craftwoman at [[The Gilded Instrument]], who specializes in the harp. Originally from an elven community in the [[Vrolbekk Forest]], very structured and strict eleven culture, she left home and started a new life in [[Zalev City]], where she fell in with a band of criminals -- the [[Arazoak]]. After a jewelry heist went wrong, she then fled [[Zalev]] for [[Jalantar]]. Claims to be reformed and wants a quiet life now.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] needed her to repair her old broken harp. In exchange, Zephra enlisted [[The Unforged Few]] to help track down members of the [[Arazoak]] who have turned up in [[Jalantar]], so we could find out what their plan was and stop them.

She (and some of the [[Arazoak]]) were captured by the [[Zalevi Military]] --  our friends [[Captain Fretze]] and co. 

Escaped in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]] and is with [[The Unforged Few]] in the [[Jalantar Sewers]]. 

### Who're they to us?
Has joined up with the [[Fire Raisers]], said there's been a split at [[The Furnace]] of one group who wants to prioritize innocents and another select few who disagree. Wants [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] to find the violent folks who haven't been rounded up, [[Srictha]] and [[Ulia Glorsbade]] and [[Winifey]], potentiallly [[Twigs]], to try and determine if they intentionally turned violent. [[Zephyra]] says it might be wise for them not to return. 

She thinks [[Niko]] wasn't in on this, and wants us to find him to disprove it.
