Blue dragonborn in silver robes with a staff, let us into the [[Temple of  Platinum Dragon in Jalantar]] where he is a Silverscale, a low ranking member of his organization. 

Silverscales are faces and welcoming committee in the OOTPD and also do lore. He's applying to the lore keeper program.

### Who Is He to Us?
Gave us information about the big day of attacks in [[Jalantar]]

[[Rez]] [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Freya]] talked to him about [[Jorus]]. Says the OOTPD has people watching, convinved him this was a secret mission. Last Krokkiear of every month they have a dinner open to all for OOTPD interest. Code phrase it's okay to talk "can I interest you in a curious folio?"
