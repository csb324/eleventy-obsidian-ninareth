We met at the sixes table at [[Seven Hooves]]. 

### Background

[[Dorian]] owes her money, but they seem to be friendly (sort of a mentor-mentee relationship).

She just opened a meadery in town -- [[Best Cask Mead]]. 

### Who're they to us?
She's being investigated by the [[Fire Raisers]] as part of the [[Fire Raiser Baddie Audit]], mostly because she hasn't been seen since the [[Bellisme Show]]. [[Winifey]] let us know she might be at the [[Ruins of Fort Chyvensti]], between [[Jalantar]] and [[Arkhosia (City)]]. 

Turns out she was hired by the [[Fire Raisers]] for the unique burnable metal fuses she makes that are near indestructible. She's made them 8. She's really part of the [[Goodbarrels]], on loaner for a job to the [[Fire Raisers]], but is pulling out due to the infighting. Gave us her contact, [[Khequi]], and left with her assistants.
