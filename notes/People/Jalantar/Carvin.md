Priest at the temple, recently started wearing a holy symbol for [[TrueSilver]] as well.

### Background
Was in the same metallurgy appretinceship as [[Divitston Goldstone]], but struggled the most out of anyone in the class. Seems to have finally found more of his place with [[Hugh]]'s help. 

### Who're they to us? 
Has been friendly to [[Hugh]], seems to have been partially converted by him, including:

[[Hernolig Alebringer]]- potbellied dwarven man in a long white tunic
[[Noralin Brickview]]- small and petite dwarven woman with very light stubble

They are starting a proposal for how to expand the practice in [[Jalantar]]
