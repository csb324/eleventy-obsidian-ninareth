2 foot jacked gnome, oversees E4 at [[Pent Logging North]]

Says the company keesp bringing in folks off the street, and they’re more a liability than help, many of them aren’t still around. 

### Background
Seems like a good guy in a bad situation, mentioned family and appears to be a longtime employee (which of course means he's in tremendous debt to the company)

### Who's he to us? 
Tested [[Rez]] and [[Freya]] on skills to place them for jobs. Hired them to work with him and apologized for being gruff.
