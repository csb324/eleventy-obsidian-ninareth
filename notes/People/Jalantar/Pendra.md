One of the sex workers at [[The Fiddlers Respite]]. A blue dragonborn woman. She wears a very fancy pantsuit. 

### Who Is She to Us?
Very thankful that [[The Unforged Few]] brought back [[Qik]] and [[Innis]]

Offered to help us know about certain politicans if needed.

Warned [[Costi]] away from hurting [[Qik]] as they beging to get to know each other.
