[Title:: 

Older woman, but looks good for her age. Small woman, dark skin and black hair, lithe in her movements. Always wears her knife.

Good friend of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] and is a regular guest at his manor. Was his classmate at [[Redscale]]. 

### Background
Something about [[Burbank FIT]]? Married to [[Cliff Burbank]], who's about to head to the "front" for work.

### Who're they to us? 
Knows [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] through [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. Seems to be genuinely fond of her.

[[Costi]] detected her thoughts, she was excited to see the concert and is unexplicably nervous. She also revealed her husband's work is involved in murder.
