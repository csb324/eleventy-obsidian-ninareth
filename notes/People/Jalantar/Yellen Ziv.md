A little shorter than [[Hugh]] and made of copper.  Has taken a severe amount of damage, is now missing a couple of fingers and an eye

Part of the Self Made Men, a group of awakened warforged who work for their collective rights with [[Magister]], and [[Daemon]]

### Background
Does not speak. Unsure if it's choice or damage. Uses paper and pen to communicate.

Does not like the southern cities, now chooses to be around the trees in [[Dilandil]], and lives outside civilization. 

Good at finding people.

Is 247 years old, one of the early models. Seems to have done a lot, previosuly owned a caravan company.  Does not work currently. 

### Who're They to Us?
Friendly with [[Hugh]] and introduced him to [[The Self Made Men]]
