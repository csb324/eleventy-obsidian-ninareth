### Background
Pleetos Alentas, from [[Thelran Asari]] and a sole survivor we know of from the [[Unscaled]].

Recently left [[Jalantar]] via airship, after getting a bronze scale grafted. [[Cortis]] believed he works at [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]] and works in rune crafting. 

[[Rez]] asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to help with [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]] and to scry on [[Pleetos Alentas]] - he feels a rocking motion and sees dark water and a middle-aged half-elf with long dark hair in a ponytail to his middle shoulder blades. Quite handsome, green eyes, tanned, sitting on a stool built into the deck of a ship. The wood is characteristic of northern half of [[Ninarith]], probably [[Taleem]]. It's sunny but there's small waves. He wears a loose-fitting green tunic with gold embroidery and simple brown trousers. He carries a sword, and no visible grafted-scales. A young human man fills his wine glass wearing a blue and white serving uniform, short-sleeved outfit. He's reading a book, Two Weeks With the Lizardmen. His eyes suddenly flash red coloring and reptilian pupils. It seems to be moving in an unclear direction, changing multiple times.

We also try [[Pleetos Alentas]], he's sitting in a garden, but [[Hugh|Finn]] doesn't recognize the flora, it's not tropical or [[Eberron]] or [[Dilandil]] -- when described to us it sounds like the [[Narathian Plains]] He's writing a letter, he can't see it all, but it seems as though he's writing orders, and sees it's addressed to [[Bhula Orbnose]], which [[Hugh|Finn]] believes to be a halfling name, and sees that they live in [[Durmask]], [[Hugh|Finn]] gets the street name and most of the number "X23 STREET NAME". He sends the letter at the end of the vision. 

[[notes-148]]: [[Trisha]] is going to send someone she knows in [[Thelran Asari]] to search any property he might own.
### Who're They to Us?
Worked with [[Burru Ilp]], [[Jorus]], and [[Sqwank]]

### Interactions
- Scry'd on him in [[notes-115]]. Believed to be on a boat in a lake in Durmask.
