[Affiliation::[[Fire Raisers]]

Blue dragonborn. 

A friendly patron of [[The Black Gull]] who has a falcon named [[Klaus (Falcon)|Klaus]]. Part of the [[Fire Raisers]]

Thinks [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] is the least trustworthy person and that [[Costi]] should never work with them.

### Who're They to Us?
Spoke with [[Costi]] about bird behavior. Attends the bird-dog-park in the [[Divian Wilds]]

Met us to get the items from [[Operation Incriminating Letters]]. Got the arrests done, but accidentally set some fires. [[Norathar Pent]] and [[Vigo Underswell]] are detained and awaiting trials

Told [[Costi]] that any weird vibes he picked up from [[Terrav]] were more about "no news being bad news" than anything else, but that focusing on the good is the best outlook.
