Blue dragonborn. 

A friendly patron of [[The Black Gull]] who has a falcon named [[Klaus (Falcon)|Klaus]]. Part of the [[Fire Raisers]]

Thinks [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] is the least trustworthy person and that [[Costi]] should never work with them.

Killed by [[Winifey]] in the [[Election Day Attack]].

### Who're They to Us?
Spoke with [[Costi]] about bird behavior. Attends the bird-dog-park in the [[Divian Wilds]]

Met us to get the items from [[Operation Incriminating Letters]]. Got the arrests done, but accidentally set some fires. [[Norathar Pent]] and [[Vigo Underswell]] are detained and awaiting trials

Told [[Costi]] that any weird vibes he picked up from [[Terrav]] were more about "no news being bad news" than anything else, but that focusing on the good is the best outlook. 

Paid the [[The Stagehands]] to hide him, he was put in [[Giary]]'s basement. He says he knows things went wrong at the [[Bellisme Show]]. He was there, helping folks hide, disgusing people. Says he was upset at how things went, saved some people with a few folks around him. He didn't like the energy in [[The Furnace]] afterwards, that everyone was being supicious and looking for someone to blame. His intutition told him to leave - so he did. He's been laying low ever sense, heard through some friends that the [[Fire Raisers]] were blaming him for the attack. 

Said things have been "off" for the last few weeks in the [[Fire Raisers]] before the [[Bellisme Show]]. There'd been a bunch of new recruits, but while most folks were excited, [[Cinder]] was acting frustrated. *Didn't seem to like the orders he was being given* (which is interesting, in retrospect). Understood the new folks were important people in the city, folks of signficance. 

Said most of the [[Fire Raisers]] activity goes to [[Arkhosia (City)]], he was supposed to bring down a wagon with green and black uniforms with yellow trimming, 40-50 of them. [[Cinder]] wrote the [[From the Ashes Flyer]]. Asked us if there was a way to help him get to [[Arkhosia (City)]], that he still believes in the [[Fire Raisers]] mission - and wants to be sure it happens in the right way.
