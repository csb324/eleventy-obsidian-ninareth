Halfling? (i'm pretty sure yes)

A famous illusionist Magi. A deputy under arch-magi at [[The Slavaadi College]], 

Outgoing and seems a bit kooky. 

Going back to the College in 3 months, maybe we go back and meet his friends, including his boss Archmagi Jacken?

Archmagi of the College, [[Salxif Finklefern]] - would take months. They say Rez needs to increase her standing, or pay about 20,000 GP 

Employs [[Neiragneg|Neir]], directed us to do further outreach to him.

Has to be one of the most capable illusionist on the continent, said he can make his illusions real. 

### Who're they to us? 
Connected to [[Rez]] by the [[Fire Raisers]], thought [[Neiragneg|Neir]] says they're not involved. 

If there is a surplus, they will set money aside to hire [[Rez]]. Maybe bring her on as an unpaid intern, or maybe an illict affair, in roughly 6 months. For Rez to make her ask to be turned into a dragon. 

Looked at [[Costi]]'s sword, and asked Samuel to go on the sword, but he could not. Believes there's a connection between him and the sword. Says something is shifting inside, like molten magic, that wants to solidify. He can't tell what they're connected to, even though he normally can, said it made sense if [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] was a warlock. Maybe it hadn't "decided yet". Also said he should get his familiar aligned.
