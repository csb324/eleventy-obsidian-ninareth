A half-orc who used to be a larger man, balding and in his late 30's. 

At his last sighting, he was 9.5ft tall, with two concentric spirals from the elbow down to the wrist in red and blue circles. His flesh seems swollen and it appears like the scales are starting to grow on their own. His torso is lumpy and his string has gone long and stringy. HIs teeth are filed down to points and his tounge is forked by surgery. He smells strongly of decaying flesh. Believes that the chromatic scales will merge and become gold. 

Carried a blue staff embedded with scales, the [[Blue Dragonstaff]].

### Background
A tinkerer, who works at [[Gorva's Observatory]]. 

Says he read a story when he was five, about a dragon who was persecuted long before his time. And when he read those pages, he just new that dragon was his ancestor. Claims he can trace his lineage directly to Galaphanel.Believed that Costi and I were his family descended from Galaphanel, and took us into the forge.

He has a couple of friends who also say the same thing. [[Father Thronestone]] gave him more scales, and Burru supplied some extra himself -- he thinks he might try to do this on other.


### Who're They to Us?
 [[Father Thronestone]] asked [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] if [[Rez]] still feels okay. Tells us he's in a tough spot - he bragged about the dragon scales, and one of his friends wanted it done too. Said he has dragon blood in his veins, and Thronestone grafted a significant number of blue and red scales onto his forearm, some directly into the bone. He's been acting strange since the procedure, almost seems taller, and showed a black eye he gave him. Said he can't bring this to the elders, and would pay us in kind if we would go take care of it. 

Promises he won't continue to do this, but seems so intrigued by it working with [[Rez]] that we think he might not be able to let it go. We said we'd be sure word of this doesn't get out. 

Originated the group that calls themselves the Unscaled.

### Threads
Has people that were delivering him dragon scales. People who hunt them or sell them, he doesn't know. [[Sqwank]] and some of the [[Wayfinders]] would bring them back. 

Got weirder in the last few weeks. Started to get some powers from it. Jorus worked at the [[Temple of  Platinum Dragon in Jalantar]], his notebook has all the research of what happened to [[Azir DarAxia|Saint Goldborn]] and trying to replicate it. 

Pleetos Alentas (from [[Thelran Asari]] via airship, and left after getting scales grafted. Got one brass scale added) is the only member of the Unscaled who isn't here. Think he works at the Academy and works in rune crafting. 

Signed in code, makes us a key that he gives to [[Costi]]. Showed us a trapdoor where all the bodies are hidden.

Borru bought the boulder for a lot of money, saying that it was a piece of a silver dragon. He kissed it, and swears he can feel a bit of warmth in it. 

Says [[Burru Ilp]] mostly talked about tinkering with [[Father Thronestone]]
