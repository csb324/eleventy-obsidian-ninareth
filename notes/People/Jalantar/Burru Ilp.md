A half-orc who used to be a larger man, balding and in his late 30's. 

At his last sighting, he was 9.5ft tall, with two concentric spirals from the elbow down to the wrist in red and blue circles. His flesh seems swollen and it appears like the scales are starting to grow on their own. His torso is lumpy and his string has gone long and stringy. HIs teeth are filed down to points and his tounge is forked by surgery. He smells strongly of decaying flesh. Believes that the chromatic scales will merge and become gold. 

Carried a blue staff embedded with scales, the [[Blue Dragonstaff]].

### Background
A tinkerer, who works at [[Gorva's Observatory]]. 

Says he read a story when he was five, about a dragon who was persecuted long before his time. And when he read those pages, he just new that dragon was his ancestor. Claims he can trace his lineage directly to Galaphanel.Believed that Costi and I were his family descended from Galaphanel, and took us into the forge.

He has a couple of friends who also say the same thing. [[Father Thronestone]] gave him more scales, and Burru supplied some extra himself -- he thinks he might try to do this on other.

### Ilp Estate

Lives in a nice estate in the [[The Fallsides]].  His house is themed in five chromatic colors: Ruby, Emerald, White Crystal, Onxy, and Sapphire. The gate is a dragon heads. The house is filled with rotting food, and is totally trashed. 

We look around, most of the walls have tapestries of major moments of dragon history: the battle of the fork from the first sundering, the battle of [[Guâ€™athrithen]] from the second sundering, [[Galaphanel]]'s flight from [[Durmask]] (behind which is a door), one depciting where [[Tiamat]] is being held, [[Bahamat]]'s asecension, one titled "boulder making" (two paneled a silver dragon surrounded by dwarves, and then those dwarves cheering around a boulder). Has a four volume titled "the second sundering", by the foremost expert on the second sundering -- [[Caleb DarAxia]]. Another small one depicting Kaycee riding a dragon.

On the ceiling is a major fresco, 60 ft panel 40t ft up, of [[Tiamat]] fighting [[Bahamat]].  Anything of value aside from the art is gone. All the metal and shiny things are gone. There are some gouged marks from what might be claws in the wood, like large wyrmling or very young adult but only seems one sided (on the right).

A hidden basement inside, a very large half-orc named Squawnk, around 8.5" tall with a left arm swollen and wrapped in a bandage. A club is on their back, modulated with glass and nails through it. A workshop is in the center of the space, it seems to be a forge (a silver dragonborn is inside).

A statue of a small red and blue dragon, but seems to be made of real scales -- patches have been torn off. A halfling, named Cortis, is strapped to a table who's been a long time member of their cult but now is begging not to have the procedure. 

### Who're They to Us?
 [[Father Thronestone]] asked [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] if [[Rez]] still feels okay. Tells us he's in a tough spot - he bragged about the dragon scales, and one of his friends wanted it done too. Said he has dragon blood in his veins, and Thronestone grafted a significant number of blue and red scales onto his forearm, some directly into the bone. He's been acting strange since the procedure, almost seems taller, and showed a black eye he gave him. Said he can't bring this to the elders, and would pay us in kind if we would go take care of it. 

Promises he won't continue to do this, but seems so intrigued by it working with [[Rez]] that we think he might not be able to let it go. We said we'd be sure word of this doesn't get out. 

Originated the group that calls themselves the Unscaled.

### Threads
Has people that were delivering him dragon scales. People who hunt them or sell them, he doesn't know. [[Sqwank]] and some of the [[Wayfinders]] would bring them back. 

Got weirder in the last few weeks. Started to get some powers from it. Jorus worked at the [[Temple of  Platinum Dragon in Jalantar]], his notebook has all the research of what happened to [[Azir DarAxia|Saint Goldborn]] and trying to replicate it. 

Pleetos Alentas (from [[Thelran Asari]] via airship, and left after getting scales grafted. Got one brass scale added) is the only member of the Unscaled who isn't here. Think he works at the Academy and works in rune crafting. 

Signed in code, makes us a key that he gives to [[Costi]]. Showed us a trapdoor where all the bodies are hidden.

Borru bought the boulder for a lot of money, saying that it was a piece of a silver dragon. He kissed it, and swears he can feel a bit of warmth in it. 

Says [[Burru Ilp]] mostly talked about tinkering with [[Father Thronestone]]
