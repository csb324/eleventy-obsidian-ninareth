Red hair assassin with [[Arazoak]]. 

First, the [[Arazoak]] planned to break [[Sarker]] out of the [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar]]. Then, [[Rosco]] and [[Drenden]] got taken as well. So, she planned to break [[Rosco]], [[Drenden]], [[Sarker]] and [[Zephyra]] out, and she did not want our help (which was great, because we did not want to help).

Except then, [[Niko]] and [[Qik]] were also taken by the [[Zalevi Military]]. And then we were invested. So, we got back in touch with her, and now she's on the team for the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]].
