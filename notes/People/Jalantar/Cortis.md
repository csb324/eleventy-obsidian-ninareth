Halfling

### Background
[[Burru Ilp]] spotted him at a party and told him he had the blood of the dragon. Fronted the money and connections for him to get into high society -- ignored his bullshit. He was always insane but never hurt anyone, didn't specifically talk about [[Tiamat]]. Recognizes he was so wrong. Works at and owns the Laughing Hill, a bar in the [[The Promenade]]. 

### Who's he to us? 
Has people that were delivering him dragon scales. People who hunt them or sell them, he doesn't know. Squwank and some of the [[Wayfinders]] would bring them back. Called themselves the Unscaled. 

Got weirder in the last few weeks. Started to get some powers from it. [[Jorus]] worked at the [[Temple of  Platinum Dragon in Jalantar]], his notebook has all the research of what happened to [[Azir DarAxia|Saint Goldborn]] and trying to replicate it. 

Pleetos Alentas (from [[Thelran Asari]] via airship, and left after getting scales grafted. Got one brass scale added) is the only member of the Unscaled who isn't here. Think he works at the Academy and works in rune crafting. 

Signed in code, makes us a key that he gives to [[Costi]]. 

Borru bought the boulder for a lot of money, saying that it was a piece of a silver dragon. He kissed it, and swears he can feel a bit of warmth in it. 

Says [[Burru Ilp]] mostly talked about tinkering with [[Father Thronestone]]
