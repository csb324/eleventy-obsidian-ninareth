Female wood-elf bronze skinned with intricate long black braids. Wearing a fine emerald dress, subtly incredibly expensive. A circlet and on her right ring finger she has a silver band.

Merchant out of the Promenade, provider delegate. 

### Background 
From [[Dilandil]]. Rose to prominence supplying fine lumber, pretty voal about wanting to reform property rights in the Promenade. Most of her senior employees have land through the corporation. Voraciously buys land across Jalantar outside under false names, but only in amounts just short enough to give citizenship to restrict vote access

Lucrative contract with a “prominent merchant from [[Dilandil]], Luzumin Doront, should bring many jobs to the area”

Primary donor to the [[Promenade Aid Society]] and the “Promenade Alms”. 

### Who're they to us? 
One of the two targets [[Our Party]] is supposed to unseat in [[Operation Incriminating Letters]].
