One of the sex workers at [[The Fiddlers Respite]]. A copper-skinned Zalevi woman. She seems to have taken a liking to [[Costi]].

She's on the young side -- somewhere near age 20. She carries a dagger and seems pretty excited to use it. 

A newly minted fan of [[The Miscasts]].

Was recently apprehended by the [[Zalevi Military]], for unknown past offenses. She was released in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]] and escaped with [[Innis]].
