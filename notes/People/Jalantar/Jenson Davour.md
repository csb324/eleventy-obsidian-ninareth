The manager of [[the Miscasts]], among other acts.

### Who's he to us? 
He's very well known and connected in the music industry. He's struggled to handle [[Rez]], but after we saved [[Rian]] from [[Jecka]], he's agreed to let bygones be bygones, and even give her a pass for some bygones yet to come. 

He sounds willing to represent [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], but only in the event that it wouldn't put him in hot water with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. 

Introduced us to [[The Curator]], presumably at the Curator's request. Seemed anxious. Still, has some kind of relationship with [[The Collection]], and we are certainly not the first people he's put in touch with them. Uncharacteristcally serious in telling [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] not to mention them . 

Got [[The Miscasts]] an audition to open for the [[Bellisime]]
