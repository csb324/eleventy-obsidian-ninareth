Red-scaled and yellow-striped dragonborn, working as a greeter at the [[Temple of Pelor in Jalantar]]

### Who're they to us? 
We tried to give him the [[Summoning Stone]], but said it was too dangerous. He took a message with our situation and promised to find the appropriate person for us to speak with. Made an appointment for our return.
