A tall olive skinned human woman, with dark braid running halfway down her back.

Second in command to [[Captain Fretze]] in the [[Zalevi Military]] 

Figured out it was us during the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]], we killed her in the prisoner holding area. #rip 

She was a monk, and she brought a displacer beast with her to the fight. Was this her pet?  Or did they only meet that day? Did they snuggle sometimes? #mysteries
