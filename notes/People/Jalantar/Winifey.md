Very lanky human woman, with poorly cut shaggy brown hair. Wears a steel breastplate and carries a rapier. Very smiley, seeems to be part of the welcoming committee at [[The Furnace]]. She's also a member of the Guard of [[Jalantar]]. Not the [[Dragon's Hide]], just regular guard. 

Very close with [[Cinder]]. Sort of his right hand. 

Associate of [[Niko]], part of the [[Fire Raisers]].

Has [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] tattooed on her body. Gave [[Willum]] some sort of time-reversing item that he used in our confrontation in the [[Election Day Attack]]. 

Killed [[Srictha]].

### Who're they to us?
At the [[Bellisme Show]] -- they asked us to help her get past a couple of guards to eavesdrop on a meeting. We made her invisible and helped her sneak through. 

Knew [[Neiragneg|Neir]] on sight, asked if he had checked in with [[Rhend Triverswill]] yet.

Met up with us and says she's quite close to [[Niko]], who worked the [[Bellisme Show]]. She thinks [[Niko]] has crossed a bridge and potentially brought others along with him. Gives us the [[Fire Raiser Mystery Cylinder]] to look into it. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Freya]] seems to get vibes she's not being entirely truthful.  [[Costi]] detects her thoughts, sees a red undillating wave when we mention what plans might be coming up in [[Arkhosia (City)]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks about other radicals within the [[Fire Raisers]] who could be problems: in her thoughts [[Costi]] sees [[Niko]], a tiefling, and a flash of [[Cinder]]. Tells us about an old [[Fire Raisers]] hideout on the road to [[Arkhosia (City)]], asks for us to check-in. 

### Notes
Knew that us killing the dust monster we fought would bring out the Efreet at the [[Bellisme Show]]
