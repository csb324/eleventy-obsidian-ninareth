Very lanky human woman, with poorly cut shaggy brown hair. Wears a steel breastplate and carries a rapier. Very smiley, seeems to be part of the welcoming committee at [[The Furnace]]

Associate of [[Niko]], part of the [[Fire Raisers]]

### Who're they to us?
At the [[Bellisme Show]] -- they asked us to help her get past a couple of guards to eavesdrop on a meeting. We made her invisible and helped her sneak through. 

Knew [[Neiragneg|Neir]] on sight, asked if he had checked in with [[Rhend Triverswill]] yet.

### Notes
Knew that us killing the dust monster we fought would bring out the Efreet at the [[Bellisme Show]]
