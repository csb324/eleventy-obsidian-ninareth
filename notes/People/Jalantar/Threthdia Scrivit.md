Large broadshouldered woman, in the most outlandish outfit we've seen of the night. Near 6'3" and in her late 80's

She's secretary of arts and cutlure in [[Jalantar]], for about 40 years. Her family is influential and her mother used to be the Secretary before her.

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is unconvinced that her family is as established as it is stated to be, he believes it might all just be her, continuously seeming like a new generation. Very few of her enemies are still around. He thinks she is not human. 

Has an EA she can't live without, but doesn't remember their name. (It's Devin, thanks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]])

### Who're they to us? 
Met [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] a few times, but [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] warned her to be careful. Asked if she'd considered taking a seat on the board. 

Her house was one of the [[Mysterious Explosions]], oops. 

MIGHT BE HAG MOTHER of [[The Beauties of Shadow]]
	At the library, [[Costi]] and [[Freya]] look for information on [[Threthdia Scrivit]] in [[The Talon]]. Costi does an exceptional job, and learns that she's mentioned almost every single edition. Tracing the Scrivit lineage, he sees a pattern in behavior - essentially every other Scrivit acts in a similiar way, donating to the same sorts of organization, favoring the same types of artists, etc. Seems like an X, A, X, B, X, C type family pattern.

[[Hugh]] looked for

### Notes
[[Costi]] detects thoughts and find unmitigated rage, but not directed at [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]
