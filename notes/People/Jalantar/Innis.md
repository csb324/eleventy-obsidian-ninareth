A slender half-elf woman, in nice clothes with long hair, returning home from making a delivery.

A paladin who takes no shit. Traveled with [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout]] and [[Livia]] on the road through the [[Vrolbekk Forest]]. Tangled with some [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Pixies]] on the road.

She runs a brothel called [[The fiddlers respite]] in [[Jalantar]].

Joe's friend Maraid!
