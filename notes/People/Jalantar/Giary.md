A friend that [[Niko]] is staying with in [[Jalantar]]. Owns [[The Sheath and Sickle]]. 

Short hair, large previously broken nose, big guy.

He's a tickettaker in [[The Stagehands]]. 

Charming, outgoing, and loves his very sticky bar.

He and [[Innis]] have a troubled business history. Innis is still mad about it, Giary is not.

Slept with [[Rez]]. Calls [[Costi]] Omlette.

For fifty gold, which we gave him, he's going to ask around about [[Costi's Dad]].
