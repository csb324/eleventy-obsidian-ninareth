Short hair, large previously broken nose, big guy. Charming, outgoing, and loves his very sticky bar.

### Background 
Long-time friend of [[Niko]] is staying with in [[Jalantar]]. Owns [[The Sheath and Sickle]]. Has a lot of shared history with [[Niko]]. Friends with mutual sketchy contact [[Doriq]]

He's a tickettaker in [[The Stagehands]]. 

He and [[Innis]] have a troubled business history. Innis is still mad about it, Giary is not.

### Who's he to us? 
Slept with [[Rez]]. 
Calls [[Costi]] Omlette.

Helped us rescue [[Niko]] in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]], secured [[Hawktails]] disguises for us, broke in with [[Kara]] and [[Innis]], and escaped on his own. 

For fifty gold, which we gave him, he's going to ask around about [[Costi's Dad]].

Worked with [[The Stagehands]] to help "misplace" [[Rez]]'s [[Jalantar]] visa that was sponsored by [[Niko]]
