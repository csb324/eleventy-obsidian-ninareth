![](/assets/obsidian/Giary%20Crop.jpg)

Short hair, large previously broken nose, big guy. Charming, outgoing, and loves his very sticky bar.

## Background 
Long-time friend of [[Niko]] is staying with in [[Jalantar]]. Owns [[The Sheath and Sickle]]. Has a lot of shared history with [[Niko]]. Friends with mutual sketchy contact [[Doriq]]

He's a tickettaker in [[The Stagehands]]. 

He and [[Innis]] have a troubled business history. Innis is still mad about it, Giary is not.

Ran an old bar named Petunia's. 

### Who's he to us? 

##### General
Slept with [[Rez]]. 
Calls [[Costi]] Omlette.

##### Zalevi Embassy Break-in
Helped us rescue [[Niko]] in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]], secured [[Hawktails]] disguises for us, broke in with [[Kara]] and [[Innis]], and escaped on his own. 

##### The Stagehands
For fifty gold, which we gave him, he's going to ask around about [[Costi's Dad]].

Worked with [[The Stagehands]] to help "misplace" [[Rez]]'s [[Jalantar]] visa that was sponsored by [[Niko]]

Took a contract from [[The Unforged Few]] for [[Operation Incriminating Letters]] and seems to be playing the middle line between [[The Stagehands]] and the [[Fire Raisers]].

- Information on when [[Norathar Pent]] and [[Vigo Underswell]] would be out of their respective offices
- Possibly *moving* when they would be out of their offices to a time that is more convenient for us
- Getting [[The Stagehands]] to look the other way, if something perhaps happened when those people were out of their offices

Followed up to tell us two things:
1. [[Vigo Underswell]] would be meeting with [[The Stagehands]] in five days. We asked if he could make that three. We're on a deadline.
2. [[Norathar Pent]] would be in a public setting tomorrow, at 2pm, for a charity event with the [[Promenade Aid Society]]. 

#### Fire Raisers
Has been liaising with them since we introduced him after the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]].
