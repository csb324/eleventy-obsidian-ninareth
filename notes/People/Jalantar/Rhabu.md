A dark skinned human woman.

Under the command to [[Captain Fretze]] in the [[Zalevi Military]] Guard who let us in, and was responsible for watching up after the first explosion in the  [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]. Figured out who we were, [[Our Party]] killed her in the arts room and made it appear like she died in the explosions. #rip
