A well-groomed half-orc man with a long shiny black ponytail. In very fine clothing, immacuately kept, and a gold rapier on his belt.

He's incredibly loyal.

### Who Is He to Us?
Knows [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] through her work with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. Rude to her, who rightfully told us he sucked. 

Picked up [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp from [[Raven]] at the [[The Gilded Instrument]] and recognized that it is from [[Corellon Larethian]]. Was werid about it.
