A well-groomed half-orc man with a long shiny black ponytail. In very fine clothing, immacuately kept, and a gold rapier on his belt.

Born in [[Mulfara]]. He told us, he's had nothing, and he's had everything, and he'd like to keep having everything, but that doesn't mean everyone else has to have nothing. Was appointed to the [[Arkhosian Delegates]] at the last minute to replace delegates lost in the [[Election Day Attack]]. The next day, announced a third party platform: [[The Listeners]]. This was not [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s idea.

Henrik is *actually* doing what we always *think* we're doing -- playing both sides, to his advantage. We could learn a lot from him tbh. 

### Who Is He to Us?
Knows [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] through her work with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. Rude to her, who rightfully told us he sucked. But later, he seemed to actually have developed something of a soft spot for [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. Mostly after her death.

Picked up [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp from [[Raven]] at the [[The Gilded Instrument]] and recognized that it is from [[Corellon Larethian]]. Was werid about it.

He knows we're trying to get [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back. We haven't been subtle in our requests for diamonds, apparently.
