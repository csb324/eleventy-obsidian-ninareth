> The see a woman approaching, in an optical illusion dress that wraps around her -- she has green hair and pale skin with big round glasses. Seems like she's human. If she pulls up her bangs, you can see that she turns green and has no ears. 

### Background
[[Jade]] claims to be from Mulfara, and says she doesn't work for anyone. Speaks undercommon. 

Says she has an associate, a dear friend, who made it his lives mission to get to know about the [[bridges]]

She has a mother and three fathers, and that is normal where she's from. She's Yuan-Ti, and family's form little groups to raise families. Her mom looks more like a snake, and her family are all different versions. 

### Who's She to Us? 
Is clearly fascinated by [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]], and claims that she's going to follow us around (and has been doign so for some time)

She says she wants answers, but specifically "what do we know about who you're working with", and clearly references [[The Curator]]. She doesn't claim to know much about [[The Curator]], but claims to have a "loose relationship" with them. [[Costi]] picks up she seems to have met them. It's clear that [[Jade]] is looking for answers, and shares the same type of partnership that [[Freya]] does.
