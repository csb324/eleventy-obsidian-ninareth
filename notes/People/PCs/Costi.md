## Backstory
Teen. Played Mage Pong at [[AVAD]]. Seems to have had a long lost love or an encounter with corruption or something. 

He's looking for [[Costi's Dad|his dad]]. One day, a warforged named [[Hugh|Human Named Finn]] showed up and said he was gonna be dad now. That's been going... okay.

[[Costi's mom]] and his [[Costi's sister|baby sister]] all also like Hugh. So that's good. But still.

Hugh brought a mysterious message from [[Costi's Dad]] -- one of which is "Kiss the stone" or something. It's long and not very specific. 

> But, this is why Costi kissed the thrice-travelled emerald and now he has a sapphire tooth.
