## Backstory
Teen (19 to be exact) from [[Glendan Glade]] (or perhaps not, but he definitely said the word glensdale).

Played Mage Pong at [[AVAD]]. Seems to have had a long lost love or an encounter with corruption or something. 

He's looking for [[Costi's Dad|his dad]]. One day, a warforged named [[Hugh|Human Named Finn]] showed up and said he was gonna be dad now. That's been going... okay.

[[Costi's mom]] and his [[Nadia|baby sister]] all also like [[Hugh]]. So that's good. But still.

Hugh brought a mysterious message from [[Costi's Dad]] -- 

>Protect the family near [[Glendan Glade]]
>Find the stone and kiss it for me
>Hold the blade

But, this is why Costi kissed the thrice-travelled emerald and now he has a sapphire tooth. 

Costi has a raven named [[Samuel]]. Samuel won't talk to him. He has never heard of something like this happening, and it annoys and troubles him.
