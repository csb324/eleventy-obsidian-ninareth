<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Affiliation</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Our Party]]</span></span>

A <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Class</span><span class="inline-field-value">Cleric</span></span> of [[TrueSilver]].

Insists he's [[Costi]]'s dad. But also, wants to help Costi *FIND* his dad.

Has no memories beyond the last year or so (someone went in and scrambled his brain around or something). 

Likes to knit. Has knit many little hats for [[Nadia]]. Likes birds?

Knew [[Costi's Dad]] in the war, maybe. This part is unclear I think. Might be part of the memory loss.
