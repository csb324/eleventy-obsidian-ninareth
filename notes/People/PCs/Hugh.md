# Hugh
[Status::alive]
[Race::Warforged]
[Home::[[Eberron]]]
[Affiliation::[[Our Party]]]
[Class::Cleric]

Insists he's [[Costi]]'s dad. But also, wants to help Costi *FIND* his dad.

Has no memories beyond the last year or so (someone went in and scrambled his brain around or something)

Likes to knit. Has knit many little hats for [[Costi's sister]]. Likes birds?

Knew [[Costi's Dad]] in the war, maybe. This part is unclear I think. Might be part of the memory loss.
