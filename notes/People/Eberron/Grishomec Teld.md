He's an older minotaur, with graying fur, lots of muscle but some weight on top of it. He has a broken horn and a number of facial piercings, with well-worn armor and a huge tower shield on his back. He carries a giant axe seemingly made of bones forged together. His left hand is horrifically mangled and appears unusable. Doesn't seem to slow him down much.

### Background
He's a Captain in the [[Eberronian Military]] and leads the [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]], but has been actively challenging [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] for control of the [[Eberronian Second Division]]. 

### Who're They To Us?
Leader or in leadership position of seventh brigade. ELA does not like him. [[Nadia]] told [[Costi]] to alert her should Gishomec’s troops leave after the execution of [[Marina Alduchev]], [[Nicky]], [[Private Hageth]] et al.

Has a particular dislike of [[Hugh|Finn]]. He dislikes warforged in general, but takes particular fault in [[Hugh|Finn]] escaping service - he believes it might be the reason of his lack of progressing through the ranks. 

He's leading the search for [[ELA]] camps outside the [[Burbank Compound]], that we're hoping to sabotage ([[Don't Tell Teld]])
