Went to [[AVAD]] with [[Costi]]. Used to date [[Marius A]]. Now works in the [[Viliki]] city hall, in transportation and infrastructure. 

Paid [[Garida]]'s bar tab at the [[Founding Flagon]]. But, didn't want anyone to know she liked to do that kind of thing. Bad for the brand.

Helped [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] with some "party supplies" before we confronted [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]]. She seemed to be holding something back, but definitely capable. We made a big deal about introducing her to [[Trisha]], which sparked something a little weirdly hostile in her.

When we left town, she approached [[Costi]] in the middle of the night and asked him to help [[ELA]] break [[Nicky]] out of prison at the [[Burbank Compound]]. Costi accepted, but the plan was foiled nonetheless.

Executed by [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] after being found guilty of treason. Her dying act was an [[ELA]] salute.
