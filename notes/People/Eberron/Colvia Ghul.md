### Who're They To Us?
One of [[Grishomec Teld|Capt. Teld]]'s inner circle, related to [[Don't Tell Teld]].

She's our lead, and any of our info should go through her first. It's been made clear that she'll be with us the whole time. She is making notes in a journal of what we say, our individual skills, and any indiscretions of [[Hugh|Finn]]. 

She’s so curious about us. she’s done her research.
