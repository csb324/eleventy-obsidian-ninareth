Human in robes. 
### Background
Worshipper of [[Ioun]], has several close lieutenants:  [[Bouzad Rukhol]], [[Jamzik Zodevzo]], [[Bez]], [[Grizaf]], and [[Ignatz]].

She's leaning into counter-terrorism work for the [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]]. She is "on detail." According to [[Fingers]] ([[notes-115]]), she reports directly to the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] in "special intelligence" and not actually a member of the battalion or even [[Eberronian Second Division]]. Her previous detail was with the [[Eberronian First Division]].
### Who're They To Us?
One of [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]'s inner circle, related to [[Don't Tell Teld]].

She's our lead, and any of our info should go through her first. It's been made clear that she'll be with us the whole time. She is making notes in a journal of what we say, our individual skills, and any indiscretions of [[Hugh|Finn]]. 

She’s so curious about us. she’s done her research.
