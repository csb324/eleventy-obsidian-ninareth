Duchess of the [[Dharinov Duchy]]. Date of Suspected Undeath: 3437

### Costi Research

There are detailed accountings of her troop numbers, areas of fortification and weakness. You find records of weapons purchases, some as recent as last month and going back decades. 

Her personal file is quite redacted, but it appears they have details on her personal life, on those close to her including a long, long list of paramours and lovers, and suspected children. 

There are folios on all of her military officers, as well, including one on [[Cliff Burbank]]. They're surprised he's that high ranking.
