We killed him and it was a whole fuckin thing.

We originally found his name in [[Viliki]], in [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]]'s notes. When we got to [[Jezeten]], we decided to follow up and see what he was up to. Which is to say, we broke into his house.

It turns out, he was luring people to secret [[Pelor]]-worship meetings, but those were a *trap*! He was actually killing everyone and using their bodies for horrible necromancy. 

We showed up to a meeting. We were *supposed* to just be doing surveillance, but [[Rez]] didn't want him to get away, so there was a confrontation and we killed him *and* his massive zombie, who had some fundamental qualities in common with the [[flesh stitched behemoth]]. 

After killing him, we realized we would probably want to cover our tracks, so [[Costi]] impersonated a taller version of him wearing very cool platform boots. The Costi-courtev then invited Adrienne and Rez inside his house (which was under surveillance), presumably for sex. Presumably because of the boots.

For some reason, this didn't fool [[Colvia Ghul]]. She figured out that we killed him and used it to blackmail us into sharing the secrets of [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]]. (We tried to argue that the [[Burbanks]] had actually authorized us to follow up on illegal necromancy, but neither Colvia nor the Burbanks themselves were interested in that angle).

Anyway, now if [[Colvia Ghul]] wants to blackmail us, she has *way* better shit to use, so, hopefully this man stops being relevant. But eventually, I imagine we'll want to deal with the third necromancer in this ring, [[Salid]].
