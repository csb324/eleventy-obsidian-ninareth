A Zalevi guard. When she first met us, we were asking to see [[Captain Fretze]]. Assuming we were full of shit, she brought us in, but she was surprised to find out we *did* know the captain. [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] jokingly said we were probably stronger than her.

We killed her maybe [[session-20|15 minutes later]].
