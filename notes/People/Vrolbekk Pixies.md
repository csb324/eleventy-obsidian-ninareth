# Vrolbekk Pixies

[Status::alive]
[Race::Fey]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Vrolbekk Forest]]]

A pranking duo who tried to put us to sleep, knocked the wheel off a cart, and then asked for our help. It was basically extortion but [[Rez]] liked their style. After we killed their SPEEEDY cousin, they were grateful and said to hit them up if we passed through again. So, that's nice.
