### Background
A few centuries ago, there was an organization by the name of [[The Silver Hand]], remnants still exist today in some cities, that are largely cut off from the principal body that use to exist. A front group. One of the founders, a woman named Opal (a talented warrior and scholar), were some of the first creators of dunamancy. 

Details are scarce, but a key player, only known by M, or [[Morthos]], believed to be a high-elf and one of the few survivors of [[Gu’athrithen]] was rumored to be trying to unseat [[Vecna]] as the god of death. It appears he failed, at least [[Vecna]] still exists.

### Who're They to Us?
[[Magister]] thinks the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]] we found was a temple to [[Morthos]]. It seems like someone unknown in [[Jalantar]] #mysteries  could be experimenting in [[dunamancy]] in new and exciting ways, and [[Magister]] wants to learn more. He asks [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] to keep an eye out for information on [[dunamancy]], [[Vecna]], [[Morthos]], or high-eleven. And [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] about [[Blood Magic]].
