Azir was a hero of the [[The Three Dragons War]], who helped defeat [[Tiamat]]. He is now also known as a Saint Goldborn of the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]]

### The Myth of Saint Goldborn
After [[Tiamat]], there was still something missing. 

Many many cruel dragons were still here greedy and cruel and scheming, and yet there was nothing to balance them out. 

So the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]] worked with one of the greatest heroes, Azir, and together they found a way to bring metallic dragons back to the world. There arenâ€™t very many, but there is now bulwark against evil forces. 

They say, that as Azir was drawing his last breath, [[Bahamut]] came down to him, and as a boon turned into a gold dragon. They believe he still watches over us from the [[Ragndaar mountains]]. 

They believe this process let in another gold dragon that lives in the same mountains named Darazier.
