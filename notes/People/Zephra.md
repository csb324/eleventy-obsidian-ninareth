A craftwoman at [[The Gilded Instrument]], who specializes in the harp. Originally from the [[Vrolbekk Forest]], she left home and started a new life in [[Zalev City]], where she fell in with a band of criminals -- the [[Arazoak]]. After a jewelry heist went wrong, she then fled [[Zalev]] for [[Jalantar]].

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] needs her to repair her old broken harp! She enlisted [[Our Party]] to help track down members of the [[Arazoak]] who have turned up in [[Jalantar]], in exchange. 

It *seems* she's been captured.
