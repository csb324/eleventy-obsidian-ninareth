A craftwoman at [[The Gilded Instrument]], who specializes in the harp. Originally from the [[Vrolbekk Forest]], she left home and started a new life in [[Zalev City]], where she fell in with a band of criminals -- the [[Arazoak]]. After a jewelry heist went wrong, she then fled [[Zalev]] for [[Jalantar]].

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] needed her to repair her old broken harp. In exchange, Zephra enlisted [[Our Party]] to help track down members of the [[Arazoak]] who have turned up in [[Jalantar]], so we could find out what their plan was and stop them.

It seems she (and some of the [[Arazoak]]) have been captured by the [[Zalevi Military]] -- possibly even our friends [[Captain Fretze]] and co.
