A very handsome face with pronounced cheekbones, a cut jaw, blond hair, with a smirk and pointed ears. He has a scar just under the edge of his left eye. Very charming demeanor. 

### Background
The [[Arkhosia (City)]] leader of the [[Fire Raisers]]. A former guard, where he worked with [[Varras]]. 

### Who're They to Us?
Met our party at [[Laughing Hill]] with [[Cut]] and [[Hennurra]]

Instructing [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] on the work needed for the [[Fire Raisers]]
	Asked if the delivery of "eight barrels of 3434" happening tomorrow, with all 8 barrels? Do you know where your next delivery will take place? 
	Recommends [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] stops by the [[Starving Stars]] - and ask a colleague of his to "see if they're looking for 3398". 
	Told us to come to dinner at [[Flounder's]] to give our full report since leaving [[Jalantar]]
