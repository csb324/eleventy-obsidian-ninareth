An older elf, slightly beyond middle-age, balding with shorter dark brown hair, appears like quite a regular person but in leather armor. He's got the holy symbol of [[Corellon Larethian]] around his neck. 

### Background
His name is [[Willow]], he's familiar with us. He thinks something is majorly wrong with the world, but he can't say anything about it without starting to choke on his tongue. Any way he's tried to get the memories out has almost killed him. He thinks there's something wrong with everything, and he thinks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] might be part of stopping it.

Claims to be an Oracle, someone with a direct tie to a god, probably [[Corellon Larethian]]. He gets "visions" - some come to pass and some don't , but he had a vision about music - a particular song played a particular way - and shortly later he heard it, from [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]].

### Who's He to Us?
He's known [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] since she was quite small, but she wouldn't know him. He thinks she's very important.  He's 'helped' her all along, he arranged a scholarship for her. After she started working for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]],  he got a job as a guard so he could give her a dagger with a message of "finding another way". Notably, he couldn't see [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s face at all, it's just dark. He could "keep an eye on her" through the knife, and making sure she stayed on the "right path". He says he hasn't heard her music since she died, and the dreams have been worse.

He's currently being pulled toward [[Quaath]]. He thinks we need to go there, and bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp. 

[[Hugh]] asked if he can help us [[Resurrect Adrienne]], and he says he knows how important it to bring her back. He says every time he looks at a calendar it flashes to the month Hulfni (which is three months way) and the Miirkikear (Day of the Songs) in that month. He thinks if we go there then, and play a song on the harp, he'll have a fit that shows us how to bring back [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. [[Costi]] shares his vision of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and it seems to be shockingly similar.

If something happens to him we're supposed to talk to [[No-Karo]] - another oracle he trusts: they change their appearance regularly, but last they were human middle-aged with a pink mohawk, living in [[Cerendon]], they're an oracle of [[Pelor]].

He says people are after him, one has a face writhed in flames with horns, he's 14ft tall, [[Costi]] thinks it sounds like a pit fiend, he watches him from the sky. Another is a younger human man, with curly brown hair and dark skin, in his 20's, with feathery wings he doesn't use who watches from the same. The last is an un-dead looking creature with mostly bone, sunken eyes with something there in both who watches from below. #mysteries 

Told us to meet at the [[Temple of Corellon Outside Quaath]], where he's staying on mission [[Resurrect Adrienne]]

### Resurrecting Adrienne

[[Willow]] waits in the room and plucks at a lute. We give him the harp, and after a weighted pause he begins plucking strings. At first it was random, but eventually falls into the recognizable tune [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] warmed up with every morning. It transitions into the first song we heard her play. As he progresses, he starts to worsen, gagging, then shaking. Eventually flying into a strangled seizure, body tense while his hands still play, before a vine bursts out of his mouth. It moves through the room like a snake, until it touches the far wall and connects - growing upwards. Tendrils of vine pull out of it, until a 10 square foot area is created, building over itself until a thick patch is generated. Suddenly, everything freezes, as a blade cuts through the vine, showing a tall bronze skinned short dark curly hair and shirtless humanoid, coming from a white pool of light. He recognizes [[Willow]], begins to speak, as four spear points pierce his chest, then a sword crashed through his skull, and he's yanked back towards a now purple portal and 5 shadowy creatures stand mid-attack.
