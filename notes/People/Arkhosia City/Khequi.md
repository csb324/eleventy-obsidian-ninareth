A white aarakocra with black tipped feathers pulled back into a psuedo-ponytail behind the bar. 

### Background
Works at the [[Kindness Kiln]] as a front for his work with the [[Fire Raisers]]. 

### Who're They to Us?
Told by [[Ulia Glorsbade]] that they're a point for the [[Fire Raisers]], awaiting with her next assignment. 

Gave us [[Ulia Glorsbade]]'s assignment, which included the [[Fire Raiser Cipher]] 

Told us he's not sure if [[Winifey|Winnie]] has made it town yet, but [[Flyte]] is where she'd be, though no one goes within 3-4 days of visiting him.
