Friend of Freya's. Returned to [[Arkhosia (City)]] the day we left. Gave Freya an autobiography of a relatively powerful individual who traversed the planes, solved a lot of problems in the fire plane, and was one of the first people to document [[Sigil]].

Has a varied relationship with [[Akros]]. They dated.
