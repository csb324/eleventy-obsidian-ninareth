A small gold-feathered Aaracokra. The bartender at [[Laughing Hill]]. Had me fooled. 

### Background
A member of the  [[Arkhosia (City)]] [[Fire Raisers]]. Seems to report to their leader, [[Willum]]. We learned she's one of their best agents, that she's a real chameleon.

### Who're They to Us?
Met our party at [[Laughing Hill]] with [[Willum]]. Works with [[Willum]] and [[Cut]].
