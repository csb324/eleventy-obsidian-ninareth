A deeply blue tiefling with an eye patch over his right eye. Seems menacing and not that bright, fucks us up every idiom he says. Loves to toss daggers around. 

Did not give a shit if anyone died in the [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]] bombing. 

### Background
A member of the  [[Arkhosia (City)]] [[Fire Raisers]]. Seems to be close to their leader, [[Willum]]. 

### Who're They to Us?
Met our party at [[Laughing Hill]] with [[Willum]]. Works with [[Hennurra]].
