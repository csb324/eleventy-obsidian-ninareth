An [[Alhoon]] that is tied to the army of undead. A tentacled creature about 7ft tall with gold fingers. He says "you finally arrive. I've said it before and I'll say it again. It' is not too late, you can turn around, you can come take a look (pointing at the largest section of root, where a large pulsing void is on it), you can take a look inside and see what we have to offer"

Had a minion, [[Bagath Mizzragon]], pull out a holy symbol that is [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]]. 

"violence resistance is futile, lay down your arms and join us", when we're up he adds "why can't you see sense?" "We offer the end"

Jade's sunglasses flashed when she looks at [[G'zraad]].

As he died, we heard screams from the black pools of undead below the anchor tree and goo burst out. His body disintegrated, except for his two golden fingers. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] has his ashes and those fingers.

### Background

[[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] and [[The Matron]] have reason to believe [[G'zraad]] an ilithid of some particular power. She has spoken with other Matrons across the underdark, one of them had records of him. One with the same name lived near another Drow colony underneath [[Tinkate]], about 150 years ago - that's longer than the typical lifespan. They think he split from his colony because of arcane interests that are unacceptable to an elder brain. This means he is likely what is called an [[Alhoon]], based on the magics and altered creatures. They engage in rituals to artificially preserve their lives, some might call them a litch. This is likely in partnership with other ilithid. 

It's likely a powerful caster, while also have strong ilihtid abilities like manipulating a creatures brain, specifically those with weaker intellects. They are rarely martial fighters, but are known to rip the brains out of those they fight. [[Costi]] has learned a lot about liches, and asks if they'll have a phalectory. It's unclear, but they believe an [[Alhoon]] is not true lichdom, but use some minor phalectory, rather than a true one. We ask about the psychic connection, it is a skill of ilithid but typically requires contact. 

### Who're they to us? 
Knew things about [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], as shown in the conversation he had with [[Freya]] during our attempts to [[Heal the Anchor Tree]]: She hears "You can still turn back, [[Freya]] of [[Polaris]]. You can go home, you can go North. I can see you there safely". She responds, "You must know too much, because I can't go home yet". He says, "It was all just a big misunderstanding, we can smooth it over, you can have your family again". She asks "who's we?". He doesn't answer but says "turn back or help me, and all will be revealed. I know they've kept answers from you, I can give them to you. I know it's what you want. I can harness the anger that you feel." She responds, "That will only get me so far, though". He promises, "I can get you further" and she deflect with, "I'll you know" before we pull her off of the root.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] found a [[Githyanki Stone Tablet]] while trying to [[Heal the Anchor Tree]] that read, "On the trail of [[G'zraad]], the Ilithid is separate from it's people. Vulnerable. Likelihood of establishing new elderbrain 19%. Path almost complete" 

[[Hugh]] casts Divination and asks [[TrueSilver]], "Would taking down the Ilithid named [[G'zraad]] be beneficial in our goal of curing the anchor tree?", In the flames [[Hugh]] sees a line of brown begin to take shape, brown craggy fire, as it connects to the ground - at the base a black flame emerge. It expands across the rough brown flame. Standing over top of it, there's a flickering purple shape, arms out-stretched. As it's arms raise the black gets larger. Then it all returns to the usual shape. 

As we [[Heal the Anchor Tree]], we found a hidden panel to see a dark tinted pane of glass, looking closely we see some sigils behind it showing it to maybe be a [[sending panel]] - we fiddle until a message appears. None of us can read it, so we copy it down to read later. After a SR, [[Costi]] reads the message in DeepSpeech saying, 

"[[G'zraad]] - Your progress—finally—is encouraging. Our window appears to be Riventi, do not fail to take advantage of [[Weirefesteria]]’s latent power again. We are most vulnerable in Marcanti; expect a concerted effort to undo your work then. [[Mhrhaal]]’s efforts appear to be moving apace, and mine, as you are well aware, have been established for the last year. Our southern friend and their long-shot attempt has been, unfortunately, unmade. To assist you in your efforts, we have provided one of [[Bhuldikat]]’s spawn; keep it alive. It also bears another gift, it should jumpstart your stalled workings. Do not fail this time, [[G'zraad]]. - [[Sezathkathon]]"

Looking around we find a small underdark wyrmling that had been dissected, it's blind. All of it's inner organs have been fully removed. Must mean that [[Bhuldikat]] is maybe an underdark dragon himself? 

[[Wyn Elreal]] found a gold ring finger similar to [[G'zraad]] gold appendages. [[Wyn Elreal]] killed a humanoid with the finger, and he recognized [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] too. This occurred on a job in [[New Fairhaven]], tied to [[Duke v'Bihor]]'s bastard [[Von]], who seemed to answer to a halfling who also had gold fingers, with many undead.
