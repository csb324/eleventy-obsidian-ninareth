**First impression**: a blonde [[Redscale]] student who attended a [[The Miscasts|Miscasts]] concert at [[The Needle Cushion]] with her two friends. She clearly had an attitude, and was hooking up with the drummer, [[Rian]].

**Second impression**: Some kind of horrible witch creature. Pale skin, stringy hair, deep wrinkles, spooky voice. Her victim, [[Rian]], seemed to have fallen into a troubled sleep. She somehow drew energy from him to animate furniture. 

Upon her death, we found:
1. A little leather bag full of screams
2. A golden diadem on her brow
	1. This can cast sending once per day, 
	2. attuning to it puts you in a spooky witches group chat. 
3. A dog tag on a chain around her neck, with writing none of us know how to read. It was about to melt into her skin when [[Freya]] pulled it out with her talons. 
	1. "auntie darkna" - seems like a name 
	2. "The beauties of shadow" in silvan, a fey language.
