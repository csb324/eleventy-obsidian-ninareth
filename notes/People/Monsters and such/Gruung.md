Purple ones, red ones, and blue ones. They hate [[The Unforged Few]], especially the [[Freya]] the Gruung Slayer. They live in the outside [[Tinzelven]]. Specifically, in the trees.

Bossy little motherfuckers. They want to enslave everybody who isn't gruung, slaves are fed poison -- but juuust a liiittttle

### Color Scheme
* green = hopping poison
	* Their venom is sort of a fun drug -- [[Rez]] and [[Deeksta]] have tried it.
* purple = go to the water 
* orange = 
* blue  = ribbit
* red is middle dangerous = magic casters
* gold is most dangerous, leaders = charmed

### Who're They to Us?
Attacked [[Tinzelven]] in the [[Gruung Attack on Tinzelven]], the [[The Unforged Few]] stopped it. Some by tricking, but mostly by killing them. This has caused some bad blood.

On the way to [[Damien]], they laid an elaborate trap for [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]]. It didn't go how they hoped.
