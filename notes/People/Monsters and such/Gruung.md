# Gruung

Status: seeking veeennnnngaaance 

Purple ones, red ones, and blue ones. They hate [[Our Party]]. And they live in the <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Home</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Vrolbekk Forest]]</span></span> outside [[Tinzelven]]. Specifically, in the trees.

Their hopping venom is sort of a fun drug -- [[Rez]] and [[Deeksta]] have tried it.


* Bossy little motherfuckers. 
* They want to enslave everybody who isn't gruung
* Slaves are fed poison -- but juuust a liiittttle
* green = hopping poison
* purple & blue = go to the water & ribbit (i don't remember which is which)
* red is middle dangerous (magic casters)
* gold is most dangerous (??)
