A coven of hags, we believe, led by [[Threthdia Scrivit]]. We first encountered them when [[The Beauties of Shadow]], a hag, was draining [[Rian]], a member of [[The Miscasts]], of his energy. We killed her, and received a [[Circlet of Sending]] -- which [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] used to connect with the rest of the hags. Doing that revealed our location, and from that point forward [[Threthdia Scrivit]] has been trying to kill [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. She's sent Banderhobbs, Redcaps, *and more* after us.

**First impression**: a blonde [[Redscale]] student who attended a [[The Miscasts|Miscasts]] concert at [[The Needle Cushion]] with her two friends. She clearly had an attitude, and was hooking up with the drummer, [[Rian]].

**Second impression**: Some kind of horrible witch creature. Pale skin, stringy hair, deep wrinkles, spooky voice. Her victim, [[Rian]], seemed to have fallen into a troubled sleep. She somehow drew energy from him to animate furniture. 

Upon her death, we found:
1. A little leather [[Bag of Screams]]
2. A [[Circlet of Sending]] on her brow
	* This can cast sending once per day, 
	* Attuning to it puts you in a spooky witches group chat. 
1. A [[Beauties of Shadow Dog Tag|dog tag]] on a chain around her neck, with writing none of us know how to read. It was about to melt into her skin when [[Freya]] pulled it out with her talons. 
	* *"auntie darkna" - seems like a name 
	* "The beauties of shadow" in sylvan, a fey language.
