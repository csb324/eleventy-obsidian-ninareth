## Bel

Bel has a bit of a crush on [[Innis]]. He's a figher for justice, and he's got his eye on you. He doesn't trust people, and for good reasons.

Tough detective trope, but very small. 

## Klida 
More of a magic user, and more friendly than her brother. 

### Background
A pranking duo (Klida and Bel) who tried to put us to sleep, knocked the wheel off a cart, and then asked for our help. It was basically extortion but [[Rez]] liked their style. 

### Who're they to us?
After we killed their SPEEEDY cousin Mixx, they were grateful and said to hit them up if we passed through again. So, that's nice.

They then followed us to [[Tinzelven]] and eventually [[Jalantar]]. We have promised to help them find their sister, who was kidnapped and lives in a jar somewhere. #mysteries 

Delivered some letters from [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] for [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] in exchange for an equivalent favor down the road

### Notes 
[[session-0]]

In their little grove, we found a [[Wayfinders|wayfinder]] Mixx had killed, and the boxes they were carrying. In those boxes were:

- An immovable rod
- A bunch of broken glass
- A frozen heart??? #mysteries
