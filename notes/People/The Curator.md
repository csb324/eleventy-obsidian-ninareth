A black cloak covers their entirely, hood pulled up well over their hair, a porcelain masks fixed in a small smile covers their face. 

Says they're a “collector” - but we can call them the Curator. Reassures us that they value privacy a great deal. 

Tells us they collect all sorts of things. Doesn’t like to cage things, but prefers to collect them. All they need is for us to keep being interesting. And if we need assistance, they’ll try to assist us. Claims to have many many people all across the continent that are in her collection. 

Implied is that if one of their other ~collectibles~ needs help from us, we're expected to comply. Highly secretive. Says they tries not to act for those in her collection, but wants them to learn to act for themselves -- with their help. 

### Background
Seems to be able to travel by dream, or some other magical means, and has a large capacity to be multiple places. 

### Who're they to us? 
Has been watching our group, and interested in meeting the three of us: [[Rez]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Freya]]. All three of us joined her collection in [[session-30]]. in [[session-30]].

Appeared into [[Freya]]'s room, came specifically to learn secrets. Asks "what is she after? what would she like", says her role is to shepard those in her collectino to be the best they can be. To know their goals to help them become true.

We've run afoul of someone they have a terse relationship with [[Threthdia Scrivit]]. Says their purposes are cross to theirs, and would happy to lend us assistance.

Gave [[Freya]] the [[Curator Quills]], in exchange for her blood while in their various rage-shapes. 


### The Contract
I, \_\_\_\_\_, am excited to join the Collection and do so willingly.

## Important Conversations:

### [[Session-45]]

Cold icy pressure between her shoulder blades wakes [[Freya]], in a totally not overtly concerning way. [[The Curator]] has come to visit. Following-up on [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] efforts to kill [[The Beauties of Shadow]]. They gives a group of test tubes, 3 filled with a small amount of gray liquid, and 3 empty, paired with a thin metal quill -- the [[Curator Quills]]. Each tube is enough for one use, if we need [[The Curator]]'s help, we should just make a mark with the quill. She says the [[The Beauties of Shadow]] may interefer with her magic, but making a mark allows her to temporarily "peirce the veil". The mark can be on whatever [[Freya]] wishes. They says the mark should go wherever she needs assistance the most - but it's implied there could be serious impacts, it's uncertain what those are in advance. They says the Quills are tied to them, and also to the [[The Beauties of Shadow]], and allow them to "step through boundaries". They claims the Beauties been in [[Jalantar]] longer than them. Warns us that [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s house may not look like we expect. 

They also has a favor to ask [[freya]], that those in her collection help each other. They would like to see each of the forms [[Freya]] can turn into, and "take a pinch of each one". After some conversation, they agreed to ask their other subject to destroy [[Freya]]'s blood, and share any results of what they learn from it.  [[The Curator]] gathers the sample in 3 disturbing ways.

As soon as she wakes, [[Freya]] goes to talk to [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] reaches out, and finds the [[Curator Quills]] to feel the same desecrated energy that radites from the mark on [[Freya]]'s back. An identify spell confirms the use of the quills. We chat about this choice, but ultimately, [[Freya]]'s blood is hers to offer if she wants.
