[Class:: [Blood Hunter]]]

Human Female, lighter skinned, seems Taleemian, wearing very nice heavy black armor seems slightly barbed and sword on her hip. Has a necklace tucked into her armor. Has close cropped white hair, and dozens of tiny white scars in a random pattern surrounding her entire neck. Deadpan

### Background
Has rented an air ship through her family connections

Needed to come to [[Jalantar]], found an interesting tome a few years back, but is looking to get more information on it.  

Family from [[Taleem]] but grew up in [[Quaath]]'s Gold Circle. Mom does contract writing for business, Dad helps "procure things" -- gone a lot growing up. Her dad worked with [[Pik]] and [[Pak]]'s father.

Her family is from [[Quaath]] but was from [[Taleem]] originally. They left generations ago and traveled all around [[Ninarith]]. Her grandfather also knew magic, but passed when she was quite young.

Follows [[Arkhosia]] politics quite closely. Says her family, well her parents, well her mom is a merchant.

Once involved with [[Baldred Duvey]]

### Siblings


### Who're They to Us?
Friends with [[Vask]], maybe has something more building with him?

Says she can get us tickets to the [[Bellisime]]. Told [[Vask]] they would either be in [[Jalantar]] for a few weeks, or would have to leave as soon as the [[Bellisme Show]] ends. Uh-oh.

Came to meet [[The Unforged Few]] at the [[The Miscasts]] show

[[Costi]] wants to chat with her about [[The Providers]] and the [[Arkhosian Elections]]
