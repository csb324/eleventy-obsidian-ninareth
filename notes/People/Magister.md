Large warforged, a little bigger than Hugh (about 8â€™ tall). Wearing a black suit with white gloves, very formal. Does not like labels.

Immediately interested in talking with [[Hugh]]. Asked him to write down his thoughts and feelings, in a safe way, to include in the book he's writing about the history of warforged. 

Believes in [[Oghma]] but does not serve her. 

### Background
