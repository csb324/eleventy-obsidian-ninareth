Large warforged, a little bigger than Hugh (about 8â€™ tall). Wearing a black suit with white gloves, very formal. Does not like labels.

Immediately interested in talking with [[Hugh]]. Asked him to write down his thoughts and feelings, in a safe way, to include in the book he's writing about the history of warforged. 

Believes in [[Oghma]] but does not serve her. 

Works in some dunamancy #mysteries 

### Background
Testy about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s warning that [[Hugh]] has some memory loss, defensive about how to talk to or about warforged

From [[Eberron]], says he's had other people help him. Can also cast sending. 

Was part of [[Victoria Several]]'s family, for about 40 years, and was treated well. They found having a servant distatesful. As he gained sentience, the family enocurage his intellectual development, and gave him to option to stay as a partner. Now acts independently and travels with Victoria due to choice, and loyalty. Not obligation. 

About 120 years old.

### Who're They to Us?
Friends with [[Vask]]

Came to meet [[The Unforged Few]] at the [[The Miscasts]] show

Reserved the cigar deck on the roof to introduce [[Hugh]] to [[The Self Made Men]]. Encouraged Hugh to think for himself and value his own desires. 

Says he can help [[Hugh]] repair his memory, and that even if he has had harm done to his brain that he can have his own valid experiences. He is asking about Hugh's experience on his behalf. 

[[Hugh]] wanted to go to [[Eberron]] with him and the [[The Silver Halves]], but was told we're not welcome becuase they're going on a personal and private mission for [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]
