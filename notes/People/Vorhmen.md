A farmer in a small hamlet outside [[Arkhosia (City)]]. He had Spider-guys [[notes-55|eating his crops]], so he hired [[The Unforged Few]] to sort that out. [[notes-56|We did!]] Then we had [[notes-57|dinner]] together.

He was in the 2nd division of the [[Arkhosian Military]], stationed in [[Mulfara]], about 30 years ago.

A glimpse of his sword reminded [[Hugh]] of another sword he remembers seeing -- but the sword [[Hugh]] remembers is an older design.

Vorhmen is a landlord, and a voter - he tends to vote for [[The Providers]], but he isn't heavily engaged.
