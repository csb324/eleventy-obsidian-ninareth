Strange little coward we met in the [[Zhakastin Expedition]] in the [[Turian Waste]] who survived [[Whose Undead is That]] by hiding. Helped us learn about some secret weapons caches, holds no loyalty to his home of [[Gu’athrithen]]. 

Worships [[Oghma]]

Met [[Kaycee Teapetal|Kaycee]] and decided to go back to [[The Shadowfell]] with her. Knows [[Rez]]'s secret.
