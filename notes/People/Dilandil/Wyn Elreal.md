#### Background
Wyn Elreal is a retired fighter who dedicated his service to [[Corellon Larethian]]. He has been living peacefully for two and a half years in the [[The Boundless Grove|Boundless Grove]] after a tumultuous past involving a battle against a widespread undead threat known as [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]. Wyn seems to have experienced significant loss during this time, particularly the loss of his adventuring party and wife.

#### Appearance
Wyn has shoulder-length dark hair with flecks of gray, lighter skin, and a face marked with small scars. He possesses an air of former strength, suggesting a past filled with physical combat, but shows signs of a life more serene in recent years.

#### Encounter with Adrienne
Wyn recently met [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] in the [[The Boundless Grove|Boundless Grove]]. Initially cautious and recording their conversation with a magical device, he eventually turned it off to foster trust. During their interaction, Wyn revealed his knowledge and involvement in significant events including battles against a golden-fingered humanoid and encounters with entities connected to [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]]

#### Connections to Current Events
- **Adrienne's Mission:** Wyn was informed about [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]'s efforts to [[Heal the Anchor Tree]], the involvement of [[G'zraad]], and the resurrection of Adrienne, along with the related elements of undead, necromancy, and time magic.
- **Gold Appendage Inquiry:** He inquired about a gold ring finger, linking it to his past encounterin [[Eberron]], [[Von]], suggesting a connection to [[G'zraad]] and other [[Alhoon]]s - part of the broader [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]
- **Other Groups:** He was updated about other groups working against the undead threat, including [[The Burning Sons]], [[Temper Metal]], and [[Bahamat's Party]].

#### Personal Story
He recounted his history with [[The Boundless Grove|Boundless Grove]], aiding [[Dilandil]] ex-pats, and his involvement in a dangerous mission in [[New Fairhaven]] of the [[Bihor Region]] of [[Eberron]]. This mission involved a confrontation with a group led by a figure named [[Von]], a supposed bastard of [[Duke v'Bihor]], and a harrowing encounter in an underground temple filled with undead and a halfling with gold fingers.

#### Current Status
Wyn Elreal is currently at the [[The Home Tree]].
