### Background
She talks about when she moved to [[Thalfar]] with her two friends, who she also was intimate with, and they all planned to live together. 
One of her friends, [[Shoshata]] who is magnetic and exciting but a bit flighty and [[Esshoui]] a very stable responsible person. [[Jade]] thinks she joined a cult and murdered her neighbor and maybe a lot more. 
On nights with a new moon, which is a big deal there, she was always out with the new friends who seemed very Yuan-Ti Supremicists, didn't like [[Jade]]. 
Her lizardfolk who was a bad neighbor mysteriously disappeared, and when she tried to investigate she learns [[Shoshata]] did this with her new friends as a sacrifice to [[Sseth]], a snake risen-god who wants to eat the world, often worshipped by yuan-ti. They got in a big fight and haven't talked since.
