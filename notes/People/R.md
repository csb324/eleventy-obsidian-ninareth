Sent [[Freya]] a message. The message was to meet [[Akros]] at the [[Jalantar Wayfinders Outpost]]. 

(I feel like Freya has actually told us this person's name --this was the wayfinder she knew in [[True North]], who connected her with the [[Wayfinders]] when she was banished from her community. But Clara forgets the name).
