Older human, short cropped white hair. Very lightly lined face, creases at the top of his mouth. Lightly tanned olive skin, and very light salt and pepper facial hair. Wears a simple blue suit with a red ascot around his neck. Objectively very attractive. He's 77 but looks like his 50's, aging very well. 

Places listening stones, that report anything within 30ft, and can notify us if needed. 

### Background
A shady political maneuver-er. Has been travelling for a while. Seems to have a pretty widespread reputation. 

Went to [[Redscale]] and graduated with [[El'Haliand]]. There is a Runehorn Hall at the school. Says they've been a fixture of Jalantar society, since it's founding. His family estate is few days north of here. 

Claims he makes most of his money collecting art. Says he's going to talk to [[Doha]] about her artistic talent. 

Plans to visit [[Jalantar]] in a few weeks, according to Colonel Finn [[El'Haliand]]. He'll be attending a concert.

Says according to him abour 7% of jalantarians can vote, but he invests in people not political causes. 

### Who's he to us? 
Employs [[Adrienne Spout]], calls her his right hand. Also employs [[Henrik]], and works closely with [[Sienna Burbank]]

Not on good terms with [[Niko]], [[Giary]], [[Srictha]]

Friends with [[El'Haliand]] and colleagues with [[Jenson Davour]]

Offered to have [[Freya]] sit with a historian about [[Polaris]] 

Offered our party introductions, cooperation, and potentially citizenship if we look to stay in Jalantar. Offered [[Costi]] to loan him property so he could vote in the elections. 

Invited us to visit his box at the [[Bellisme Show]] and added our names to the sponsor list. 

Told [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to: 
* make sure [[Hugh]] doesn't cause a scene 
* that [[Freya]] is not around dinners and events than she should be 
* to nuture [[Costi]] as his political feelings could be useful 
* don't be overly publicly associated with [[Rez]] becuase of her frivolous antics

[[Costi]] offered a trade for information about [[Threthdia Scrivit]], he responded that he would ask his own question -- that Costi would have it soon. 
	When he called this in, [[Costi]] had to tell him everything that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was hiding about the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]. Costi told most of it, but kept the [[Fire Raisers]] secret. 

Staying at the [[Guspen Resort]] in [[Jalantar]]

Exchanging a favor from our group to go collect a pipe from [[Damien]], for information on and help with [[Threthdia Scrivit]]
