A member of [[ELA]] who operates in [[Arkhosia (City)]]. [[Costi's mom]] told us he would get in touch with us, and he might have information on [[Costi's Dad]]. At least, he could tell us more about [[ELA]] than we've been able to get in 25 word increments from [[Costi's mom]]. 

We're also hoping he might know something about the [[Fire Raisers]] plans, since they seem to be allied with [[ELA]] in some way.
