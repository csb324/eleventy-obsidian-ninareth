[Home::[[Thelran Asari]]
[Affiliation::[[Wayfinders]]

The [[Roadmaster]] of the [[Wayfinders]] directs operations out of [[Temple of Pelor in Thelran Asari]] and serves on the Council of the city. He's led the organization for 19 years. The leaders of the Outposts vote amongst themselves for the [[Roadmaster]], and once elected you serve for life. [[Gulsindip Desindever]] previously led the [[Thelran Asari Wayfinder Outpost]], and that posting is often seen as a feeder to [[Roadmaster]].
