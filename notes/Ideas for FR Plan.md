* stop the [[Cloud's Lament]] from reaching the city?
* Organize a reason for all of the troops to be centrally located at the [[The Furnance in Arkoshia City]]? plan a single sting while they're all there 
	* pros: fewer get away
	* con: deadlier
* Split up and stop the attacks where they're planned
	* pros: easier to follow the plan they already have in place
	* con: folks might run, if we get the locations wrong we're screwed

How to find info:
* gotta tail or eavesdrop the folks at the [[Fundraiser]]
* [[First Officer Ghent]] intel?
* [[Terrav]] update with plan right before the attack
* [[Pruvki Forgaveat]] conversation at the [[Fundraiser]]
