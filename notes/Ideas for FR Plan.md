* Stop the [[Cloud's Lament]] from reaching the city?
	* intercept the packages or destroy them
	* find out what specifically is being brought
* Organize a reason for all of the troops to be centrally located at the [[The Furnance in Arkoshia City]]? plan a single sting while they're all there 
	* pros: fewer get away
	* con: deadlier
* Split up and stop the attacks where they're planned
	* pros: easier to follow the plan they already have in place
	* con: folks might run, if we get the locations wrong we're screwed
* Stop the [[Delegates Day]] parade? Or diminsh parade route? 
	* increase guard presence regardless
	* pros: can't blow up what's not there
	* cons: tip off could cause the [[Fire Raisers]] to change to something we don't know about
* Locate object to find the bombs (or the fuses?)
	* disable somehow? 

How to find info:
* gotta tail or eavesdrop the folks at the [[Fundraiser]]
* [[First Officer Ghent]] intel?
* [[Terrav]] update with plan right before the attack
* [[Pruvki Forgaveat]] conversation at the [[Fundraiser]]
