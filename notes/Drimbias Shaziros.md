Wrote an autobiography about her time traveling the planes - she called herself a plane-drifter. She died about 200 year ago. 

Some believe she had high-elven lineage, which is rare since almost all of them died. Some possible lineages are:
* the family of [[Stalwart Mudd]], who became too diluted 
* [[Seravana]] who died in the [[The Three Dragons War]]
* [[Valcano]] who is believed to be killed. 
* [[Morthos]]? [[Magister]] believes he was a high-elf

She claims to have been born on the [[City of Brass]] on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].

### Who're They to Us?
[[Caleb Schleuse]] found [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] in her autobiography.
