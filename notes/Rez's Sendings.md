# [[Rez]]'s Sendings

- [[Father Thronestone]] - 
	- Hi! good to hear from ya. Yes, reinstated, happily, I might add. Haven't checked, I'll say hi. No update yet - soon.
		- Need everything you've found in [[Burru Ilp]]'s notes. If you are not finished, make it your top priority. Please. This is more serious than you know.
			- I’m nearing competition, I can largely be done by the end of the week. How can I transmit?
* [[Ghez Yhutl]] - 
	* What a curious folio (it's Rez!) Any update from my favorite spy? I'm in [[Arkhosia (City)]], doing my own searching. Make [[Azir DarAxia|Saint Goldborn]] proud Ghez!!
		* Oh hey there Rez! It's so great to hear from you! Did you have a good trip? Yeah, I've looked into things, and have a…
	* "Ghez! GREAT JOB. Are you discovered? Need ALL THE INFO. How're you getting to [[Thelran Asari]]? You can meet my sister there. Copperscales is PERFECTION."
		* "Another operative - great. Contact please. Discovered kind of, plan went sidewise. Little bit wanted. Stowed away on airship. Arrived yesterday. Totally fine, [[Divitston Goldstone]] says hi"
			* "Norris Park, that satyr fountain, tomorrow morning. Her codename is Silverscales. Tell her everything, and listen to what she says. Letters to [[Wayfinders]] in [[Quaath]]"
	* Ghez!! Can you talk to [[Bahamut]]? Have you tried? Do you know who can write it down? Also how are you?? You're so cool now 
		* Hey!!! Your sister is SO GREAT! Almost as great as you (almost). Are you coming to see us soon? We’ve learned more about those circles and
			* YES soon! You're in [[Durmask]]? Also WHAT DID YOU LEARN? 25. Words. Ghez. Also [[Bahamut]] talks?? (and yes [[Eirian|E]] is fine, don't forget your favorite)
				* Ugh sorry thought had five more words. [[Bahamut]]: No. Tried: Just did, still no. [[Freya's Mysterious Letter|Mysterious Circles]]: [[Samson]] met guy knew about, but just found him dead.
					* Can you tell me more about this guy? Who was he? How'd he die? Why do you think he was tied to the circles? DETAILS! 
						* Don’t know! He some merchant, think sold books, [[Samson]] just heard him mention it, was gonna get coffee, then guy turned up dead shortly after! 
- [[Vask]] - 
	- I’M IN YOUR HEAD!! HI!!!! So [[Zalev]] might be safe, might not - go home or away maybe? Oh, oops I’m in [[Jalantar]] not [[Tinzelven]] so…
		- We’re already on the way to [[Jalantar]]! I made some friends and they have MONEY! We should be there in a few days, airships speedy.
	* Vask. I found [[Gin]]. She’s in there! I heard her!! We killed everyone - but I couldn’t take her. Basement, Tiamat house, Fallsides. Meet me there dawn?
	* E is on it, she’ll take care of it. I’m the best! 
	* Vask!! Going to squish a big eyeball. If anti-magic ray outs me I'll BE SO MAD - tips? Also, could [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] get us into [[Halls of the Dead]]?
		* Hahahahaha, GOOD LUCK! Looks like I'll be winning this year. But seriously, be careful. Stay behind a rock or something. And probably! I'll ask.
	- [[Nehushta]] is dead. [[Zmaj]] is going to [[Durmask]]. You're okay? I laughed. I got the message on my bracelet and I laughed
		- What? No. Weird joke from [[Zmaj]], maybe? No way something happened to [[Nehushta|Neti]]. I'll be there soon.
	- How was home? You out of [[Zalev]]? [[Eberron]] sucks. Found info -- [[Olvadra Sunderhorn]], dwarf from [[K'falgaard|Kfalgaard]]. Killed [[Gin]], founded [[Boulder Makers]]? With [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], where're you?
		- ​​Home was fine, nothing to report, thank [[Bahamut]]. Also in [[Eberron]], not that bad! Outside [[Jezeten]], great trout. Looking into [[Olvadra Sunderhorn]], asking [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and [[Magister]]. Will update.
	- VASK!! Tell me WHY we can't go back to our lair??? Is this a decade or a CENTURY problem?? *sigh* ... Pretty funny to fly though
		- Hehehe. Just a few months, probably! Don't freak out, someone broke in. Problem taken care of, nothing gone. But it got a bit...messy. Oops.
			- Thief or..? But nice - slipping away uncaught!! (right?) Scryed on [[[Pleetos Alentas]], siblings on it. [[Eirian|E]]'s got a mystery island. [[New Fairhaven]]?? Gods need help apparently? 
				- Attempted thief! And I was briefly caught, but got un-caught. No witnesses. Rest of that confused me, use your words Rez! Talk soon.
					* [[Freya]] has a book from some [[Wayfinders]] with code into it and we've cracked part of it and it says [[Moradin]], [[Pelor]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Bahamut]] need help from dragons!! THEN [[Hugh|Finn]] divined with his god [[TrueSilver]] who confirmed it! At least *some* [[Wayfinders]] want to help. Enough words?? Seems serious.
						- Smartass. Wait how is that related to the mystery island? And [[Pleetos Alentas]]? Is he on [[Eirian|E]]'s mystery island? And how did she get an island? Is that island close to [[New Fairhaven]]? But anyway, this does seem like a big deal, we'll be there in a few weeks probably! Lots of treasure hunters gathering, secrets galore. Someone will know something
	- ​​Hey so - have you done anything with the [[ELA]]?? I mean, your reputation might proceed you. Somehow I'm sort of becoming a freedom fighter? 
		- You, fighting for the little folk? Unsurprised. There were some folks I helped in a fight in [[Jezeten]] a few months back, maybe were [[ELA]]?
	- Soooo, did you fuck with [[Gu’athrithen]]? And do you know anything about undead in the [[Turian Waste]]? Cause now I gotta go investigate and save blues??? 
		- Not recently! That wasn’t us, I don’t think. All the undead we saw we killed. Can you do a bad job and kill them instead?
			- I will TOTALLY try!! Also. I need some of our money. Not a lot. Like, 2k gold? I need to take care of some people. 
	- I found an INCREDIBLE piece of art, we HAVE to own. 930 GP, it's of [[Serana Veraxyes]], she SAT. [[Rez's Dad]] would love... or we keep it :)
		- Done
	- So you're definitely not in love with [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] right? I mean, so silly right? But like, are you catching feels for a MORTAL?
		- Hahaha, love?! I mean, she’s definitely more interesting than any other mortal ever. Something unique about her, she’s really special and fascinating. But love?! Ha. *(DM: He sounds upbeat and like, super normal about it. But as you play it back in your head, there’s a tiny little measure of… forcedness. Very small, and maybe you’re just making it up because this has been weird exchange, you really aren’t sure.)*
	- Vask... [[Zoheret|Zoha]]. I think we've been wrong, I think we've underestimated all of them. We don't need to be alone. Don't leave your group, okay? 
		- [[The Silver Halves]] are making a detour to [[Durmask]]. I’ll put bullet in half the city if must. You keep on your mission, though, [[Zmaj]] is right. *(DM: He’s sincere sounding, not being an asshole)*.
	- “From [[Vask]], where are you Rez this isn’t funny respond right now I’ll be there Rez, Rez, Rez, please, Rez?”
	- [[Unscaled]]'s notes codebroken!! Headquarters near [[Yent Lake]], [[Fenswick Cove]]?? We'll 5/6 weeks. We should raze it. Can you come? We're killing the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] tomorrow!
		-  Ahhh!!!! You’re a little too early, we’ll be in [[Jezeten]] in three weeks! Good luck, and yeah, want a ride to [[Yent Lake]]? Shoot stuff.
			* [[Vask]] I SO DO. Same scales / same brain.
	* THE [[Amulet of the Planes]] FROM [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] is a plane shift amulet that's tied to [[The Shadowfell]]l!! We could TOTALLY go see mom! 
		* Ohhhhhhh cool!!! I miss mom!
	* MANDATORY sibling night on the town tomorrow!! You gotta meet this weird little guy [[Eirian]]'s messing around with. He's working for Aunt [[Gemma]]! 
		* WAIT REALLY?!? I WANNA ASK HIM LOTS OF QUESTIONS. I’m in.
- [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] -
	- deal for large quantities of diamonds?
		- Said yes as long as we have money
	- Hi!! Thanks for the diamonds. Didn't need them but you never know. How's the inventing going? Still got that [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] rift? Just curious.
		- Excellent! Earth plane diamond has fueled a FASCINATING energy magnifier I’ve used to improve robot. It has lasers now! Yep, have that rift, it ROCKS, ha!
			- hahahaha, good one. Oh cooool! How'd you do that? Won't make any robots but could be neat to magnify some of our spells or stuff!
				- It takes some SERIOUS doing. You’d need a chassis, a number of other reagents. I could teach if you spent a few months with me!
- [[Eirian]] - 
	- Hey! [[Pleetos Alentas]], rune crafter at [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]]. [[Galaphanel]] CULTIST. Brass scales melded to him (from who???). [[Moradin]] temple searching - don’t be caught. Find and interrogate? 
		- Ah, need my help? Happy to fly in for the rescue. Also, gross. I’ll handle it, thanks for letting me know. Will update.
	- Any luck? Some “fly in to the rescue” hmm?
		- Still working on it, he got spooked, went underground. It's well in hand, you focus on not blowing the game again. Maybe it's finally your year…
	- E - I've got a spy, he's just made it to TA. [[Ghez Yhutl]]. In the Order, surprisingly finding a lot. He's wanted now. Good luck!
		- If he's deadweight, I'm telling everyone you have bad taste. Set a meeting time and place, I'll hear him out.
			- Norris Park, that satyr fountain, tomorrow morning. Tell him you have a curious folio. He'll probably call me copperscales. E. I'd NEVER have bad taste.
	- How are you? Ghez? Have you heard of a guy named [[Rughork]]? He apparently summoned devils to try and kill us because he's 'displeased'. Coward.
		- It’s been busy, but no, that name is new. We’ll look into it, any other details helpful.
	- Found [[Rughork]]. He's nobody? The scapegoat. Pleeeeeeeasssee shake him down for info? Or [[Ghez Yhutl]]! The Ladies Breath, half-orc, dishwasher. Double his payment. Any other updates?
		- Sure, we’ll bring the group. I want to see what [[Samson]] can handle. I’ll report back tomorrow night or the day after.
			- Hey, I had a great idea! What time are you going? My warforged will scry. Also these humans are CURIOUS. Smarter than I realized too…
				- Sure, 8:35 PM tonight. Sounds like someone is going to lose again….
	- UHM E?? Updates? That Samson guy looks like a STORY. Uhm.. mostly waiting on answers from you while being super cool and important NOT losing. 
	    - He is a trip! Got a surprise for you about him… Took longer than anticipated, found [[Rughork]] late last night. Dead, was out of spells. 
			- Well now you've GOT to tell me. Also dead? Unlucky bastard. Any clues on who hired him? Any ties to others? 
				- Not until you get to TA! Best guess: was intermediary for a demonologist hired by the person actually mad at [[Costi]]. Tracks covered well.
	- E. Scryed [[Pleetos Alentas]] in [[Narathian Plains]] (x) days ago. Please be careful. Get a sibling with you. Are [[Simin]] and [[Taji]] still in [[Durmask]]? 
		- Yes, [[Simin]] and [[Taji]] were with the others yesterday. They won’t leave until after the counterattack, I’ll come to you tonight with more details.
	- They didn’t get you too, did they? Rez, are you okay? This is a rough time for one of your pranks.
		- I'm alive!!! I'm with MOM, I'm sorry!! I'm OKAY
	- [[Unscaled]]'s notes codebroken!! Headquarters near [[Yent Lake]], [[Fenswick Cove]]?? DON'T GO. I'll be there with my people in 5/6 weeks. Look out.
		- Think you can make it faster? Nervous they’ll leave soon. We’ll loosely scout it out.
			* Turns out yes! Three weeks? I have SUPER important things going on but I have much more information I’ll tell you with more sendings later
	*  E!!! [[Vask]] and I land tomorrow morning! Should we stay with you?? I'm bringing my people but Vask is leaving his behind. Soooo 6?
		* Let me see what we have roomwise, but regardless we'll meet you at the Point! I cannot WAIT to see you.
	* Hey - have you spent much time at the Platinum Sanctuary here?? Think they've been infested too or are they clear? I'm going today! Unless no?
		* Since Jalantar, I've stayed away just in case. Figured we'd go back once we knew who to cart out. Assume someone is compromised, at least.
- [[Taji]] - 
	- How're you liking your human body? Better love it since you'll be stuck for 100 years! GG's, better luck next game! (oh - hi to kiddos!)
		- Fuck off, Rez.
- [[Rez's Dad|Azir]] - 
	- Hey Dad!! You'd be SO proud, I made my own adventuring group! I lost one, Auntie A will help. Who was that orange Tropics firbolg?
- [[Aedara Alinar|Aedara]] -
	- Hello Auntie A! We saved [[Arkhosia (City)]]! You'd be proud. Would've been easier with Adrienne though. Can you help? [[Quaath]] in Hulfni. She's maybe [[Corellon Larethian]] oracle? 
		- I'll do what I can do. Be patient, my child. Life is long, and we will find her if we can.
	- BIG NEWS - I'm totally patient but, we're under [[Weirefesteria]]. We think [[Corellon Larethian]] sent us for Adrienne, other gods also sent people? Anchor tree is target? 
		- That explains a great deal. I'm happy to hear you have this handled, and will assist if I can. Be careful who you trust.
	- Hiiii!! Guess what we found?? A [[Shard of Maguebliet]]! Some mummy guy had it? We're taking it to the [[Niraani Sisterhood]]. Just seems like something you'd care about, if you want it! Also never mind, I got my person back, she's fine now. Oh ALSO, have you heard from [[Azir DarAxia|Rez's Dad]]?
		- Disturbing, didn't know mummy with [[Shard of Maguebliet]], but [[Niraani Sisterhood]] should have it. See it safely there. Have [[Zmaj]] investigate, please, and tell [[Li]]. Glad person is fine. No, haven't spoken to [[Rez's Dad|Azir]] in...some time. Unclear how much. Is there reason to be concerned? If so, can investigate further.
			- I mean, I'm sure he's fine, it's DAD. It's just NO ONE has in a few decades? I want to tell him there's some people targeting us. They killed Neti and Zoha. We're handling that soon though!! And Bahamut maybe needs help? But we're also totally handling that. I think.
				- Thank **you** for telling me [[Rez]], I appreciate it. This is concerning, and I'll be speaking to the others."
- [[Kaycee Teapetal|Kaycee]]
	- Hi Mom!! I found a shard of the shadowfell - tell [[Mr. Blueberry]] hi!! Hope you're killing many things but don't worry things are good here.
		- You hear a deep, rumbling voice echoing back in your head, "Kaycee's a little busy right now, but I'll be sure to pass the message along."
- [[Zmaj]]
	- [[Nehushta]] is dead. I don't know what happened. Traveling to [[Durmask]] to find more information. Be careful, sister.
	- Any update?? Found info -- [[Olvadra Sunderhorn]], dwarf from [[K'falgaard|Kfalgaard]]. Killed [[Gin]], founded [[Boulder Makers]]? More undead apparently in [[New Fairhaven]], plan to deal with soon.
		- Sending [[Zoheret|Zoha]] and [[Zalvaris|Zalv]] to [[K'falgaard|Kfalgaard]]. No additional updates. Excellent work, proud of you.
	- [[Zoheret]] and [[Zalvaris]] are on their way to [[Durmask]]. [[Simin]] and [[Taji]] are here now. We'll handle this. Focus on your tasks, and be careful.
	- I'm the best. Scryed on [[Pleetos Alentas]], he's sailing - maybe [[Lake Delente]]? Drinking wine, the fuck. Tan half-elf, dark ponytail. Eyes flashed DRACONIC RED. You're welcome.
		- Sigh. Thank you, Rez, for your excellent work. [[Zalvaris|Zalv]] and [[Zoheret|Zoha]] will investigate.
	- Soooo, one of my mortals can talk to their god. Do you talk to [[Bahamut]]?? Can you teach me? No real reason but also... it's important 
		- No, that’s not in my list. [[Li]] might be able to, though. Also, why? There’s always a reason with you.
			- Don’t worry about it, I’ve got it handled. Kay thanks byeeeeee
				- REZ WE AREN’T DONE HERE.
	- [[Pleetos Alentas]] in [[Narathian Plains]]. Sent [[Zoheret|Zoha]] to minion - [[Bhula Orbnose]], likely halfling, lives in "?23 STREET NAME" [[Durmask]]. Any updates? Talked to [[Li|Igolide]] - tell you eventually!! 
		- She told me, we’re together, and we’re putting together a plan. Striking within the week.
	- Things went wrong, [[Zoheret|Zoha]]’s dead. [[Bhula Orbnose]] prepared, with twelve [[Boulder Makers]]. Killed eleven (not [[Bhula Orbnose]]), had to retreat but the fuckers killed [[Zoheret]]… I’m sorry, Rez.
		- How? They're just, mortals, right?? Maybe we shouldn't keep trying. Or only together? I don't understand how this is happening. You're okay? This cannot continue. 
			- They got [[Zoheret|Zoha]] immediately, and they escaped before we could kill them all. We underestimated, they’re extremely dangerous. Must be more prepared next time. Out spells.
				- I can't believe it's come to this - but fuck [[The Game]]. If I need to come there, I will. We come first. Don't be alone.
					- No. Your work too important, world is in jeopardy. I am convinced. Fuck [[The Game]], but keep the mission. What [[Rez's Dad]] would want. Send again.
						- Finding more - tied into [[Morthos]], undead. Tracking down intel that maybe [[Bahamut]] is in trouble too -- needs our help. I am worried too. In the [[Turian Waste]] now, tied to the problem. [[Alhoon]] related too? Should we convene everyone? I could go to [[Li]]
							* Follow your current course. But… They had pieces of brass…[[Nehushta|Neti]]. Used her to empower spells, frighteningly strong. We will kill them all, Rez.
	- [[The Game]] is yours to win. You’ll see my name on the bracelet soon, but I’m fine. Calling in reinforcements. Good luck, sis. 
	- Rez, what happened? Report back immediately, are you safe? We can send the silvers to you.
		- I'm alive!!! I'm with MOM, I'm sorry!! I'm OKAY
	- [[Unscaled]]'s notes codebroken!! Headquarters near [[Yent Lake]], [[Fenswick Cove]]?? We'll 5/6 weeks I'll be there with my people in 5/6 weeks. We should raze it.
		-  Deal. Let’s drive these fucks into the ground. [[Thelran Asari]] owes us, I’ll meet you there.
	- MANDATORY sibling night on the town tomorrow!! Don't be a grump.  Bring [[Zalvaris]] — he needs it. [[Eirian|E]] knows where.
		- We’ll see. There’s still plenty of work to do, but if things go well I can stop by.
- [[Ravona Silentreed]]
	- Hi! It's Rez! Are you in [[Dilandil]] still? If so, I have a favor to ask you please (yes, you can tell him it's fine)
		- I'm so sorry for your loss. [[Zmaj]] left quickly to investigate and said he'd call for us if he needed us. But I can help!
- [[Bahamut]]
	- You're supposed to be the best of us, which means you have to be pretty damn cool. How do you need help? I'll do it! 
- [[Li]]
	- It's REZ!! In your HEAD!! Hope you're having fun staring at the [[Turian Waste]] watching for blues. One of my mortals talks to their god. Do you talk to [[Bahamut]]? Can you teach me?? (Also if you heard anything about [[Vask]] near you, I wasn't there. If you haven't... never mind) 
		- God’s busy, Rez. Too busy for silly games. If you’ve a message of import, I’ll potentially send. Direct communion requires more seriousness than you possess.
			- You're such a stick in the mud I almost didn't even tell you and you'd have REALLY REGRETTED IT [[Li]] but I guess I'M the BIGGER DRAGON HERE and will put [[Bahamut]] OVER MY OWN SELFISH PETTY NEEDS (send raspberry).  I think [[Bahamut]] needs help (or protection maybe) from us. Along with [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Pelor]]. I think it might have to do with the EXCELLENT IMPORTANT work I'm doing fighting undead guys and saving [[Aedara Alinar|Auntie A]]'s favorite tree. DOES THAT COUNTS AS "a message of import" and is "serious" enough for you?? BUT YOU WOULDN’T KNOW BECAUSE YOU’RE MEAN.
				- I apologize for causing you emotional distress, that was not my intention. You have displayed remarkable emotional maturity in recent years, particularly in past months. I was under some significant stress, but that does not excuse treating you as less than. I will ask [[Bahamut]] if he needs our assistance.
					- ... thanks. I guess I'm sorry I yelled. (you can make it up to me, I'll send you prank ideas and YOU CAN’T SAY NO NOW)
						- I will always and forever reserve the right to say no to a Tanin prank. Remember Eamonspike? But I’m interested…
	- So undead in the [[Turian Waste]] too?? [[Eberron]] sending us to investigate - blues attacked. They're threatening war? You good?? Did [[Bahamut]] answer? Might see you soon!! 
		- Yes. [[Gu’athrithen]] and [[Eberron]] warring is not my concern, your involvement complicates that. Engage as limitedly as possible. [[Bahamut]]’s answer was minimal, waiting for more.
	- This is worse than we thought. Should we convene? Wyrmlings should be hidden. Where's [[Kulta]]? Have you talked [[Bahamut]]? We must act. Don't be alone.
		- Wyrmlings are already hidden and protected in [[Quaath]]. [[Kulta]] tracking a lead on [[Rez's Dad]]. [[Bahamut]], aware, but engagement opportunities are limited. Do not be rash, Rez. 
	- I’m sending agents to your location immediately, don’t move. Respond if you aren’t in danger.
		- I'm alive!!! I'm with MOM, I'm sorry!! I'm OKAY
	-  "I FOUND ONE OF [[Tiamat]]'S SCALES. Scumbag in [[Jezeten]], seems defunct? BUT we shouldn't let this be, right?? 97k. [[Vask]] and I kinda... need money?"
		- "Name and location, please. I'll see to it, we'll handle it subtly."
			- "Fine. But I get to keep it for a while, FINDER'S KEEPERS. [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]], *address*, in the basement. Go quick, he's in trouble soon."
				- "Good work."
	- "It has been taken care of"
		- "And on the way to my riiiiiight?"
			- "It will be taken care of in [[Deregheir]]"
- [[Samson]]
	- I'm Rez! Welcome!! You know my sister, [[Eirian|E]]! You sound so interesting, I have a bunch of questions but FIRST - can you tell me what you know about [[Freya's Mysterious Letter|Mysterious Circles]] and the guy you found dead? You heard him talk about them? You can tell me whatever you tell her!!! 
		- Rez, it is SO nice to meet you! I’ve heard so much, YOU sound so interesting. I hope we get to meet soon! Shoot, that’s a lot to unpack. [[Lorvak Nestle]], bookseller in [[Thelran Asari]], looking for something for my daughter and found book with [[Freya's Mysterious Letter|Mysterious Circles]]! Planned a coffee to talk, but he died before. Found his body, seemed murdered.
- [[Trisha]]
	- Where are you? Y'all have really gotten yourselves in trouble. What did they take from you?? If something's wrong with the [[Turian Waste]] we should know
		- Pods to [[Jezeten]], Draconics broke your controls. Relates to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]’s work, undead in [[Turian Waste]], dragons blame [[Eberron]]. Not the plan, but could work for us.
	- I'm calling in a favor, because I trust you. Did your family find anything on the group [[Boulder Makers]]? Need information: leadership, members, locations... anything.
		- Not yet, but we’ve been focused on the domestic plan. We’re spread thin, but this feels urgent? Need me to break glass? 
			- Yes. Or at least, someone trustworthy needs to. For anything notable, the sooner the better. Don't need history, need where to find -  how to kill.
				- Okay, we’re on it.
- [[Zoheret|Zoha]] (Zoheret) 
	- It's REZ! I'm in your head! [[Pleetos Alentas]] minion - [[Bhula Orbnose]], likely halfling, lives at "?23 STREET NAME" [[Durmask]]. Get any info? Then kill that insect.
		- You got sending? This is apocalyptic…. On it, we’ll find out more, report back, and send you a trophy. Good job, sis.
- [[Krarrhec]]
	- Another has fallen. [[Bhula Orbnose]]. What have you found? Have you interrogated [[Yhridex]]? [[Nikander Vhegohl]]? Found further traitors? Do not underestimate -- mutilating scales for power. 
		- I’ve spoken to [[Li]] already. My sincere condolences, Rez. Have been monitoring [[Nikander Vhegohl]], seized him after attack. Interrogating now. [[Yhridex]] was with [[Bhula Orbnose]], also escaped.
- [[Magister]] - 
	- From [[Vask]], where are you Rez this isn’t funny respond right now I’ll be there Rez, Rez, Rez, please, Rez?
		- I'm alive!!! I'm with MOM, I'm sorry!! I'm OKAY
- [[Simin]] -
	- You just got out, right? We can commiserate over a pint, right? Come on Rez.
		- I'm alive!!! I'm with MOM, I'm sorry!! I'm OKAY
- [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]
	- "Hi! I have a gift for you!! Well, I could buy it and you could help? A BLOOD MAGIC SWORD, Krummyr’s Screaming, in fact. 39,000?"
		- "Sure, that works. We should come into some money in two days."
- [[Zalvaris]]
	- MANDATORY sibling night on the town tomorrow!! Force [[Zmaj]] to come. We'll wipe the rest of them from existence afterwards.
		- That sounds perfect, [[Rez]]. A night out with the coppers is exactly what I need right now.
