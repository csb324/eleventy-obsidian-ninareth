# Krummyr's Screaming Sword

This sword can only be attuned by a blood hunter, and contains a sliver of every soul it kills. When touched intentionally by a non-blood hunter, they must make a DC 19 Con save or take 8d8 necrotic damage, or half on a success. Add +3 to all attack and damage rolls made by this weapon, along with 3d8 necrotic damage. Additionally, it contains six charges that can be expended either on an attack or by using a bonus action. The charges are regained when you use this sword to kill another creature. 

* Steal Life. You may drain vigor from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points. Bleed. You may force a sliver of soul into a creature on an attack, dealing an additional 2d8 force damage. 
* Query Soul. You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic. 
* Borrow Experience. You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul’s life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don’t use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost. 
* Eyes of the Dead. You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you’re currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.
