ELA Day

We learn about the [[ELA Day of Action]], that they have multiple attacks happening at once, with their less skilled, to divert away of getting their most dangerous in to kill a top target. Who will depend on access: the [[Jehneim Bastienev]], [[Teld]], [[Nacrissa Thrudec]], or [[Cliff Burbank]]. They hope this chaos and loss of infrastructure will lead to some devolution of their power. First, they'll clamp down, putting a lot of pressure on the general public (which while hard) will hopefully lead to broader uprisings. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] leads with a suggestion that tension between the [[Eberronian First Division]] and [[Eberronian Second Division]] could bring an opportunity, that targeting primarily the [[Eberronian Second Division]] would lead to infighting. They like the idea, and mention their agents in both armies they could use here. 

[[Costi]] gets a naturally good read on [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]], he seems remorseful, but more over he seems like an academic, caught on the theory of cause and reaction. 

Attacks:
* 7 days - In the catacombs under the stormwall district, there's a number of undead experiments and vampire spawn. The people from the buildings there keep them fed. They're exploring them currently, and looking at the option of releasing these creatures but ensuring they're funneled to specific points and drawing guards there. They plan to put several strong fighters there to contain any escapees.
	* They'd stage additional events, protests and property damage to draw the guards there
	* [[Jehneim Bastienev]] is leading the undead experiments
* ready - Attack guard outposts to cripple responses and draw military into the stormwall
* ready - Destroy two of the gates into the city 
	* Immediately leak to [[Slavaadi College]] the gates are down to draw attention and create real threat (they think they'd be able to repair them before the College arrives)
	* Draw the best to spend their time repairing these gates so that those who will be working within the city will be more aggressive
* ? - Kill the highest ranking member they can, sending [[Niko]] as a sniper. They're tracking their whole list of targets
* Calling in [[ELA]] forces from other areas, think their numbers will end up about 1,000 available fighters, 45 are of a high caliber. 
* Potentials:
	* evacuate building and then blow them up, leaving an area vulnerable to a storm

We ask if there's a particular day this has to happen, they're  worried the longer they wait, the more of them will die. They agree to try and let the timing be guided by us if we have another suggestion or plan in motion. They need at least a week.
