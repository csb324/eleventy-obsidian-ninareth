[[Jenson Davour]] to [[Rez]]
thanks again for the other night, the guys and I appreciate it. We’ll be playing another show but in the meantime we’d like to have you to dinner, let us know when works

Ps everyone else is invited too, this isn’t just for you, they also helped

Pps that Giari guy owes me 20gp, he over-indulged 

[[Rez]] message to [[Vask]]
Hey Vask, things are CRAZY, I’m in Jalantar, I saw the Miscasts again, they’re getting SO GOOD, and I made new friends — you’d really like them, I’ll have to have them meet you maybe we’ll come to Zalev soon, oh also can you swing by home home when you get a chance? No one’s been there for a while and I think it would be good if you left soon and spent time there instead of in our apartment, WAIT EVEN BETTER after you do that come to Tinzlevon like RIGHT AWAY so you can meet my new friends but be cool you know what I mean kay thanks hope you’re having fun but not as much fun as me, byeee

Notes of Favor from [[Willen Guruden]] to [[Rez]] and [[Hugh]]
“Help them out, W.G.”
