### Background
Surrendered by one of [[Damien]]'s undead to help pay down his debt to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. 

### How to Use
While attuned, it's wearer is resistant to fire damage until you activate the secondary ability. 

When activated, you can use an action to cast the spell Agnozars Scorcher, once per day. Once cast, you are no longer resistant to fire damage. 

At dawn, it regains use.
