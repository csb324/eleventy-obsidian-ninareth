When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.  
  
If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.  
  
Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2) if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and [constructs](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/CategoryIndex:Monsters?expansion=0#toc_3) succeed on the saving throw automatically.  
  
An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.  
  
If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.  
  
While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.

### The Cells

3- a ghostly haze crosses the mirror and stepping through it is a wild eyed half-elf in what was once very fine clothing, a uniform of some sort. He used to live in a house in city with big towers, [[Thelran Asari]]. He asks if we know his daughter, but can't remember her name. She was very small, with long red hair, and a freckle (or a mole? or a scar?). He remembers they just stopped the [[The Three Dragons War]]. He was cleaning up and ended up stuck, he gets desperate asking about how long it's been and [[Rez]] panicks that we're going to break his little brain and calls the next cell forward. When [[Costi]] transforms again to [[Sheske Eeping]] to talk to him, he seems panicked and concerned for where we went. He seems to remember the sky

7- a large creature comes up to the surface, a large humanoid covered in short brown bristles with a short snout and two huge horns. It's wearing [[Eberronian Military]] battle armor. [[Hugh]] recognizes it as high high-ranking armor. [[Costi]] recgonizes it was retired 90 years ago. He aks when it is, we tell the truth. We learn her name is [[General Ilka Korsas]], [[Costi]], [[Hugh]], and [[Jade]] all immediately recognize the name. She was a general from [[Eberron]] who led an elite unite called the [[Horned Horrors]], if they accepted a non-minotaur they were grafted horns to their head. She vanished about 113 years ago, believed to have been killed in an unprovoked attack from the [[Slavaadi College]], which led to 3 years of war. She's a controverisal figure even among [[Eberron]]. [[Jade]] knew rumors that she was never really killed.

11- the mirror starts it's typical swirl then goes almost black, we see the color shifting and the black goes to red skin. [[Costi]] tries speaking in infernal and it changes it's breathing, and walks away when [[Jade]] tries abyssal. Definitely a devil.
