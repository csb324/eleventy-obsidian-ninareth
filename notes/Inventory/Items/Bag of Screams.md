A leather bag of stitched human leather from Jecka’s hip that won’t open, but has the sound of screams inside.

Inside this bag there is one evil soul, that is waiting inside to be sacrificed. Don’t know the identity of the soul, but do know it was corrupted before it died, which is the only kind of soul that can be held by the bag.

### Updates
Showed to [[Father Thronestone]] who offered to destroy it for 100 GP
