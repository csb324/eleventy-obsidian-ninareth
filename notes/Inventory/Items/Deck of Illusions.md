# Deck of Illusions
A magical deck of cards with a small piece of paper attached to it that reads "For Isabelle".

Missing 10 cards
	9 of diamonds
	ace of spades
	2 of clubs
	10 of clubs
	9 of hearts
	10 of diamonds
	4 of hearts
	1 joker
	6 of clubs
	king of hearts

Cards must be drawn at random, using  one action and range of 30ft. 

The illusion appears and remains until dispelled. You can use an action within 120ft to magically  move within 30ft of the card.

Any interaction reveals it as illusion, DC 15ft investigation check to see through.
