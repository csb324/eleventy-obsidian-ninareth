Item

Should be Unpleasant to hold, covered in rough bark, but it softens under your fingertip 

Body of harp is warm 

Rounded piece at the top that draws my attention 

Pull itself out
LONDSWORD
made of wood (polished, bright!! polished yew) 
Razor sharp vines running around the longsword’s body 

While attuned to this harp, its wielder can use it as a +1 shield. 
Once per day, you may cast each of the following spells: 
Fly, cure wounds (3rd level), Protection from Good and Evil. 

You may draw the Yew Blade, which is a +2 longsword that can deal either bludgeoning or slashing damage, to the harp or return it to the harp as a bonus action. 

Whenever you cast a spell while wielding the Yew Blade, you may add a number equal to the spell slot expended to your next weapon attack to either the attack or damage roll. (q: before or after rolling attack?)

You may also expend one bardic inspiration die to damage rolls made while attuned to Songswarden’s Solace. 

Additionally, if you use your action to cast a spell, you may use your bonus action to make one weapon attack with the Yew Blade. You may do this twice daily and expended uses are recovered on a long rest.
