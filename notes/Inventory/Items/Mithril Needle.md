It's about a foot long, probably. Very shiny. 

[[Hugh]] first saw this needle in a divination attempt -- it was described as platinum-looking, and as it stabbed into a coal, the coals ignited and then the flames became almost liquid, pooling like blood. 

We assumed this was a metaphor.

Later, after we killed [[Winifey]], we found an empty box on her. The box had an indentation roughly this size and shape.

Minutes later, we saw [[Cinder]] holding something similar... and he used it to create a [[There's Plainly Something Wrong with the Planes|rift of some kind between planes]].

### Updates
[[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] thinks this was used to open a portal to the [[Plane of Fire]] and drew enough energy to create a large amount of [[refined firestone]]. Those boxes were sent to specific locations in [[Baldur]], [[Brask]], and [[Eberron]].
