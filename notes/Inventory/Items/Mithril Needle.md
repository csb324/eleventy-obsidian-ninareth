It's about a foot long, probably. Very shiny. 

[[Hugh]] first saw this needle in a divination attempt -- it was described as platinum-looking, and as it stabbed into a coal, the coals ignited and then the flames became almost liquid, pooling like blood. 

We assumed this was a metaphor.

Later, after we killed [[Winifey]], we found an empty box on her. The box had an indentation roughly this size and shape.

Minutes later, we saw [[Cinder]] holding something similar... and he used it to create a [[There's Plainly Something Wrong with the Planes|rift of some kind between planes]].
