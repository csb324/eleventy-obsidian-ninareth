# Ebony Stake

A polished splinter of very dark wood, sharp on one end. A vestige of the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]'s coffin. 

Has a very intense aura, with a confusing multiple layers of enchantment. At the root base layer, is deep twisted evil, with a hallowed energy around it. However, something has fundamentally changed this items nature, and it's now Consecrated.
