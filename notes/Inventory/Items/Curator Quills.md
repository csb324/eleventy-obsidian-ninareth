item, a group of test tubes, 3 filled with a small amount of gray liquid, and 3 empty, paired with a thin metal quill. 

### Background
She says the [[The Beauties of Shadow]] may interefer with her magic, but making a mark allows her to temporarily "pierce the veil". She says the Quills are tied to her, and also to the [[The Beauties of Shadow]], and allow her to "step through boundaries". She claims they've been in [[Jalantar]] longer than her. 

Each tube is enough for one use, if we need [[The Curator]]'s help, we should just make a mark with the quill. . The mark can be on whatever [[Freya]] wishes. She says the mark should go wherever she needs assistance the most - but it's implied there could be serious impacts, it's uncertain what those are in advance. 

### How to Use
Using one action, make a mark on what you wish to change using the quill and potion. This gray liquid, derived from or by [[The Curator]], allows them to directly impact an object or creature in a way helpful to the creature making the mark. Properties may vary depending on the intent and the situation of it's application.
