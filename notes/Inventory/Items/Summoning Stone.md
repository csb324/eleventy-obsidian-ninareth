Item

This stone, when active, summoned some very spooky spirits to the [[Temple of Pelor outside Jalantar]]. We don't know who put it there, or why. It was found behind the grave of [[Tenali]]. 

[[Father Gryuu]] asked us to bring it to [[Jalantar]] so that someone at a larger temple could destroy it / untether it / something like that.
