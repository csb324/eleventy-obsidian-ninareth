Item

This stone, when active, summoned some very spooky spirits to the [[Temple of Pelor outside Jalantar]]. We don't know who put it there, or why. It was found behind the grave of [[Tenali]]. 

[[Father Gryuu]] asked us to bring it to [[Jalantar]] so that someone at a larger temple could destroy it / untether it / something like that.

## Updates

[[session-14]] We tried to drop it off at the [[Temple of Pelor in Jalantar]]. They wouldn't take it, (specifically, a dragonborn receptionist named [[Ickthin]] but let us make an appointment.

[[session-23]] Uh-oh, turns out this thing is still active? Brought an angry poltergiest and it's friend to the [[The Golden Gryffon]] and attacked [[Our Party]] during a long rest.
