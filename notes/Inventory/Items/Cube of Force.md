# Cube of Force

A one inch by one inch magic cube, each face has a distinct marking that can be pressed.

Gains charges equal to 1d20 each dawn, max of 36. 

Use an action, use the number of charges based on the face, if you don't have enough charges nothing happens.  If you do, a barrier of invisible force forms a cube 15ft per side, it's centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for one minute unless you use an action to turn it off or it runs out of charges. 

You can press a new face for a new effect by using those charges, resetting to another full minute. If your movement causes the barrier to reach an object that the cube can't move through you must stop. The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted or comes into contact with certain effects. 

### Faces

| Face |    Charges  |  Effect |
|-----|-----|----|
|1    | 1   |   Gases, wind, and fog can't pass through the barrier. |
|2    | 2   |  Nonliving matter can't pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.
|3  |        3           |     Living matter can't pass through the barrier. |
|4   |       4           |     Spell effects can't pass through the barrier. |
|5  |     5 | Nothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.
|6  | 0  | The barrier deactivates. |

The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below.
