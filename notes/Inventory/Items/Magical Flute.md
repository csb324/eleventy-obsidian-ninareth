Item. It's also been called a pipe. #mysteries 

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] wants it, and [[Damien]] has it. [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] was sent to take it from [[Damien]], but we convinced him to give up his home instead. Whatever it does, it seems powerful, and that's the sort of thing [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is interested in.
