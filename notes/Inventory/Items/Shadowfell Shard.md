Item,  tiny black crescent moon-shaped cold crystal filled with the [[The Shadowfell]]'s despair, found where the necromancy ghost died in the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]]


> Can attach it to a tiny object and use it as a focus. When you use Metamagic on a spell while wearing and attuned to the shard, you can curse one creature targeted by the spell. Choose one ability and until the end of your next turn, the creature has disadvantage on checks and saves using that ability. Additionally, when you take a short rest, you can regain sorcery points equal to your proficiency modifier. After you use this ability, roll a d6 when you take a long rest. On a 4-6, it recharges. On a 1-3, you must wait until your next long rest to try and charge it again. Also, please make a tick on this card each time you recharge the shard. 


### Notes

Found at the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]] near [[Niko]]'s [[Groups and Organizations/Fire Raisers]] secret hideout [[The Furnace]]

When [[Hugh]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and [[Rez]] touched it, they felt a bit sad.
