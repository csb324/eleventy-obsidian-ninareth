# Kith and Kin 
A a pulpy fiction novel about two half-elven siblings. Passed among several [[Wayfinders]], and given to [[Freya]] HEAVILY annotated by [[Rawley]] and maybe one other person? 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] tries to puzzle out what these notes mean. 

### Clues

Gods listed in blocked out letters:
* [[Bahamut]]
* [[Sseth]] (maybe seperate?)
* [[Corellon Larethian]]
* [[Pelor]]
* [[Tyr]]
* [[Torm]]
* [[Moradin]]

Dragons is underlined and exclaimed on each of the pages with either help or protect struck-through.

[[Thelran Asari]] is also part of an anagram on pages 220 and 221, maybe "On Thelran Asari's" or the "Son of Thelran Asari"? 
* [[Rez]] remembers that phrase is often coded to [[The Zumbinis]], who are deeply tied to it, no one member in particular
* It also has annotations, "Where could it be??" "Seems like a handy hiding place"
* Underlined is, "Inside the office, the panel with her portrait on it rolled gently out of the way, revealing a compartment that held a leather-bound notebook."
