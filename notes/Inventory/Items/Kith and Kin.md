# Kith and Kin 
A a pulpy fiction novel about two half-elven siblings. Passed among several [[Wayfinders]], and given to [[Freya]] HEAVILY annotated by [[Rawley]] and maybe one other person? 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] tries to puzzle out what these notes mean. 

### What We've Learned

Dragons is underlined and exclaimed on each of the pages with either help or protect struck-through. We confirm [[Bahamut]], [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Pelor]] are assisting/assisted by dragon/s. 

We confirm something is hidden and related to [[The Zumbinis]]
* [[Rez]] remembers that the phrase  "Son of [[Thelran Asari]]i" is often coded to [[The Zumbinis]], who are deeply tied to it, no one member in particular (though [[Stalwart Mudd]] more than others)
* We know something is hidden IN [[Thelran Asari]] that is related to [[The Zumbinis]]. Don't believe a specific item is hinted at, but the word is portrait underlined as weighted and intentional. 

According to [[TrueSilver]] -
* Do dragons need to help or protect [[Bahamut]], [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Pelor]]? YES
* Are the [[Wayfinders]] who wrote the notes in [[Kith and Kin]] trying to help [[Bahamut]], [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Pelor]]? I BELIEVE SO

Some pages flag the words: Everpresent, Eye, Time, and Space. It's also thematically tied to the character Culwin, though we're unsure what that is conveying. 

This looks like a clue and what does it mean from what we can tell? (referring to the [[Ragndaar Mountains]] being added to the map)
* Yes, it feels like it is a clue, but isn't one of the discrete clues mentioned. Very keeping with the circle in the front of the book, which is in the NE section of that Mountain range. Maybe they're connected. It actually, now that we think about it, is priming us to think about these more discrete clues (that are one page) are pointing you towards that. They have signpost clues to get to them. Front and the back put together, it's the same map. 

Are pages 112/113 a red herring?
* yes 

Is any of the iambic pentameter annotations thieves cant?
* when there is iambi pentameter it is all alerting you to the fact that there are clues in the book. None is to convey a specific message you can glean.

We are reading the book, what should we be factoring in to point towards the remaining clues (that we are not currently factoring in)?
* for the distinct remaining clues, the margins are important, look outside the text

Have we identified the last family of clues or is it unknown?
* We have, and it's one of the categories we've identified but not one we've solved
### Other Clues
* There are two more substantial clues, that are discrete and singular, after we figure out the dots above letters thing - and one more family of clues
* We have hit all the large Families of clues 
### Questions
0

### For Consideration
* Map referencing the Mountains/Jorenn
	* Undead are coming from the under dark 
	* The source point for [[Morthos]] or undead stuff in under the [[Ragndaar Mountains]] 
	* [[The Scattered Bar]] run by [[Evlyn]]
* Culwen
	* Leadership of the [[Wayfinders]] is in league with the undead
		* [[Superior Desindever]]? (Page 116)
			* "He held out a hand to Vex. "I don't believe we were properly introduced last night. Culwen. A pleasure to meet you." 
				* "SO like [[Superior Desinfever]] / Not across the board of course"
	* Thereâ€™s a ring like fracture that controls the undead
	* Someone in the [[Wayfinders]] is skimming  / smuggling
	* [[Rawley]] spells Culwen with an 'I' not 'E'?
* [[Brask]] is were some thieves guild is centered? Maybe [[The Silver Hand]]?
* Almost every "Stubby" are circled or underlined
* Many mentions of copper are circled or underlined
* Dreamweavers? "Find out what that reminded you of" - struckthrough 
* Other major family of clues
	* Dog ears - is there something in common on the pages? 
	* [[Wayfinders]] symbols - is there something in common on the pages?
