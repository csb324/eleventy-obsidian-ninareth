Within the [[Zhakastin Expedition]]. A horrific site of 40 corpses pinned to the wall, arms out, legs dangling, skin flayed but pinned back to the walls. In 32, the central cavity reveals their bones have been removed. In the other 8, still no bones, but more noticeably, there's a spike in the center of their chest. 3 in particular with spikes catch our eye as they squirm out of their body, horribly broken and malformed. 

There's powerful arcane energy around these spikes. All 8 are different materials: oak, glass, coal, githyarti wood, sapphire, an unclear silver alloy, bronze, ruby. The githyarti, ruby, and silver alloy are the three currently growing skeletons. They are quickly growing skeletons, the ruby most accurately and quickly, though very malformed still. As it forms, we first see horror, then rage, before breaking. Inside the center of the ruby stake, see a very very thin purple core, tied to dunamancy. 

We discuss that the 5 bodies who have the stakes in them but no bones have stakes that are now inert, they do not have purple cores, and the runes on the side are all different. They seem like failed experiments. 

### When We Removed The Spikes
oak - inert, no immediate effect
glass - inert, no immediate effect
coal - inert, no immediate effect
sapphire - inert, no immediate effect
bronze - inert, no immediate effect

githyarti wood*
	As she pulls the githyarti wood spike, we psychically hear a shrieking in our minds. [[Costi]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] are not effected, the rest of our brains hurt for a minute. As the spike leaves, the bone material rapidly shoots out from the center of it, it grows like dense foliage and vines, bursting quickly before shattering. We clearly ended a process.

unclear silver alloy*
	Another scream sounded, and a similar visual effect happened as calcified white hip bones burst out. 

ruby*
	There's both physical and magical resistance to removal, as the purple core starts to glow more, another shriek sounds. When removed, an intense light flares then fades. As the skeleton that last came from it gasps, rolling up to look at [[Freya]], in draconic says "kill me". We end his suffering. 

Birch - inert, no immediate effect
Iron - inert, no immediate effect
Silver - inert, no immediate effect

Emerald*
	One solid block of bone, a large disc, pulls out as it's removed, cracking into 6 pieces.

Obsidian*
	Blinding flash of purple light, as for a brief moment it forms a circle, singular, but along for a split second.


### What We've Learned About Them
Looking at the stakes, they do have runes carved along them, reminding us of [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] invention of [[dimensional anchor]] (4 in long black metal spike covered in runes: use it to be sure that when youâ€™re interacting with items changes dimensions or time, that things stay in place). However, the rune patterns are not the same. These are primarily conjuration runes, though not typical ones, they have elements of chronurgy interwoven in an unknown-experimental-magic kind of way. 

* Silver Alloy
	* The silver alloy spike is a magical metal (like adamantine or mithril) as a portion capture within it, however seems mostly silver and there's another metal in it like copper, bronze, or gold.
