#  Larethian Rose

<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Origin</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Corellon's Grove]]</span></span>

A rare flower. These blue roses are a sign that [[Corellon Larethian]] is pleased. It is said that they bloom where he walks. 

Someone gave [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] one after she played the harp in [[Corellon's Grove]].

It doesn't wilt, as long as [[Corellon Larethian]] doesn't want it to.
