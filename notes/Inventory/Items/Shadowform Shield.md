# Shadowform Shield

+1 Shield, emblazoned with a black sun and rimmed with twelve sharp points. 

As a bonus action, its wielder can make on attack, adding their attack modifier, dealing 2d6+4 slashing, plus 1d8 necrotic. 

Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw or be knocked prone. Undead are immune to this attack. Last, once daily this shield's wielder can use it to become shadow for 10 minutes. In this form, a creature has a fly speed of 100 ft and con pass through spaces larger than a keyhole.

### Definitely not cursed, right?
When [[Freya]] attunes, it has a dark energy that feels different from the desecrated spot on her back. Nothing to worry about.
