Item, Bow

A +1 magic bow, it's wielder has advantage on attacks against mounted targets. It holds five charges, on a hit, a creature must make a DC 14 strength saving throw or be knocked back 10 ft. Charges recover at end of the day. Deals an additional 1d8 bludgeoning added for each charge. 

Found with a quiver of 10 arrows, the shaft of which glows red and has a thin black gray gel band around the base of the head. Seems like they go boom.

### notes
Used in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]], which makes it even more notorious. Returned to [[Niko]] during our pretend hostage escape.
