This necklace, made of copper dragon scales, seems to resonate with [[Rez]]'s innate magic. 

### To Use
Once per day, you may spend an hour and translate unused sorcery points into this necklace. You must use one spell level per sorcery point you translate. For instance, you could use either one third level spell slot or one first level and one second level spell slot to place three sorcery points into the Scales. 

You can use these points as if they were normal sorcery points. The Scales can hold up to four points. 
### Also
- If you take a long rest while sorcery points remain in the Scales, you must roll a d20.  
- Additionally, the Scales hum with a power that you donâ€™t fully understand. While the Scales have at least three sorcery points in them, you may use an action to expend those sorcery points.
