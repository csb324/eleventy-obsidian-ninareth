#  Mysterious Circles

When [[Freya]] was framed for some kind of crime (unclear) and left [[True North]], she received a note. The note had two symbols on it -- the symbol of the [[Wayfinders]], and these circles. 

[[Freya]] asked [[Niko]] to look into it for her. He gave her a piece of paper that would allow one-way communication, and then incinerate itself, so that he could communicate securely.

[[Session-30]]: [[Niko]] got back to her, and said [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] recognized the symbol. He couldn't say exactly what it was, but it was something that probably existed in his research. So, that's something!
