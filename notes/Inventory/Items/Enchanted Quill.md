Item

A cardinal feather quill with a ruby inlaid inside it. Magically linked to a paired ruby that causes messages written with it to appear where the other ruby is inlaid.

Table in Nikoâ€™s room at [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] house had a desk with a ruby embedded in it.

Messages from this quill may have other destinations as well.
