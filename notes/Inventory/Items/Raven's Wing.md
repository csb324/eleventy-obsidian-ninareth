Requires Attunement
- +1 great sword
- Resistant to necrotic damage
- May use your intelligence modifier for this weapon
- Creatures within 10 ft. of you have advantage on death saving throws
- Twice daily, you can channel the Raven Queen’s energy through Raven’s Wing. All creatures of your choice in a 40 ft. circle, centered on either you or Samuel, must make a DC 16 Con save or be pulled closer to death, taking 4d8 necrotic damage. This bypasses resistance on undead creatures and deals double damage to them.
