Item, Weapon

A simple, unadorned longsword except for a small ruby placed in the base of its hilt. The metal, when you look closely, gives off a slight reddish hue. 

Its wielder can use a **bonus action** to speak its command word and set it ablaze. While on fire, the sword emits **bright light for 40 feet** and dim **light for another 40 feet**. It deals an extra **2d6 fire damage to any target it hits while ablaze**. A bonus action to speak its command word will quiet the flames, as will sheathing the sword.


### Notes
Won by killing [[Limley]] in [[session-30]] after she jumped us
