A fancy silver inlaid ring with a large ruby . If you speak the command word “Ashes”, the ring casts delayed blast fireball, as though you held  concentration for the full duration. 

Does double damage to structures with siege weapon property. One time use of 22d6 fire damage. Must be within 60ft to speak the command word, spell casts in a 20ft sphere,

### notes
