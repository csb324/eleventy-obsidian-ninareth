### Background
[[Rez]] and [[Vask]] head to the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]], where they're able to convince guards to let them have an audience - through some intentional words, and a loaded gun. There, they meet [[Krarrhec]], an elderly copper dragon born, and report on [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]] and get condolences on their sister [[Nehushta]] - [[Zmaj]] had also reached out. [[Rez]] writes down a full summary ([[Rez's Report]]) and they're offered the chance to stay the night for protection in the Sanctuary. They refuse, but are very insistent that the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]] gets involved asap, and get promises that it will be taken care of. 

### Report
YOU ALL NEED TO FIX THIS LIKE RIGHT NOW. IT'S IN PLATINUM SANCTUARIES ACROSS THE CONTINENT. IT'S EMBARRASSING, AND DANGEROUS, AND IT'S OVERDUE, AND WE'RE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY.
