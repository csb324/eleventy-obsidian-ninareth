# spell vibes

**dissonant whispers** - just a spookier viscious mockery. like "*you're going to die today, you're pathetic, you're nothing, you shouldn't have come, this was a mistake, you will leave nothing behind*"

**shatter**: Pluck a harp string SO loud

**tasha's hideous laughter** - 

**viscous mockery** - really go hard

**bane** - musical, play a discordant song so it bounces off their heads the worst
