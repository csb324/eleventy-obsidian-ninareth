# spell vibes

**viscous mockery**: do not hold back at all

**dissonant whispers** - just a spookier viscious mockery. like "*you're going to die today, you're pathetic, you're nothing, you shouldn't have come, this was a mistake, you will leave nothing behind*"

**shatter**: Pluck a harp string SO loud. crescendo that shit until it breaks their brains.

**tasha's hideous laughter**: act like THEY told a joke

**bane** - musical, play a discordant song so it bounces off their heads the worst
