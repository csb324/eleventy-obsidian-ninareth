# the party 
**[[Costi]]**: ohhhh he’s an activist or something. Still foolish, still a wild card, but this is an important puzzle piece. Seemed to respond well to being given fatherly advice, lol. can probably tell him I agree. 

**[[Rez]]**: seems good for the 50 gold. if she isn't, activate STORY TIME.

```ad-spoiler-a
title: story time

tell rez the harp is the last thing i have of my family. that my parents are dead and this belonged to my grandfather and it's suuper important to me to get it repaired because this is our legacy
```


**[[Hugh]]**: get that robot some pants. 

**[[Freya]]**: seems angry and sad all the time, Rez thought that was weird but to me that’s like, yeah she’s PAYING ATTENTION. anyway, whoops.

# other NPCs
**[[Niko]]**: 
He was BONKERS suspicous of me this morning (i.e. rolled a nat 20 on insight and wasn't interested in any of my deflections when he asked extremely normal questions)

he still seems interested though, and lord knows this town isn't big enough to just move on to the next one. 

there’s a way to make this work. 
- [ ] bring him a drink. sit down. chat for a second. say, “look. I have some things in my past I’m not proud of, and I might be a little paranoid. I sort of came out here to start over. So, can we just talk about you?”
		- make it about my sad sad past
		- that's a type of trust, kind of.

**[[Victor]] and the [[Bliken Hammerov]]**: must make sure costi doesn’t try to overthrow the government. 
-   also what does the dwarf want with Hugh
-   also can I have some armor 

**[[Juliette]]**:
- [ ] make sure I talk to her.
1. butter her up a little bit, mention possible connections if she seems interested. also, make sure she's not mad that i bailed the other night
2. find out what she's heard about me

# politics
[[the guardians]]: dicks in charge 

[[the providers]]: big picture they’re RIGHT but being right never got anyone anywhere. so, of course that means they lose elections. plus enough of them are also asshats.
