# Fire Raiser Baddie Audit
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

### The Ask
A few [[Fire Raisers]] including [[Zephyra]], [[Terrav]], and [[Lance]] want is to find who's responsible for  the rising violence within the organziation. The suspect list: [[Niko]], [[Srictha]],  [[Ulia Glorsbade]],  [[Winifey]], and potentiallly [[Twigs]].

For ourselves: how can we prevent the attack in [[Arkhosia (City)]]? Who can we trust to help?

## Current Status Quo
* [[Niko]] seems to have been brought back into the fold, after a short stint in solitary confinement, and some serious questioning. He's now telling us they 'solved' the violence, and only the right "heads will roll"
* [[Winifey]] seemed prepped against [[Costi]] reading her mind. How? 
	* She's also telling us the same story that they've rooted out their violent faction. Must've been [[Ulia Glorsbade]]
* Does [[Niko]] and [[Winifey]] believe this? Or are they giving [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] lies so that they can still use us? 

## Who's Involved

#### Fire raisers involved 
* [[Niko]]
	* Seems to be laying low and potentially avoiding [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]], 
	* Can't receive sendings
	* On the way to [[Arkhosia (City)]]
	* Potentially pulled [[Ulia Glorsbade]]
	* [[Niko]] gets his information from [[Cinder]], but that they don't know Niko is talking to Costi. 
	* Told us we should find him in [[Arkhosia (City)]], at [[Marvin's Corner]] and let the bartender know that we're "there for the apple cider". 
	* [[Niko]] warns us off of [[Terrav]] and [[Winifey]] too. 
* [[Zephyra]]
	* Asked for our help with [[Terrav]]
	* Tasked with finding outliers
	* Wants to find [[Niko]] in hopes he's the lynchpin 
	* Hopes [[Niko]] is innocent
* [[Terrav]]
	* Asked for our help with [[Zephyra]]
	* Not high up, but wants violence to stop
	* Hopes [[Niko]] is innocent
	* Looking into political recruits from [[Jalantar]], and looking into action by [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] concerning the [[Arkhosian Elections]]. 
* [[Winifey]]
	* Originally in the suspect group, due to her ties to [[Niko]]
	* Right-hand to [[Cinder]], investigated by him, and ultimately 'cleared'. 
	* Thinks the fact [[Niko]] is MIA has put suspicion on him for not being able to answer questions.
		* He worked the [[Bellisme Show]]
		* Thinks [[Niko]] has crossed a bridge and potentially brought others along with him. Believes if he wasn't the one who planned the attack, that he was at least instrumental in it. 
		* Does she know that [[Cinder]] is feeding info to [[Niko]]??
	* The [[Fire Raisers]] want to delay their "programming" until they know their house is in order, to be sure things are good. 
	* Gave us the [[Fire Raiser Mystery Cylinder]], a map location, a cover story, and some red herring clues to tell [[Ricci Scrucks]] on the [[Bellisme Show]] investigation.
	* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Freya]] seems to get vibes she's not being entirely truthful.
	* [[Ulia Glorsbade]] is also gone, she thinks [[Niko]] helped her get out of the city. 
		* Thinks they're heading to [[Arkhosia (City)]]. 
		* Told [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] to find her, why? Maybe for us to learn about the bombs? 
	* [[Costi]] detects her thoughts, sees a red undullating wave when we mention what plans might be coming up in [[Arkhosia (City)]].
		* Tells us to stay away from the docks, thinks it's [[Sill Dockhouse]] (might be Kayson's) on the 15th.
		* [[Ulia Glorsbade]] clarified the [[Cloud's Lament]]
	* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks about other radicals within the [[Fire Raisers]] who could be a problem: in her thoughts [[Costi]] sees [[Niko]], a tiefling, and a flash of [[Cinder]]. 
* [[Srictha]]
	* Officially MIA for the [[Fire Raisers]]
	* Hid at [[The Sheath and Sickle]] thanks to [[Giary]]
	* We believe uninvolved in the [[Bellisme Show]] attack. Seems worried about the violent tendencies
	* Said the energy at [[The Furnace]] night of the attack was very sus, and intuition told him to leave
	* Felt things have been "off" for the last few weeks in the [[Fire Raisers]]. There'd been a bunch of new recruits, but while most folks were excited, [[Cinder]] was acting frustrated. Didn't seem to like the orders he was being given. Understood the new folks were important people in the city, folks of signficance. 
	* Hasn't seen [[Niko]] since the attack, but he wouldn't be surprised if he was caught up in all of this - he's got a lot of anger. 
	* Thinks he saw a [[Dragon's Hide]] helm in [[Cinder]]'s office with [[Winifey]]. 
	* Asked us if there was a way to help him get to [[Arkhosia (City)]], that he still believes in the [[Fire Raisers]] mission - and wants to be sure it happens in the right way. 
		* We sent him there with [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Klida]]
	* [[Niko]] says we should not trust him and that he might be trying to stop the movement.
* [[Cinder]]
	* Leads [[The Furnace]] but clearly not the decision-maker for the [[Fire Raisers]] overall
	* Seemed unhappy about some new recruits, according to [[Srictha]]
	* Potentially one of the more violent-prone believers, according to a detect thoughts on [[Winifey]]
	* Leading the hunt for [[Niko]], [[Srictha]],  [[Ulia Glorsbade]],  [[Winifey]], and potentiallly [[Twigs]].
	* Wrote the [[From the Ashes Flyer]]

#### Friends of Niko
* [[Giary]]
	* Has been liasing with the [[Fire Raisers]]
	* Actually doesn't know where [[Niko]] is
	* Hid [[Srictha]] in [[The Sheath and Sickle]], might know where other [[Fire Raisers]] hideaways are? 
* [[Deeksta]]
	* Saw [[Niko]] briefly in [[Tinzelven]], after the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]], but before the [[Bellisme Show]]  
	* Says [[Niko]] seemed excited about things, but that they never really talked about politics, given her position with [[Willen Guruden]]. It turns out, she's a voter! 
	* Believes [[Niko]] was hiding in [[Jalantar|plain sight]]. 
	* Asked [[Rez]] to help keep [[Niko]] on the right side of things. 
* [[Winston]]
	* Old buddy of [[Niko]]'s, was brought back to [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] when [[Niko]] knew he'd be leaving

#### Who else is looking for Niko?
* [[Ricci Scrucks]]
	* Probably not involved, though we've heard that a few members of the [[Dragon's Hide]] are working with the [[Fire Raisers]], so he might be one / know them?
	* Leading the investigation into the [[Bellisme Show]] attack with [[Ellinev Del]]


## Thoughts and Updates
* Do we use the fake [[Fire Raisers]] clues from [[Winifey]] or try to find soemthing real to tell [[Ricci Scrucks]]?

## Steps to Take
* Check-out the [[Fire Raiser Mystery Cylinder]] and be sure it's not STILL a bomb
* Go investigate the fake [[Fire Raisers]] hideout location on a map, gather the red herrings there for "evidence" in the [[Bellisme Show]] investigation. Planned by [[Winifey]]
* Give [[Ricci Scrucks]] the [[Fire Raiser Mystery Cylinder]] and other evidence as our update to the [[Bellisme Show]] attack investigation. Tell [[Winifey]]'s cover story of a "shadowy figure" leaving the sewers
* Look for clues in the old [[Fire Raisers]] hideout on the road to [[Arkhosia (City)]], the [[Ruins of Fort Chyvensti]]. Tasked by [[Winifey]]
* Contact [[Srictha]] when we get to [[Arkhosia (City)]] and meet up
* Investigate the [[Fire Raisers]] plan the the Docks in [[Arkhosia (City)]] to figure out if we want to intervene
	* Whole bunch of [[The Guardians]] uniforms are involved?
