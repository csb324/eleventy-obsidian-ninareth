## Current Rules:
- Cannot lie about being busted
- Must spend this time with other humanoids who have the ability to bust you
- Someone has to actually tell you they know you’re a dragon. It doesn’t count if it’s a suspicion or if they know but never say it out loud.
- Must be said in hearing range of one of the game bracelets, can be any of them though
	- Message also triggers it
- If busted you must stay in humanoid form until either:
	- Confirmation you won
	- The end of the century, beginning after confirmation of sibling’s win
- Must always wear [the game bracelet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084BVMMZJ/?coliid=I1VJYAIIMH83PJ&colid=2VX4X3ARX2837&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) (magic item that informs the other if busted)
