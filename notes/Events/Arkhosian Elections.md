#  Arkhosian Elections
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Upcoming</span></span>

## Background
Large election in [[Arkhosia]] held in [[Arkhosia (City)]]. Everybody who's anybody will be there -- including [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]]

Main parties: [[The Guardians]] and [[The Providers]]

### Trouble Incoming
Seems like the [[Fire Raisers]] are planning some political drama. We're not sure what, but our clues so far:
* [[Srictha]] had been tasked with bringing 40 green and black uniforms - sounds like [[The Guardians]] maybe? 
* [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Klida]] is bringing [[Srictha]] down
* [[Giary]] plans to meet us there
* [[Victor]] is there in his official capacity
* [[Winifey]] plans to head down and warned us to **stay away from the docks on the 15th** - namely [[Sill Dockhouse]] (might be [[Kayson's]]) 
* [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] has some work for [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]], will be in town

### Events
* [[The Providers]] party that [[Ellinev Del]] invited [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] to
* [[Fire Raisers]] are planning *something* at the Docks on the 15th
