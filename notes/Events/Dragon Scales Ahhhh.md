# Dragon Scales Ahhhhh
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

### The Problem
[[Father Thronestone]] helped out [[Rez]] with an experimental treatment - melting down dragon scales and grafting them onto her cut patch of dragon scales on her face. To everyone's delight, it worked! However, this got [[Father Thronestone]] thinking -- could this be a new breakthrough?? Spoiler: it should not be. 

### What's Happened? 
[[Father Thronestone]] talked shop with [[Burru Ilp]], and grafted some blue and red scales onto his forearm - bad call since it turns out he's a cultist who loves [[Tiamat]] and [[Galaphanel]], in fact, he think's he's got [[Galaphanel]]'s blood. [[Burru Ilp]] starts acting strange and has a couple of friends who also say the same thing. Thronestone gave him scales, Burru supplied some more, and now they're forcing the procedure onto others. 

We agreed to go take care of it, and keep it a secret. [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] goes to his house, which we decide to call [[The Tiamat House]]. It's covered in pro-[[Tiamat]] and pro-[[Galaphanel]] art, as well as other dragon decor.

* [[Pleetos Alentas]] is still at large, with brass scales grafted onto him
	* [[Eirian]], the [[Dragonsfire Forge]], and [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]] are looking for him, unbeknowst to each other
* The [[Weird Boulder]] is with [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and [[Vask]] on her airship
	* [[Costi]] kissed it, but it didn't seem like the rock from [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]]'s cryptic request
* What is the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]]'s knowledge or involvement with [[Burru Ilp]]? 
* [[Victoria Several]] now has a house in  [[The Fallsides]], and gets a vote
