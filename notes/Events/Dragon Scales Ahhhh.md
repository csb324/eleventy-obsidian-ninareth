### The Problem
[[Father Thronestone]] helped out [[Rez]] with an experimental treatment - melting down dragon scales and grafting them onto her cut patch of dragon scales on her face. To everyone's delight, it worked! However, this got [[Father Thronestone]] thinking -- could this be a new breakthrough?? Spoiler: it should not be. 

### What's Happened? 
[[Father Thronestone]] talked shop with [[Burru Ilp]], and grafted some blue and red scales onto his forearm - bad call since it turns out he's a cultist who loves [[Tiamat]] and [[Galaphanel]], in fact, he thinks he's got [[Galaphanel]]'s blood. [[Burru Ilp]] starts acting strange and has a couple of friends who also say the same thing. Thronestone gave him scales, Burru supplied some more, and now they're forcing the procedure onto others. 

We agreed to go take care of it, and keep it a secret. [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] goes to his house, which we decide to call [[The Tiamat House]]. It's covered in pro-[[Tiamat]] and pro-[[Galaphanel]] art, as well as other dragon decor. We kill them all, and steal there plans. Now to make sure this isn't spreading...

### How Has this Spread?
[[Ghez Yhutl]] got looped in by [[Rez]] and has been investigating the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Jalantar]], learning of [[Jorus]] exchanging letters with [[Yhridex]] from [[Platinum Sanctuary of Durmask]]. [[Pleetos Alentas]] fled to [[Thelran Asari]], where [[Ghez Yhutl]] is now headed believing he's uncovered a front. [[Rez]]'s sister [[Eirian]] is there on the hunt too. 

[[Ghez Yhutl]] found a turncoat named [[Nikander Vhegohl]] who was working with others in [[Jalantar]] to graft a strange [[Mithril Alloy]] onto a young blue dragon. They got their material sourced from a blacksmith named [[Clive]]. [[Divitston Goldstone]] and [[Ghez Yhutl]] killed [[Clive]], but it seems [[Nikander Vhegohl]] is still at large. 

[[Zmaj]] tells us that one of the grafted might have been operating in [[Ru'Nileth]]. The only found blood, and a few mutilated corpses, but no scales - just diagrams. He's also heard rumors, it seems like it's spread and is talk of "putting down" new draconic creations, they call themselves [[Boulder Makers]]. 

[[Eirian]] and [[Ghez Yhutl]] report [[Pleetos Alentas]] escaped [[Thelran Asari]] and made it to [[Durmask]]. Suspicious, as [[Rez's Family]] gets word [[Nehushta]] is killed there. So [[Zmaj]], [[Zoheret|Zoha]], [[Zalvaris|Zalv]], [[Simin]], and [[Taji]] are all on the hunt in [[Durmask]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] scrying revealed [[Pleetos Alentas]] to be on a lake nearby, maybe [[Lake Delente]]?
