# Zalevi embassy prison break

<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ended</span></span>

[[Niko]], [[Qik]], [[Zephra]], and others are being held at the zalevi embassy for extradition. We're going to break them out. 

## The team 
- [[Our Party]]
- [[Giary]]
- [[Innis]]
- [[Vrolbekk Pixies]] (Bel)
- [[Kara]]

## Puzzle pieces
- Exploding arrows that seem particularly good at damaging walls, from [[Niko]]'s room
- Pixie dust from the [[Vrolbekk Pixies]]
- Knowledge of the inside of the embassy from [[Kara]]
- [[Captain Fretze]] likes us 
- [[Doha]] owes [[Rez]] a drawing 
- A haunted [[Summoning Stone]] 

## The plan
Loosely, we are thinking we will in fact send in [[Rez]] who wants to see her buddy [[Captain Fretze]] and [[Doha]] for her drawing. Then we can use [[Niko]]'s fancy exploding arrows to blow holes in the walls. hooo boy.  I sure hope [[Kara]] has given this some extra thought over the last few days. 

## Preparations 
- [x]  Talk to Kara and find out where the prisoners are held, what kind of defenses they have in there, et cetera  (she didn't know)
- [x]  go shopping??
- [x]  Ask bel about pixie dust possibly, to facilitate escape
