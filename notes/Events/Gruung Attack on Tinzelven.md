The [[Gruung]] attacked [[Tinzelven]], believing that humans (etc) were taking over their forest -- possibly true -- and that the [[Gruung]] should be the master race -- definitely false. 

## Outcome
Luckily, we had advance notice and were prepared! [[Our Party]] waited for the rest of the [[Tinzelven Town Guard]] and miscellaneous capable people to drive the Gruung into the [[Laborers Hall]], where we were waiting. We got wrecked, but we all survived and we killed all the [[Gruung]].

## Preparations
- [x] inform the [[Tinzelven Town Guard]]
- [ ] Get mad robots to help, via [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]?  (no: too unreliable, according to [[Deeksta]])
