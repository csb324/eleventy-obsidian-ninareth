# Our mail is going missing
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

Just feels worth noting. We asked [[Loomis]] about it in [[Session-30]]. 

It's also possible people are just lying to us about trying to send us mail. 

### Examples
[[Vigo Underswell]] said he attempted to contact us to discuss the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]

[[Rhy Zahn]] said he reached out regarding an interview for [[The Talon]]
