# Getting Freaky in Viliki

### What's Freaky? 
Recently, in a town just north of here, [[Viliki]], has had reports of illegal necromantic practice there. Reports are scattered.

* The town also supports a fishing guild with higher than usual mortality, we could talk to them. 370% more 
* Robbings at the [[Viliki Boneyard]] - 19 full exhumations have happened that are not officially accounted for  - the last was 9 days ago. For more than half of those that went missing, they were stolen at the same time as official military exhumations. 
* Random townspeople have gone missing, some proven dead some presumed such, it's 11% higher than it should be over the last 6 months.
* An attacked caravan with [[Eberronian Military]] supplies taken, it was due to a nearby establishment run by the [[Eberronian Third Division]] of blood, bone, and other materials needed for necromancy and it's missing. Some of those items are believed to have been found in [[Viliki]]
* Two black cloaked suspicious figures were tailing a drunkard home, after [[Shay]] marked him leaving, but got spooked and left

### About [[Viliki]]
A newer settlement, about 46 years old, of about 10,000 people. It's about a weeks travel outside [[Jezeten]]. Northern [[Nushkev]] is a few days away from the [[Burbank Compound]] by walking. It's under [[Baron Pendaras Nushkev]]'s protection, who known as an absentee baron and rules very lightly. The [[Burbanks]] have filled the void, and are essentially in charge. The [[Eberronian Second Division]] tends to be the dominate force wherever it goes.

There's a small wall around the town, with a break in the walls overlooking the bay, and a giant fountain in the center of [[Fendridad Square]]. A path cut into the stone goes up the mountain, with a large mansion 500 feet up, for [[Baron Pendaras Nushkev]]. We and the [[Mayor Galfeedz Drakurshire]] have offices in the [[Ratoucha]], which he says is essentially a town hall in [[Eberron]].

### Who's Who
* [[Mayor Galfeedz Drakurshire]].  He's a former admiral in the [[Eberronian Military]], and developed a taste for foreign goods. He gives [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] each a writ of authority to give us legal protection while we investigate, but it requires us to give our blood. He says it will identify us and confirm who it was given to and by.
	* He'll provide some background, including the registered necromancers.
	* He reports directly to the [[Burbanks]]. 
	* He issued the main reports that are leading us on this necromantic goose chase
* [[Security Director Aldi]] leads the [[Viliki]] guard, and has an outpost in the western side of town that is more prone to crime. He says it's mostly a residential area except the [[Founding Flagon]], an inn. 
* [[Pooka]] the Grave-tender of the [[Viliki Boneyard]], 
	* we spoke about things have been going missing, and they'll know more. 
	* The robbings have been correlated with official military exhumations, and nothing has been found other than things that could be in the graves.
* [[Captain Kalorek Plunderov]] is also a good point, but he's delegated the investigation to his subordinates, we can get more information from them. 
* [[Garida]] a kobold who is the sole survivor of the caravan attack, she's staying at the [[Founding Flagon]]. She's from [[Mulfara]]. She shows us the site.
	* [[Marina Alduchev]] introduced us. 
	* She doesn't know much, but is an in
	* Is going to ask about the bodies of her travel companions 
	* Could we speak with dead with them?
* [[Baron Pendaras Nushkev]] lives in [[Viliki]], but appoints power out to the mayor. 
* [[Captain Kalorek Plunderov]] is in the [[Eberronian Second Division]] and oversees the military garrison there
* [[Shay]] who suspiciously watched our friend leave before he was attacked - seems like it's a false identity. We tried to look into her house, there's a trapped area and she seems to have alarmed against intruders. She's hired guards and cleaned up any signs of paperwork or red liquid are all put away and hidden. Her house is also wildly booby-trapped in like a day.
* [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim]] is leading the investigation, has a very tough stance on crime, and believes a group called [[Shari's Boys]] to be responsible. We're starting to wonder if her discontent with the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] might lead her to be involved. 

### Registered Necromancers
All four have left [[Viliki]] within the last two weeks. Coincidence? See if there's people who know them? 
	[[Sinan]]
	[[Zesnel Ponner]] (end of their name was listed on the caravan manifest)
	[[Mim]] 
	[[Seshum Cinen]]

### Hints the [[Eberronian Military]] is involved
* Grave robbings have been correlated with official military exhumations, and nothing has been found other than things that could be in the graves.
* The military guards went to investigate the cart attack, were semi-suspiciously close by, and there were signs of undead covered up there
* [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] expressed a lot of strong difference of opinion from the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]]
* The military was watching [[Security Director Aldi]], and he's been absent
