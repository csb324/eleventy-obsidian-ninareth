## Background

[[Norathar Pent]] is a fine lumber supplier who represents [[The Promenade]]. She's a [[The Providers|Provider]], but she also has a way of clearing land in units just-too-small to grant anyone voting status, unless they're people she *wants* to have voting status. She talks a lot about expanding prosperity, but she's actually as corrupt as the rest of them. Turns out she's mentioned a lot in The Talon for her "charitable work". 

To clear this land, she works with [[Vigo Underswell]], who contracts it out to [[The Stagehands]].

[[Vigo Underswell]] is a member of [[The Guardians]] and an Overseer of [[The Publics]] -- a job that doesn't require much from him, which is good, because he doesn't seem to be good at much. 

The Underswell family has been in politics for generations, and Vigo is quite preoccupied with appearances. He's also importing illegal drugs, which involves working with [[The Stagehands]]. (Why is he dealing drugs? He's bankrupt.)

Anyway [[The Stagehands]] gave the [[Fire Raisers]] this intel, and the [[Fire Raisers]] have asked us to do something about it. 

A very simple plan: they've forged two letters, between the two of them, which put the nature of their collaboration (and crimes!) in writing. Our task is to sneak those letters into their respective offices.

To complicate matters, we *also* need to *steal* from each of them -- [[Norathar Pent|Pent]] has a ring that she likes to wear, and [[Vigo Underswell|Underswell]] has an interesting vial of liquid somewhere in his office. 
The [[Fire Raisers]] want those things.

## Plan
We have two days

Got [[Divitston Goldstone]] to make us a replica [[Norathar Pent]] ring and told him it was for [[Rez]]

We contracted [[The Stagehands]] help, they gave us upcoming schedules for both [[Norathar Pent]] and [[Vigo Underswell]], and help us see both of them. 

#### Pent Plan

Hugh is going to detect magic to see what vibe Pent's ring has, then enchant the fake the pick up to match, then give it to Costi. [[Costi]] will use the spell Wrist Pocket to try and steal the ring from [[Norathar Pent]] at a [[Promenade Aid Society]] fundraiser, "Pies and Puppies" [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] will knock into her, spilling a drink, presumably having her lose the ring, then "find" it and replace it with a magically-enhanced fake

[[Rez]] and [[Freya]] going on lunch break during the Promen-Aid event to plant the letter. Rez has [[Circlet of Sending]] theives tools and the letter. Adrienne says to hide it near a secret compartment but not in it. Look for uneven designs. Rez is going to suggest to a guard that Ferro told her and Freya to run this important paperwork about North to Pent's office, and someone is supposed to take us there. Adrienne forged some fake papers about logging to plant

Both worked! Not quite as described but it's done. See [[session-26]] for details

We know now that [[Norathar Pent]]'s ring is a [[Ring of Efreet Summoning]]. Wonder why the [[Fire Raisers]] want that... 

#### Underswell Plan

Our party is going to talk to [[Ellinev Del]] and see if she'll give us an introduction letter to [[Vigo Underswell]]. We'll then go to his office building, use the introduction to enter the building, and make our way to his office to break in, steal the potion, and plant the letter. 

[[Giary]] successfully used the [[The Stagehands]] to move a meeting they have with [[Vigo Underswell]] to "Raven Day at 3, where he's going is not known to us but he won't be in his office"

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] [[Freya]] and [[Costi]] snuck in to his office, and played politics with him, discussing the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]. [[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] waited in the room invisibly and hid the letter in a stack of papers, and were able to steal his potion

## Consequences
If we pull it off, the [[Fire Raisers]] will introduce us to someone who thinks he knew [[Costi's Dad]] in the [[Bihor Region]] (near [[New Fairhaven]]). Plus, they say they'll give us more information.

If we *warn* the targets, we will royally piss off the [[Fire Raisers]]. 

[[Limley]] got fired from [[Pent Logging]], and blamed us (fair). Jumped [[Our Party]] but got herself killed.
