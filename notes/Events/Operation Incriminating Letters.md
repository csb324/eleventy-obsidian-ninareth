#  Operation Incriminating Letters

## Background

[[Norathar Pent]] is a fine lumber supplier who represents [[The Promenade]]. She's a [[The Providers|Provider]], but she also has a way of clearing land in units just-too-small to grant anyone voting status, unless they're people she *wants* to have voting status. She talks a lot about expanding prosperity, but she's actually as corrupt as the rest of them. Turns out she's mentioned a lot in The Talon for her "charitable work". 

To clear this land, she works with [[Vigo Underswell]], who contracts it out to [[The Stagehands]].

[[Vigo Underswell]] is a member of [[The Guardians]] and an Overseer of [[The Publics]] -- a job that doesn't require much from him, which is good, because he doesn't seem to be good at much. 

The Underswell family has been in politics for generations, and Vigo is quite preoccupied with appearances. He's also importing illegal drugs, which involves working with [[The Stagehands]]. (Why is he dealing drugs? He's bankrupt.)

Anyway [[The Stagehands]] gave the [[Fire Raisers]] this intel, and the [[Fire Raisers]] have asked us to do something about it. 

A very simple plan: they've forged two letters, between the two of them, which put the nature of their collaboration (and crimes!) in writing. Our task is to sneak those letters into their respective offices.

To complicate matters, we *also* need to *steal* from each of them -- [[Norathar Pent|Pent]] has a ring that she likes to wear, and [[Vigo Underswell|Underswell]] has an interesting vial of liquid somewhere in his office. 
The [[Fire Raisers]] want those things.


## Consequences

If we pull it off, the [[Fire Raisers]] will introduce us to someone who thinks he knew [[Costi's Dad]] in the [[Bihor Region]] (near [[New Fairhaven]]). Plus, they say they'll give us more information.

If we *warn* the targets, we will royally piss off the [[Fire Raisers]]. 

## Plan
We have three days

Got [[Divitston Goldstone]] to make us a replica [[Norathar Pent]] ring and told him it was for [[Rez]]

We contracted [[The Stagehands]] help, they gave us upcoming schedules for both [[Norathar Pent]] and [[Vigo Underswell]], and help us see both of them. 

[[Costi]] will use the spell Wrist Pocket to try and steal the ring from [[Norathar Pent]] at a [[Promenade Aid Society]] fundraiser, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] will knock into her, presumably having her loose the ring, then "find" it and replace it with a magically-enhanced fake by [[Hugh]]
