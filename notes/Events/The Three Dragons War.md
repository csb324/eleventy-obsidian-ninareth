# The Three Dragons War and the Second Sundering

<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Ninarith]]</span></span>

[[Tiamat]] tried to rise again, but a group called [[The Zumbinis]] stopped her. I mean, a lot of people stopped her, but they were the final sunderers.

## Outcome

[[Tiamat]]'s three heads were sundered and she was returned to hell-prison. [[Guâ€™athrithen]] seems to maybe have been resettled by the remains of her armies.
