# Rez Hires an Actor
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

## Background
[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Freya]] were out looking for the members of [[Left Side Haircut]] at [[Redscale]]. They didn't find who they were looking for, but they did find a flyer from [[Rez]], offering to hire an actor. She said to meet her at the [[Seven Hooves]].

This was before we met [[Vask]], so [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Freya]] theorized that maybe [[Rez]] didn't have a brother, and she was going to hire one.

Rez kept sketchily running off to the [[Seven Hooves]]. [[Hugh]] joined her.

Eventually we met [[Vask]], and he's definitely a Tanin. 

## Who's Involved

[[session-41|But later]], we finally saw this plan come to fruition: She hired someone to announce that [[Vask]] has chlamydia. He did an excellent (?) job.
