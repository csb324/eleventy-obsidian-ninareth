# Resurrect Adrienne
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

### The Ritual
Requires a very very powerful spell, and it doesn't always work. It basically gives you one shot, and your chances are done. Only the most powerful people on the material plane can cast it.

It's also about the most expensive thing that you can do, requires 25,000 GP. Even with that much money, trying to get that many diamonds is a challenge. 

### Helpers
* [[Victoria Several]]
	* She doesn't know anyone personally but she can guess a few:
		* [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]]
		* Temple of [[Yondala]] in [[Thelran Asari]]
		* [[Church of Tyr]], [[Church or Torm]], and [[Church of Pelor]] in [[Durmask]]
		* [[Church of Corellon Larethian]], in [[Ru'Nileth]]. 
	* Will help us acquire diamonds with [[The Silver Halves]], and we can work out a way to compensate them back. It sounds like they might need some help in the near future. 
		* Potentially we could work with [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] to pull some from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. 
* [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]
	* Has ties to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] and has given us a pretty nice diamond as a result
	* [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] has asked if we could have more, and he said we could buy them from him.
* [[Corellon's Grove]] 
	* [[Dawenys]]
* [[Willow]]
	* He is also invested in this, since ever since [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s death, his apocalyptic visions have been  worse.
	* He believes the answer is in [[Quaath]].
	* He says every time he looks at a calendar it flashes to the month Hulfni (which is three months way) and the Miirkikear (Day of the Songs) in that month. 
	* So if we go to [[Quaath]] on a Miirkikear in Hulfni and play a song on the harp, he thinks he'll have an epileptic fit, and that's... a *good* thing, I guess.
* [[Rez's Family]]
	* [[Rez]] is going to ask. Can't hurt, right? 

### Next Steps
* Find 25,000GP worth of diamonds (have 8,484gp worth - need 16,516gp worth)
	* We have:
		* Near flawless diamond - worth 5000gp (Carried by [[Hugh]])
		* Small diamonds - 300gp worth
		* 1,284 gold into diamonds from [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]
		* diamond ring - 3's revivify's worth (900gp worth)
		* diamond tennis bracelet from [[Sheske Eeping]] - 14 near flawless stones ~1,000gp
* Find someone to legends lore [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp we're returning to the [[Temple of Corellon Outside Quaath]]
* Buy diamonds in [[Quaath]]
