# Resurrect Adrienne
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

### The Ritual
Requires a very very powerful spell, and it doesn't always work. It basically gives you one shot, and your chances are done. Only the most powerful people on the material plane can cast it.

It's also about the most expensive thing that you can do, requires 25,000 GP. Even with that much money, trying to get that many diamonds is a challenge. 

### Helpers
* [[Victoria Several]]
	* She doesn't know anyone personally but she can guess a few:
		* [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]]
		* Temple of [[Yondala]] in [[Thelran Asari]]
		* [[Church of Tyr]], [[Church or Torm]], and [[Church of Pelor]] in [[Durmask]]
		* [[Church of Corellon Larethian]], in [[Ru'Nileth]]. 
	* Will help us acquire diamonds with [[The Silver Halves]], and we can work out a way to compensate them back. It sounds like they might need some help in the near future. 
		* Potentially we could work with [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] to pull some from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. 
* [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]
	* Has ties to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] and has given us a pretty nice diamond as a result
	* [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] has asked if we could have more, and he said we could buy them from him.
	* We bought out his store, but they weren't as plentiful as we hoped.
* [[Corellon's Grove]] 
	* [[Dawenys]]
* [[Willow]]
	* He is also invested in this, since ever since [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s death, his apocalyptic visions have been  worse.
	* He believes the answer is in [[Quaath]].
	* He says every time he looks at a calendar it flashes to the month Hulfni and the Miirkikear (Day of the Songs) in that month. 
	* So if we go to [[Quaath]] on a Miirkikear in Hulfni and play a song on the harp, he thinks he'll have an epileptic fit, and that's... a *good* thing, I guess.
* [[Rez's Family]]
	* [[Rez]] is going to ask. Can't hurt, right? 
	* [[Vask]] is also going to check-in.
* [[Temple of Corellon Outside Quaath]]
	* [[Fig]] is the matron, who is willing to let us try - even though [[Willow]] is a kook - because she cared for [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]].

### Next Steps
* Find 25,000GP worth of diamonds (have 8,484gp worth - need 16,516gp worth)
	* We have:
		* Near flawless diamond - worth 5000gp (Carried by [[Hugh]])
		* Small diamonds - 300gp worth
		* 1,284 gold into diamonds from [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]
		* diamond ring - 3's revivify's worth (900gp worth)
		* diamond tennis bracelet from [[Sheske Eeping]] - 14 near flawless stones ~1,000gp
* Find someone to legends lore [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp we're returning to the [[Temple of Corellon Outside Quaath]]
* Buy diamonds in [[Quaath]]

### Actions
Before bed, [[Hugh]] tries to Divine from [[TrueSilver]], asking "What is the most helpful way we can be prepared for [[Resurrect Adrienne]] tomorrow?" In the fire, four lines of flame rise up, one drifts down and fades out entirely, the other three drift and burn. From further away, another column of flame, burning silver in a thin straight line, bends and touches the floor of the hearth - around it three other piles of ash around it. (ash, flame touch, ash, ash). 

The next morning, [[Fig]] brings us the harp and offers the power of prayer in our aid. She leads us down into a chamber at the very base of the temple. There's vines and thick roots running up the walls. [[Willow]] waits in the room and plucks at a lute. We give him the harp, and after a weighted pause he begins plucking strings. At first it was random, but eventually falls into the recognizable tune [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] warmed up with every morning. It transitions into the first song we heard her play. As he progresses, he starts to worsen, gagging, then shaking. Eventually flying into a strangled seizure, body tense while his hands still play, before a vine bursts out of his mouth. It moves through the room like a snake, until it touches the far wall and connects - growing upwards. Tendrils of vine pull out of it, until a 10 square foot area is created, building over itself until a thick patch is generated. Suddenly, everything freezes, as a blade cuts through the vine, showing a tall bronze skinned short dark curly hair and shirtless humanoid, coming from a white pool of light. He recognizes [[Willow]], begins to speak, as four spear points pierce his chest, then a sword crashed through his skull, and he's yanked back towards a now purple portal and 5 shadowy creatures stand mid-attack.
