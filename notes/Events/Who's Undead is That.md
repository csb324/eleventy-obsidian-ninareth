Ok I’m not saying it was Rez’s mom’s FAULT but she was definitely INVOLVED. - Clara 

### What We've Been Told
About 6 months ago [[Gu’athrithen]] complained that undead have been spotted along the southern border of [[Turian Waste]]. They allege [[Eberron]] has been sending them intentionally to do damage and harm, but [[Eberron]] claims they did not send them. 

[[Gu’athrithen]] has proven that there have been some powerful undead. While they're not sanctioned from the [[Eberronian Military]] they might be unlicensed practitioners from [[Eberron]]. While typically they would send the [[Bone Breakers]], they're otherwise obligated, so they're asking [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] instead. 

The reports say undead have been spotted primarily in the [[Turian Waste]], beginning closer to the [[Eberron]] border, but is spreading. The draconics of [[Gu’athrithen]] need resolution, and assurance it's not coming from [[Eberron]] - they're worried about war breaking out. [[Deregheir]] has been acting as a facilitator of the conversations. They've been unsuccessful negotiating now, but [[Eberron]] hopes they'll be an ally. Relations have been strained historically - it's unclear if they'll be helpful should war breaks out.

### Our Job
Our starting point would be going to where the last undead were found. If we can track down the necromantic activity source, and stop it - ideally finding proof that it is not intentionally coming from [[Eberron]]. "We can kill whoever we need to kill", and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks for that in writing lol. 

[[Jehneim Bastienev]], [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], and [[Colvia Ghul]] plan to make [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] a dossier once the information is reviewed and approved. [[Trisha]] and [[Colvia Ghul]] will see to our supplies, as [[Colvia Ghul]] has spent a good deal of time in the [[Turian Waste]]. They'll get us to the border and supply us with horses too. 

We're heading to the [[Gu’athrithen]] mine, [[Zhakastin Expedition]] about 35 miles north of the border, where the unexplained mass casualty event took place. 

### What We Find Out
A group of undead, believed to be fifty or sixty at least, were lead by a very chatty (constant chattering, maybe seemed nuts) skeleton creatures with a shiny staff - did big magic. Killed everyone inside the [[Zhakastin Expedition]]. 

### What's it mean to us?
* Seems like it ties into [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]] and the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]] 
	* [[Hugh|Finn]] communes with [[TrueSilver]]: "Is the undead activity in the [[Turian Waste]]s tied to what's threatening the gods?" "Yes"
* Part of our plan [[A Murder of Dukes]]
* Strengthens our cover story from the [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]] 

### Helpers
* [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] 
	* Has spent the last month in [[Deregheir]] but doesn't seem to be genuinely trying to get them involved, which [[Rez]] encourages. 
	* She gives [[Costi]] a scroll of teleport circle and shows him their circle so we can get back quickly if needed. 
	* She intentionally allowed the diplomacy to fail between [[Eberron]] and [[Gu’athrithen]], and intentionally brought a very expensive airship here. War fermenting there is an excellent excuse to position more [[Eberronian Second Division]] troops into [[Jezeten]] - but it shouldn't progress into full war. However, we should do what we can to actually solve the tension. 
	* Cover story for the [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]]:
		* [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] has been trying a diplomatic approach but believes the attack on the ship was an escalation and response to her work. 
		* A second, related attack, seems to have happened near where our ship crashed. Some [[Arkhosia]] [[Listeners Party]] members were found there, which would be a worrying sign of increases in tension, though maybe some are acting on their own, or even members of the [[Fire Raisers]].
* He took a boat here from [[The Tendrils]] because he had to talk to [[No-Karo]]. [[The Burning Sons]] are pretty mad at us, but he doesn't think he's mad at us. He gives each of us a [[Pelor Token]] in case we ever need anything from him. [[Tanim]] is the [[Moradin]] oracle, he's "testy". [[Rhehned]] is the oracle for [[Bahamut]], an old blue dragonborn. These are the only gods he knows of with oracles. They all have watchers, different ones than his. 

### Baddies (we can only assume)
* [[Colvia Ghul]]
	* Apparently has spent a lot of time in [[Turian Waste]]. Why??

### Other Players
* [[Gu’athrithen]]
	* [[Gauthoc]] (a contact for [[Clarence the Cleaner]]) is the only blue draconic our party knows, but might be a connection if we end up in [[Gu’athrithen]]
	* The blue draconics that attacked the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] airship were able to get some papers, schematics of some of the border facilities on the desk.
* [[Deregheir]] 
	* [[Lee]] is [[Rez]]'s brother and lives there. He said not to get involved, but when does [[Rez]] ever listen to him anyways?
