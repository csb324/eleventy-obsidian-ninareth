# Julian Wants Damiens Pipe
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Complete</span></span>

## Background
[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] told [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] that he needed us to do a job for him - go find a former "associate" of his outside [[Tinzelven]], named [[Damien]], and offer him a choice:

1) Let us take his magic pipe and continue living in [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s house 
2) Leave [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s house, and pay off his debt

## Who's Involved
* [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]
	* Agreed, [[Damien]]'s debts our paid, but seems to have plans to find him again in the future
* [[Henrik]]
	* 
* [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]]
	* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]
	* [[Costi]]
* [[Damien]]

## Consequences

As payment  for our services, [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] gave us the jewelry from [[Damien]]. The [[Amulet of Blasting]], and a [[ring of protection]], and some assorted jelwery.

### Source (copy+paste guide)
we finally approached [[Damien]]'s home, surrounded by a graveyard that did not feel entirely dead. [[Damien]] came out with a crossbow leveled at us.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] told him she just wanted to talk, and explained that while they were there on [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s behalf, they were not necessarily committed to working in his interests. Finally, he allowed us to come inside, if we left our weapons at the door. 

[[Damien]] did not trust anything coming from [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], which, *fair*. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] wanted his property back *or* the flute, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] reminded [[Damien]] that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] doesn't give up easily. [[Damien]] said Julian had no right to demand anything from him, and showed [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] the records he'd kept of the payments he'd been making on the initial loan that got him into this situation, but the interest outpaced his payments. And, as [[Costi]] reminded him, [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] will twist the terms to mean whatever he wants them to mean.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] pointed out that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] didn't care about the property until [[Damien]] got this [[Magical Flute]]. So, if someone wanted to keep [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] from getting what he wants, it would make sense for that person to maybe give up the property instead of the [[Magical Flute]], right?

(By the way, [[Damien]] was not alone. He seemed to have a whole bunch of undead figures around to keep him company. He spoke to some in infernal, which [[Costi]] understood.)

[[Costi]] volunteered that he intended to kill [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] someday, and if he did, [[Damien]] could get the flute back. [[Damien]] didn't seem to think this was likely to happen, but he was very interested in whether [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was on board with the killing-Julian plan. 

Regardless, we were *really* there to talk about his *music*. So we asked to hear the *cutting-edge* stuff he'd been creating, and we managed to be sufficiently persuasive about it ([[Rez]], at least, was genuinely curious). So he played us something on an instrument of his own creation... *The Saws*. 

(See what I did there with "cutting edge"?? Thanks, I'm proud of it.)

It was rough to listen to. But [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] suggested the sound would carry beautifully across the forest, and perhaps this specific space was holding him back creatively. [[Costi]] suggested breaking the instrument apart at the end of the piece in a violent explosion. [[Damien]] liked the second idea. Whatever. 

After trying out [[Costi]]'s shattering-saws technique (and realizing the echoes *do* layer interestingly in a larger space), [[Damien]] came around to the idea that maybe we were here to help. He called to his undead buddies and told them "We're moving." To pay off the rest of his debts, some of the skeletons pooled together the jewelry they were buried with! Such sweet skeletons.

As we were leaving, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tried to get a bit more information out of [[Damien]] about how he and [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] worked together. [[Damien]] said he'd really only done one job for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], with [[Sienna Burbank]] and [[Cliff Burbank]] and [[a guy whose name was or wasnt Jimbothy]], and a [[girl who played the bagpipes]], and maybe someone else? They were all at [[Redscale]] at the same time. Damien said that [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] was always nice, and that [[Cliff Burbank|Clifford]] was a douchebag.
