# The  Zephyra Affair
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

[[Zephyra]], who works at [[The Gilded Instrument]], offered to waive the 3000 gold fee to fix [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp, in exchange for a favor. That favor was tracking down some of her old criminal companions, the [[Arazoak]], who had turned up in [[Jalantar]]. We found them, and fought with some distraction-monsters as they fled. 

It appears they all (including [[Zephyra]], but not including [[Kara]]) were captured by the [[Zalevi Military]] and brought to the [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar]] for extradition. They are believed alive, since their execution would be a big deal in [[Zalev]]. [[Kara]] plans to break them all out, and does not want [[Our Party]] involved. 

It turns out, the harp could be repaired for 400 gold, so, this is no longer a tremendous concern, although it's still not great.
