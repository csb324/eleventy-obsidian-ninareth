### What We've Been Told
Interrogation of [[Nicky]] by [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] revealed [[ELA]] has hidden camps 3 days SW of the [[Burbank Compound]], and we won't travel by the roads. [[Cliff Burbank]] recommends we be persuasive, careful, and follow [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]'s orders to the letter. He also says [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] has always followed his tasks exactly, and has very loyal men beneath him. We are encouraged to report back afterward to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] and be sure we give our full report, with the subtext it could be safer for us to have our reasoning and path laid out - he might not be the only eyes on our story.

832 troops are going, from the [[Eberronian Seventh Brigade]]. 

### The Search
[[Eberronian Seventh Brigade]] plans to grid search to comb out hints of [[ELA]] camps, with 80 groups of around 10 to look for signs. They will decide how to eradicate the camps once they are found - with the goal to "bring back 90% heads 10% captives". 

[[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] and his core sergeants will each own key areas with a contingent of troop of about 200 each:
* [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] will be in the center, near the ruined town [[Golstrava]]
* [[Colvia Ghul]] is near the ravines
* [[Fingers]] is left of the ruins in a marshy area
* Interspersed throughout will be led by [[Dispek Dradleston]], seemingly to help with operating strategy.

We've learned that the [[ELA]] in this area is largely based in [[Golstrava]], ruins of a town that was destroyed in [[The Three Dragons War]]. 

### The Defense
[[Devkorus Kaa]] has asked us to stay undercover until the attack on [[Golstrava]] -- Keep passing information to them, and slow the military down if we can, but don't actively interfere with the [[Eberronian Seventh Brigade]], because if we get caught that's just a big waste for everybody. 

### What People Want

#### [[ELA]]
Information we've shared:
* Exact numbers of troops - 832
* other notable names - [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], [[Colvia Ghul]], [[Fingers]], [[Dispek Dradleston]],
* time of departure - 8 am 
* note 12 hours before leaving compound - sent
* regular updates once gone - every 6 hours, then asked for more flexibility to avoid being caught

For further information, we were told by [[Costi's mom]], "keep a low profile and do your best to communicate your specific position, someone will find you. Keep him ([[Costi]]) safe"

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] found a passageway in some large boulders around 10 hours outside of the [[Burbank Compound]], and when asked were told "It would be better if the [[Eberronian Military]] did not know about that passage" - but felt we couldn't conceal it, so [[Colvia Ghul]] is now aware. We need to give them a heads up it's compromised. 

We also asked [[Pruvki Forgaveat]] if the [[ELA]] is doing magical experimentation to create half/not-but-sorta undead. They are not, to his knowledge, and we owe him a response lol.

#### [[Eberronian Second Division]]
They want to comb out hints of camps, will have 80 groups of around 10 to look for signs of the camps. He is not from [[Eberron]]. We will decide how to eradicate them once we find them. [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] wants to bring back 90% heads 10% captives. 

We'll be under Sgt [[Colvia Ghul]] - human in robes. We'll be with 5 of her "trusted devotees," making up a tine. She'll be our lead, and any of our info should go through her first. It's been made clear that she'll be with us the whole time, and is leaning into counter-terrorism work - she wants to pick our brains.

## Questions
Literally why is the 7th brigade loyal? I've never seen a strategy worse for morale than "beat everyone all the time for no reason." Only [[Fingers]] seems to be having a good time and I'm pretty sure she's a psychopath.
