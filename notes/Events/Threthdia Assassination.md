<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

[[Threthdia Scrivit]] wants to kill us. Why? Because we killed [[Jecka]]! It turns out, [[Threthdia Scrivit]] is a hag or something -- one of the [[The Beauties of Shadow]], and probably the leader. 

### Friends and Foes
* [[The Curator]] (see: [[session-45]])
	* Gave us the [[Curator Quills]] 
	* Told us 
* [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] 
	* Offering an alibi for [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]]
*
