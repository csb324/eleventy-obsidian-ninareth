# Threthdia Assassination
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

## Background
[[Threthdia Scrivit]] wants to kill us. Why? Because we killed [[Jecka]]! It turns out, [[Threthdia Scrivit]] is a hag or something -- one of the [[The Beauties of Shadow]], and probably the leader. 

## Who's Involved

### Baddies
* [[Threthdia Scrivit]] 
	* the hag of the hour
	* Hates [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] 
* [[Jecka]]
	* former beauty of shadow
	* [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] killed her
	* Was draining [[Rian]] from [[The Miscasts]]
	* We stole some goodies off her body
		* A little leather [[Bag of Screams]]
		* [[Circlet of Sending]] 
		* A [[Beauties of Shadow Dog Tag|dog tag]] reading [[The Beauties of Shadow]]

### Helpers
* [[The Curator]] (see: [[Sessions/session-45]])
	* Gave us the [[Curator Quills]] 
	* Told us that Threthdia's House is probably bigger on the inside, if you know what I mean.
* [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] 
	* Offering an alibi for [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]]
* [[Bel]] and [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Klida]]
	* Gave us more information about hags
	* They're probably always watching us, and are known for keeping grudges. 
	* Warned covens are extremely dangeous and magically powerful. 
	* [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] says they're stronger when they're together, that if we kill one they're all weaker. Also believes they've probably filled their vanacy caused by [[Jecka]]'s death by now

## Strategy 
* Look for the other twins to the [[Circlet of Sending]]
* Everyone team up on the same hag gal at once (since they get less powerful without each other)
* [[Freya]] should use all three of those quills
	* on her ice pick?
	* on one of the hags? 
* [[Jecka]] loved animating objects
	* [[Costi]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] should be ready to shatter some shit 
	* folks should plan to get behind cover
* Light all of our lanterns before entering
* Look out for collateral or hostages for draining like [[Jecka]] did
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] divine sense to help us find them
* Why does she seem so interested in [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]??
	* thought it was becuase we used the circlet, but that's most of [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] by now
	* does she really like/hate bards?
