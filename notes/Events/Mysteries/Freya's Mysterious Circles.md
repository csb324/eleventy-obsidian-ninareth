# Freya's Mysterious Circles

When [[Freya]] was framed for some kind of crime (unclear) and left [[True North]], she received a note. The note had two symbols on it -- the symbol of the [[Wayfinders]], and these circles. 

[[Freya]] asked [[Niko]] to look into it for her. He gave her a piece of paper that would allow one-way communication, and then incinerate itself, so that he could communicate securely.

[[session-30]]: [[Niko]] got back to her, and said [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] recognized the symbol. He couldn't say exactly what it was, but it was something that probably existed in his research. So, that's something!

Update: [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] had seen the symbol in the margins of a book: [[The Unnatural Naturality]]. That book was purchased at [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]], in [[Arkhosia (City)]]. Klipitz gave [[Freya]] the book to keep.

[[notes-60]]: We went to [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]]! [[Kildee]] told [[Freya]] that he was sold this book by [[Caleb Schleuse]], a halfling scholar who studied at [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]]. It was a bit weird of him to sell a book with so much of his own research in the margins, but Kildee doesn't ask questions, Kildee buys and sells books. 

[[Jade]] took a look at the symbol in the margins of [[The Unnatural Naturality]] (a book she is *very* interested in). Her glasses turned dark. So that's something.

[[Kildee]] said he would find [[Caleb Schleuse]] for us -- apparently he's from the [[Driftrock]], so, hopefully he hasn't gone too far and we can talk to him soon.
