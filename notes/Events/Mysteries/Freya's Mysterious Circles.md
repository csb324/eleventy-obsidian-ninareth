# Freya's Mysterious Circles

When [[Freya]] was framed for some kind of crime (unclear) and left [[True North]], she received a note. The note had two symbols on it -- the symbol of the [[Wayfinders]], and these circles. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] legends lore the circles, hears a calm reassuring voice, "these infinite overlapping circles are the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]. It is the symbol of [[Morthos]] and denotes an individual, object, or place that is under their influence. Where goes the eye, there goes their power. It observes the degradation of our most natural and fundamental lines and is a harbinger of the greatest doom" - [[notes-123]]
### Connections
* [[Morthos]] and [[The Silver Hand]]
* [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]
* [[There's Plainly Something Wrong with the Planes]]
* [[Drimbias Shaziros]]
* [[Winifey]], the [[Duvey Crypt]], and the [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]]
* [[Wayfinders]]: [[Naya]], [[Akros]], and [[Rawley]]
* [[Samson]] knew about them from [[Home]] and told [[Eirian]] and [[Ghez Yhutl]] - they found a dead body with them
* [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]]
* It was found trying to [[Heal the Anchor Tree]]
* Found [[Halls of the Dead]]
* [[Zhakastin Expedition]]
* [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]]

### Clues
[[session-30]]: [[Niko]] got back to her, and said [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] recognized the symbol. He couldn't say exactly what it was, but it was something that probably existed in his research. So, that's something!

Update: [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] had seen the symbol in the margins of a book: [[The Unnatural Naturality]]. That book was purchased at [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]], in [[Arkhosia (City)]]. Klipitz gave [[Freya]] the book to keep.

[[notes-60]]: We went to [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]]! [[Kildee]] told [[Freya]] that he was sold this book by [[Caleb Schleuse]], a halfling scholar who studied at [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]]. It was a bit weird of him to sell a book with so much of his own research in the margins, but Kildee doesn't ask questions, Kildee buys and sells books. 

[[Jade]] took a look at the symbol in the margins of [[The Unnatural Naturality]] (a book she is *very* interested in). Her glasses turned dark. So that's something.

[[Kildee]] said he would find [[Caleb Schleuse]] for us -- apparently he's from the [[Driftrock]], so, hopefully he hasn't gone too far and we can talk to him soon.

[[notes-75]] We spoke to [[Caleb Schleuse]], who didn't know what it was. He originally encountered it in an auto-biography by [[Drimbias Shaziros]]. She's said to be a high-elf born in the [[City of Brass]]. Maybe tied to [[Morthos]] or the [[The Silver Hand]]? 

[[Naya]] and [[Akros]] seem very insistent that [[Freya]] (with the help of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]) "glean information" from [[Kith and Kin]], and discuss it with them, at the latest at the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]]

[[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and [[Magister]] both did not recognize it, but will do some digging, subtly

[[The Curator]] reminds [[Freya]] that the only information they can access is that the collection can get, and they're still working to get anything more specific. They say it's seems as though not everyone in [[Polaris]] cannot be trusted - [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]] was given to her by one of the [[Keepers]]. Why would they put the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]? Maybe it's because they wanted her to be warned. [[The Curator]] can only confirm that [[Freya]] has a friend in the [[Keepers]]. 

[[Rez]] sends to [[Samson]], "I'm [[Rez]]! Welcome!! You know my sister, [[Eirian|E]]! You sound so interesting, I have a bunch of questions but FIRST - can you tell me what you know about the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles |Mysterious Circles]] and the guy you found dead? You heard him talk about them? You can tell me whatever you tell her!!!", he replies: "[[Rez]], it is SO nice to met you! I’ve heard so much, YOU sound so interesting. I hope we get to meet soon! Shoot, that’s a lot to unpack. [[Lorvak Nestle]], bookseller in [[Thelran Asari]], looking for something for my daughter and found book with [[Freya's Mysterious Circles |Mysterious Circles]]! Planned a coffee to talk, but he died before. Found his body, seemed murdered."

 [[Buddy the Bear]] recognizes [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] and thinks maybe it was [[Balsandor]], a few times. There's also been a few times that he saw non-firbolgs. A few humanoids, human sized and a few even bigger. Seems like it's been floating around [[Polaris]].

[[Wyn Elreal]] say them in [[New Fairhaven]], blood was coating the whole area and streaming from the eye in the center of the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]]. He shared this update with the elders at the [[The Boundless Grove|Boundless Grove]], but isn't sure of follow-up outside of looking for [[Von]]. He says he killed a humanoid with the gold finger, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] draws [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] to see if he recognizes it - to which he replies it keeps him up at night. She confirms it was found on one of [[G'zraad]] followers. 

We found a copy while [[Heal the Anchor Tree]], looking at the root where [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] emerged, and where the void used to be, we see strange symbols carved into the bark. They're in a tight geometric shape, with clearly seen lines along the bottom and sides, making a tapering trapezoid shape. The one at the top is [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]], and in the center of that shape there is a dull red stone, it is similar to the [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]] but has no magic coming out of this, unlike the ruby eye. [[Rhynilex]] asks what [[Freya]] knows about the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] symbol around [[Bagath Mizzragon]]'s neck. [[Freya]] shares about finding the note from [[Polaris]] and says she's been searching for answers the last 2 years. She asks her to keep it a secret as much as she can, and that we've found it in places with other undead. [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] says she'll tell [[The Matron]] in case it connects to a future threat against [[Izdeke]].

[[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Mysterious Circles]] were carved into [[Winifey]]'s back. As [[Cinder]] pierces the [[Ring of Efreet Summoning]] [[Jade]]'s glasses flash ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]?), her briefcase pulls out a card referencing [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]]. 

In the [[Halls of the Dead]] A body hung furthest in the room is missing his left hand.  The one near the skeleton's magic has a [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]], after 'checking' [[Jade]] goes to grab it and discovers it's connected somehow, but pulls with a mucus-covered tendon where it seemed to be attached internally. [[Jade]]'s glasses flash ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]?) and she notices on the back of the ruby, is a symbol [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]].
