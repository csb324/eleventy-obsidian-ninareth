# Freya's Mysterious Circles

When [[Freya]] was framed for some kind of crime (unclear) and left [[True North]], she received a note. The note had two symbols on it -- the symbol of the [[Wayfinders]], and these circles. 

[[Freya]] asked [[Niko]] to look into it for her. He gave her a piece of paper that would allow one-way communication, and then incinerate itself, so that he could communicate securely.

The incense takes on a purple tint, and [[Hugh|Finn]] hears a calm reassuring voice, "these infinite overlapping circles are the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]]]. It is the symbol of [[Morthos]] and denotes an individual, object, or place that is under their influence. Where goes the eye, there goes their power. It observes the degradation of our most natural and fundamental lines and is a harbinger of the greatest doom"
### Connections
* [[Morthos]] and [[The Silver Hand]]
* [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]
* [[There's Plainly Something Wrong with the Planes]]
* [[Drimbias Shaziros]]
* [[Winifey]], the [[Duvey Crypt]], and the [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]]
* [[Wayfinders]]: [[Naya]], [[Akros]], and [[Rawley]]
* [[Samson]] knew about them from [[Home]] and told [[Eirian]] and [[Ghez Yhutl]] - they found a dead body with them
* [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]]

### Clues
[[session-30]]: [[Niko]] got back to her, and said [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] recognized the symbol. He couldn't say exactly what it was, but it was something that probably existed in his research. So, that's something!

Update: [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] had seen the symbol in the margins of a book: [[The Unnatural Naturality]]. That book was purchased at [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]], in [[Arkhosia (City)]]. Klipitz gave [[Freya]] the book to keep.

[[notes-60]]: We went to [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]]! [[Kildee]] told [[Freya]] that he was sold this book by [[Caleb Schleuse]], a halfling scholar who studied at [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]]. It was a bit weird of him to sell a book with so much of his own research in the margins, but Kildee doesn't ask questions, Kildee buys and sells books. 

[[Jade]] took a look at the symbol in the margins of [[The Unnatural Naturality]] (a book she is *very* interested in). Her glasses turned dark. So that's something.

[[Kildee]] said he would find [[Caleb Schleuse]] for us -- apparently he's from the [[Driftrock]], so, hopefully he hasn't gone too far and we can talk to him soon.

[[notes-75]] We spoke to [[Caleb Schleuse]], who didn't know what it was. He originally encountered it in an auto-biography by [[Drimbias Shaziros]]. She's said to be a high-elf born in the [[City of Brass]]. Maybe tied to [[Morthos]] or the [[The Silver Hand]]? 

[[Naya]] and [[Akros]] seem very insistent that [[Freya]] (with the help of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]) "glean information" from [[Kith and Kin]], and discuss it with them, at the latest at the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]]

[[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and [[Magister]] both did not recognize it, but will do some digging, subtly
