#  Whats up with Jade's Glasses
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

## What we know
[[Jade]] was given a pair of glasses (technically a pince-nez, if we're being specific) by [[The Curator]]. They seem to allow her to recieve messages from... someone else. The lenses darken momentarily when she looks at something *interesting*. Interesting how? Unclear.

We know her glasses almost always give a clue card most closely related to that exact moment. 

It seems like [[The Curator]] can't see what [[Jade]] is doing the same way when the glasses are blocked or off. 

### Times this has happened:
* When Jade saw [[Josh|Jinx]] for the first time
* When Jade saw [[Relakas]] for the first time
* When Jade saw [[The Unforged Few]] for the first time
* When Jade saw [[Winifey]] at [[Flounder's]].
* When Jade looked in the direction of [[Willow|our invisible pursuer]].
* When Jade saw the [[Mysterious Circles]] in the margin of [[The Unnatural Naturality]]. 

[[The Curator]] has said that they can see through [[Jade]]'s eyes. 

## Questions

* Who is sending these messages
* Why
