### Hmmmm
* When [[Jade]] investigated [[Hugh]] having some cleric issues after killing a woman in battle, she pulled a card related to not just [[Moradin]], but two other of [[The Ascended]]: [[Corellon Larethian]] and [[Pelor]] 
* [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] is creating ground breaking technology to connect to other planes?
* [[The Unnatural Naturality]] is starting to come up a lot. 
* We don't know this but Tim's arc
* The [[Fire Raisers]] seem to have opened up some kind of portal to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]
* [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] may represent overlapping planes
* We've seen two augmented giants: sylvan with a twig inside it, and a half-undead with the green vial
* There was a portal to  [[The Shadowfell]] in the [[Turian Waste]] near the [[Zhakastin Expedition]]. It turns out, that was [[Mr. Blueberry]]’s skylight. [[Kaycee Teapetal|Kaycee]] put it there, with a sword called “Planesrender”. (Rez convinced her to move the portal but uhhhhh)
