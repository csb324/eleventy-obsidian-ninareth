## What we know

> [[Victoria Several]] tells us to generally not talk about blood magic. She confirms that it's something she does. A few years back, Magister and Victoria were out working on things and came across a very interesting book. It had some instructions on how to increase your power, and it turns out her lineage's blood works well. Magister and Victoria's associate made the gun that Vask uses, it's not the same thing. She says using someone ELSE's blood is fucked up, blood carries power and life and magic. [[Rez]] asks how someone can protect yourself, if someone has your blood. They say that if a powerful person uses them, they have a great degree of control over you.

> There hasn't been a powerful blood mage in about hundreds of years, and so it might not be as big of a risk. The last known was about 200 years ago. People debate if there were multiple blood mages, or if it was the same person, but there are some names associated: [[the Swiftwards|Amelia Swiftward]], Maevin Wyrmwood, Mathis, and some tomes signed by "H". Some believe that its an old wives tale, but Victora thinks it's probably true.

[[Freya]] gave [[The Curator]] some of her blood, in exchange for aid in the [[Threthdia Assassination]]. So, that's a bit concerning.

## What we don't know
* Lol who's Maevin Wyrmwood?
* Who has Freya's blood?
* ... a lot else.
