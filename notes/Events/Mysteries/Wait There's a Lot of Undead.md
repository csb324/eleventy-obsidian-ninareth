# Wait There's a Lot of Undead
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

* [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]]
	* Stained glass portraits of [[The Raven Queen]], [[Vecna]], and [[Morthos]] 
	* [[Morthos]] has something to do with [[dunamancy]]
	* [[Magister]] told us about [[The Silver Hand]], an organization that was led by a woman named [[Opal (silver hand)|Opal]] 
* [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]
	* The [[Beating Heart Battalion]], which [[Hugh]] was in (and presumably [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] was also in) was a specifically non-undead military unit
* [[Southern Cities Increase Tension]]
	* #helpmechelsea remind me why this is relevant to undead!
* [[Jalantar Sunspot]]: There was a stone summoning ghosts to the basement.
* [[Mysterious Circles]] 
	* OOC
* [[Victoria Several]] 1/2 OOC
	* She's got some secret necklace
* [[Magister]] 
* [[Eberron]]
	* They love undead stuff
* [[Damien]]
	* Lived in a graveyard, and seemed friendly with the undead he summoned
* [[Julian Wants Damiens Pipe]]
	* The pipe seemed to have undead-related powers, based on how much [[Damien]] liked it. Why does [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] want something like that? Unclear.
* [[Fire Raisers]] 
	* taking a bunch of [[The Guardians]] uniforms
		* The idea here is that they would raise dead, put the zombies in the uniforms, and then say "Look, [[The Guardians]] are necromancers!"
		* We don't have a ton of evidence for this one
	* The mention in the [[From the Ashes Flyer]] 
		* "Terminate diplomatic relations with both [[Eberron]] and [[Zalev]] until they end their internationally recognized practices of the nonconsensual manipulation of the undead, and lifetime involuntary servitude, respectively.""
* [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] selling "art" to [[Rhicka Surtev]] from [[Eberronian Military]]
	* [[El'Haliand]] and [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]]
	* [[Sienna Burbank]] and [[Cliff Burbank]] 
	* Wants [[Costi]] really badly, maybe that's actually tied to [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]
* [[Our Fiend Samuel]]
* [[Freya]]'s desecrated spot from [[The Curator]]
	* [[Jade]] has the same thing
* [[Ichlior]]
	* A few hundred years ago, [[Ichlior]] family purchased the [[Chapel of the Lost]] and turned it into a hotel. 
* We don't know this but Tim's arc
* [[Duvey Crypt]]
	* Seemed similar to the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]]
	* Found the [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]] with [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] carved on it
	* Goblins were being kept half-alive in some sort of necromantic ritual
* [[Winifey]]
	* Had [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] carved on her back 


### Who's Doing This?
* [[Fire Raisers]] seem to dislike that in general
	* But who actually runs them?
* Are [[The Silver Hand]] still around? Looks like it!

### Notes of Potential Concern
* Try not to piss off [[The Raven Queen]] in our [[Death Halls Heist]] - maybe if we kill enough undead down there she won't mind us impersonating her flock to desecrate a grave??? 
	* turns out to be the opposite - [[Costi]] is a devotee now!
