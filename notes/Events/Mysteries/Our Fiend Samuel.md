# Our Fiend Samuel
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

## Background
Using her new ties to [[Corellon Larethian]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] felt something new from [[Samuel]] - he's a fiend?

## Who's Involved
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]
	* Tied to tempt [[Samuel]] into a conversation with pie crusts. She tries to determine if he has strong feelings about revealing his origin, but it doesn't seem to land. 
	* Broke news to [[Costi]] and [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] about [[Samuel]]'s true origin.
* [[Costi]]
	* Unsure what to think
* [[Samuel]]
	* Birb no more - turns out he's a fiend
	* Won't say much. Then again, he can't really talk
	* Still seems loyal to [[Costi]]
* [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]
	* Was a warlock
* [[Klaus]] ([[Srictha]]'s bird)
	* We should maybe check and see what another bird famliar is, maybe he's also a fiend? 

## Things to Note
in [[session-46]] [[Samuel]] seems to have some serious trouble existing in the Feywild. He announces his displeasure, and struggle to eat a beetle, before taking a lap of the lake so [[Costi]] can check it out.
