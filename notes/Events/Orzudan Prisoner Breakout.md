[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] cuts some [[Chain of Orzudan]] at a [[blacksite]] in [[Fort Studtrodd]] after [[Freya]] was directed there by [[The Curator]]. Now we see what happens! 

### What We Know
Framing them for the [[blacksite]] worked in our favor, but she's not sure what happened as a result of that attack was. She believes some prisoners were released, at least temporarily, from [[Orzudan]]. However, at least one person that she knew to be 'inactive', [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] is out and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] is out trying to bring her back in. She's a rogue necromancer who's done a lot of harm. It's been 9 years since she was heard from, but appeared in a village near [[Orzudan]].

### Cut [[Chain of Orzudan]] 
There are 368, 47 has been cut by [[Freya]]. 
* [[Finn]] - 222 
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] - 37 (note: she rolled above 20)
* [[Rez]] - 135, 136, 137 (note: she rolled above 20, but cut 3, so maybe that doesn't matter?)

### Those Involved
* [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]
* [[Clarence the Cleaner]] 
* [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]]
* [[The Curator]]
	* Told [[Freya]] of the existence of the [[blacksite]] and asked her to cut chain #47 
* [[Sven]]
	* Maybe in charge of the Guardians of [[Orzudan]]? 
	* Gave the warforged a collar that was a status symbol
	* "he put it on, only he can take it off", [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] "and where is he now?", he responds, "Probably [[Eberron City]]". It's magical, and cannot be removed.
* Warforged on duty (RIP)
	* Said he's been in operation at the [[blacksite]] at [[Fort Studtrodd]] for about 130 years.

### Prisoners
* [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] 
	* She's a rogue necromancer who's done a lot of harm.
	* Formerly known to be 'inactive' and now spotted out for the first time in 9 years. Appeared in a village near [[Orzudan]].
	* [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] is out trying to bring her back in. 
* [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]
	* At the point our friends were trying to figure out how to free him, there was a [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]] and his door just opened! He was escorted by a few people in guards uniform but in the pandemonium was able to escape. 
* 2 killed
* 1 caught shortly after
* 1 more at large
