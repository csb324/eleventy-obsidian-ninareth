#  Death Halls Heist
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Upcoming</span></span>

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] wants [[The Unforged Few]] to steal a cool mirror from the [[Halls of the Dead]]

## The Cool Mirrors
There's a bigger one and a smaller one. They were buried with [[Sheske Eeping]], and the larger one is [[notes-57|"helpful to make a gentleman look his best before the elections."]] 

## What We Know
* Through a generous donation you can visit whoever you want. 
* You're paid to be taken to a specific place.
* Operates through a lift similiar to the on in use at the [[Chapel of the Lost]], with a row of buttons: it goes up to 12, and down to 50. Runs through a key
	 * On the 7th floor, there seems to be desk outside
	 * There is a separate lift to go both up and down, the administrative lift starts on the second floor and the same for the cypts below.
* Employs death workers who move with caskets, who have a uniform of ash grab robes.
* We should expect protections from grave robbers
* We learn [[Heestal Eeping]] was buried on the 36th floor

### About the Raven Queen
* [[Hugh]] reads the [[Book on Preparing Dead Bodies]], [[The Raven Queen]] focuses on burial, and believe that the dead body is a vessel to be protected. There's mostly crypts, some mausoleums too. They don't normally bury people with things, it's unnecessary. They treat bodies with respect, guarding them between one day and a week. Bodies are cleaned, gentle reposed, and dressed in black with a ravens feather somewhere, so they can be watched as part of the flock. 
* Death workers usually start by joining the [[Death Watchers]] and taking posts, proving their committment by staying awake. After a year or two they take a pilgrimage to move up. [[Hugh]] heard them discussing "under her wing" as common language. "The moment of passage" is another key phrase as a central tenant to the religion. The pilgrimage is called [[the March]]
* [[Costi]] learns that [[Viardel Brensaschi]] was the most recent former [[Matron of Ravens]] who is the official cult leader of [[The Raven Queen]]. There's not really a home base, they're nomadic and relatively unpopular, but they all almost have martial training as one of their two primary goals is the destruction of all undead. She lived most of her life in [[Eberron]] were she was highly hunted by the state. She was succeeded by her first disciple, [[Kan Gluknan]], a hobgoblin. She was from [[The Tendrils]], ravens followed her, she was kicked out of her town as a child and eventually was taken in by the cult. She was a prolific vampire hunter, and the book takes credit for the murder of [[Count Hisir Rorsik]] which was infamous in [[Eberron]]. 

[[Costi]] reads more of [[The Ascended]] and learns that the Eastern Tinkante Raven was the breed that [[The Raven Queen]] had as a familiar, but he learns that the now-extinct Western Tinkante Raven (like [[Samuel]]) which has distinct head tufting and the beak shape was an almond instead of circle. He knows she's the last of the Ascended gods, she traveled into [[The Abyss]] where she battled with [[Orcus]] for about 1,000 years to earn her immortality. She's now mortal enemies with [[Vecna]] and [[Orcus]]. 

### Things to Figure Out
* Problem:  It costs money to visit a tomb in the [[Halls of the Dead]]. Potentially up to 3500 gold, and that's if we can convincingly say that we're all loved ones of whoever we're visiting. 
	* We're gonna fight in the [[Fishermen]] Fighting pits!
* Problem: Visitors are usually escorted by a member of staff
* Problem: How do we get to the right level?
* Problem: How do we find the right tomb?
	* find object? 
* Problem: How do we break into the vault?
* Problem: How do we get out, once we complete the mission?
* Problem: Know that [[Sheske Eeping]] was the target?
	* Steal other things so that we don't be clear

### Things that Might Also be Helpful
* The [[Skeleton Key]], perhaps, if we encounter a very locked door.
* The [[Deck of Illusions]], perhaps, if we need to distract somebody
* Bring back the feathers of the two fallen [[Death's Watchers]] 

## Our Plan

### How to Get In
* [[Costi]], with his outfit o' feathers, working with [[The Raven Queen]] disciples?
* [[Costi]] use his borrow knowledge?
* [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] connect us with some friends? Also has a dead relative there:  [[La Monte Rafaldrick]]
* Steal a key and robes from some of the death workers? Put one of us in a cask? 

### What We Do With the Mirrors?
* [[Hugh]] identify them 
* Carry them out in [[my hole]]
* Should we try to prevent [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] from fully getting these? 

### One Option
* We got to [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]] to read about where people study to take care of the dead / famous [[The Raven Queen]] facilities
* Find a plausible story to be students, in training to be death workers
* Go to the [[Halls of the Dead]], in the gray robes, ask for a training tour, maybe with [[Costi]] being an altered-self [[The Raven Queen]] guy? Or one of the talkers in his clothes? 

### Another 
* be a pilgram, spy a death worker as they're leaving
* follow them and steal their key
* same disguises as above, go back and confidently walk, get on the elevator
* hope for the best
