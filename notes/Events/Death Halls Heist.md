#  Death Halls Heist
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Upcoming</span></span>

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] wants [[The Unforged Few]] to steal a cool mirror from the [[Halls of the Dead]]

## The Cool Mirrors
There's a bigger one and a smaller one. They were buried with [[Sheske Eeping]], and the larger one is [[notes-57|"helpful to make a gentleman look his best before the elections."]] 

## What We Know
* Through a generous donation you can visit whoever you want. 
* You're paid to be taken to a specific place.
* Operates through a lift similiar to the on in use at the [[Chapel of the Lost]], with a row of buttons: it goes up to 12, and down to 50. Runs through a key
	 * On the 7th floor, there seems to be desk outside
	 * There is a separate lift to go both up and down, the administrative lift starts on the second floor and the same for the cypts below.
* Employs death workers who move with caskets, who have a uniform of ash grab robes.
* We should expect protections from grave robbers
* We learn [[Heestal Eeping]] was buried on the 36th floor

### Things to Figure Out
* Problem:  It costs money to visit a tomb in the [[Halls of the Dead]]. Potentially up to 3500 gold, and that's if we can convincingly say that we're all loved ones of whoever we're visiting. 
	* We're gonna fight in the [[Fishermen]] Fighting pits!
* Problem: Visitors are usually escorted by a member of staff
* Problem: How do we get to the right level?
* Problem: How do we find the right tomb?
* Problem: How do we break into the vault?
* Problem: How do we get out, once we complete the mission?
* Problem: Know that [[Sheske Eeping]] was the target?
	* Steal other things so that we don't be clear

### Things that Might Also be Helpful
* The [[Skeleton Key]], perhaps, if we encounter a very locked door.
* The [[Deck of Illusions]], perhaps, if we need to distract somebody

## Our Plan

### How to Get In
* [[Costi]], with his outfit o' feathers, working with [[The Raven Queen]] disciples?
* [[Costi]] use his borrow knowledge?
* [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] connect us with some friends? Also has a dead relative there:  [[La Monte Rafaldrick]]
* Steal a key and robes from some of the death workers? Put one of us in a cask? 

### What We Do With the Mirrors?
* [[Hugh]] identify them 
* Carry them out in [[my hole]]
* Should we try to prevent [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] from fully getting these? 

### One Option
* We got to [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]] to read about where people study to take care of the dead / famous [[The Raven Queen]] facilities
* Find a plausible story to be students, in training to be death workers
* Go to the [[Halls of the Dead]], in the gray robes, ask for a training tour, maybe with [[Costi]] being an altered-self [[The Raven Queen]] guy? Or one of the talkers in his clothes? 

### Another 
* be a pilgram, spy a death worker as they're leaving
* follow them and steal their key
* same disguises as above, go back and confidently walk, get on the elevator
* hope for the best
