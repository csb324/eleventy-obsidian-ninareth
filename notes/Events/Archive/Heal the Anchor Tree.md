## Prophecies and Touches

#### [[The Burning Sons]] / [[The Burning Sons]]
"below the depths, roots of oldest anchor, aching, leaking, empty, bled for power. Lores touches together, patch, mend the tear, and set sun's light anew no worse for wear. When time is right, worlds assigned, veils are thin, the sun shall shine, and those died fight again"

[[Pelor's Touch]]
#### [[Bahamat's Party]]
"Below the depths, crews of oldest anchor, aching, peeking, empty bled for power. Core touches together, patch rend and tear, and set things right for you but worse for wear. In black of night, wills align, veils are thin, scales will harden, sun will rise, fight again"

[[Bahamat's Touch]]
#### [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]
"below the depths, roots of oldest anchor, aching, leaking, empty, bled for power" then later "the four touches together, patch, mend the tear, and set things right, anew no worse for wear" "when time is right, worlds align, veils are thin, strings will sing, and what will rise fights again".

[[Larethian Rose]]
#### Dwarven Party
"Below the depths, roots of oldest anchor. aching leaking empty bled for power. Four touches together, patch, mend the tear, and set things right, anew no worse for wear. When time is right, wills align, nails and tin, metal tempered, those that died fight again."

[[Moradin's Touch]]

## What We Know

[[Githyanki Stone Tablet]] "On the trail of [[G'zraad]], the Ilithid is separate from it's people. Vulnerable. Likelihood of establishing new elderbrain 19%. Path almost complete" 

[[Hugh]] casts Divination and asks [[TrueSilver]], "Would taking down the Ilithid named [[G'zraad]] be beneficial in our goal of curing the anchor tree?", In the flames [[Hugh]] sees a line of brown begin to take shape, brown craggy fire, as it connects to the ground - at the base a black flame emerge. It expands across the rough brown flame. Standing over top of it, there's a flickering purple shape, arms out-stretched. As it's arms raise the black gets larger. Then it all returns to the usual shape.
