The [[Fire Raisers]] intended to blow up four different spots in the Delegates Day parade. [[The Unforged Few]], with help from [[Giary]], the [[Concerned Fire Raisers]] and [[First Officer Ghent]], were able to stop the bombs.



### What We Know
* Potential targets:
	* [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]]
	* [[Sill Dockhouse]]
	* [[Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser]]
* Method:
	* 8 bombs? 
		* Fuses from [[Ulia Glorsbade]]
		* barrels of "3434"
	* Illusions assisted by [[Rhend Triverswill]]


### Clues to Investigate
* [[Flyte]] in the [[Irralsil Spire]]
* The [[Goodbarrel Secret Codes]]
* [[Cloud's Lament]]
* The [[Starving Stars]] - and "see if they're looking for 3398"
	* joke, but still something they'd understand
* Whole bunch of [[The Guardians]] uniforms are involved?
* Letters from [[Winifey]] to give to [[Ellinev Del]]
	* we found them at a dead drop in [[Sciorca's Clutch]] tailing a red and orange aarakocra we think is involved in the [[Fire Raisers]]. 
* [[Terrav]] slipped us a note that said "Re-established trust in operation, many disappeared [[Zephyra]] included - she's fine, it was a plot. I'm closer to leadership now, will update soon"
* Seems the [[Fire Raisers]] have axed 20% of their operatives, some dead, some imprisioned, a few seem to have fled - the party line is that they were the cause of any violence
	* Do some folks like [[Niko]] and [[Winifey]] believe this? Or are they giving [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] lies so that they can still use us? 
* Attend the [[Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser]] for [[The Guardians]] let in [[Fire Raisers]]
	* They want to take a few items and over hear a few conversations - planning a similar style sting to [[Norathar Pent]] and [[Vigo Underswell]]?


### What We Owe and What We Need
* [[Ellinev Del]]
	* Report our work, with most details, on our efforts to stop the attack
		* Tell the people meeting with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]:  [[Del Scrucks]], [[Tevkosh Adelka]], and [[Gheston Oppe]].
		* Attend the [[Ichlior]] and [[Guruden Estate]] fundraiser, let in [[Fire Raisers]]
		* Are we still attending the [[The Providers]] party leading up to the [[Arkhosian Elections]]?
		* there ideally will be no creatures of fire at [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]].
		* They've hired illusionists in addition to the bombs
		* Seems the [[Fire Raisers]] have axed 20% of their operatives, some dead, some imprisioned, a few seem to have fled - the party line is that they were the cause of any violence
			* Do some folks like [[Niko]] and [[Winifey]] believe this? Or are they giving [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] lies so that they can still use us?
