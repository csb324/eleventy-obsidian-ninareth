Famous vocalist, the [[Bellisime]] only performs every 3 years. This year she is playing the entire [[The Pirate Queen]]. No one's ever played the entire venue before.

Funds go to the Bellisme Foundation and pay for her upkeep. 

## Who's Involved
[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is the primary sponsor of her show -- as is [[The Unforged Few]], on his behalf.

## Vask's Crew:
[[Vask]], [[Victoria Several]], [[Magister]], [[Pik]], and [[Pak]] are attending. [[Victoria Several]] wants to do business there. They all met [[The Unforged Few]] at the [[The Miscasts]] after show.

[[The Miscasts]] are playing an after show with the help of an audition secured by [[Jenson Davour]]

## Jalantar Elite:
[[Akros]], [[Victor]], [[Ellinev Del]], [[Ricci Scrucks]], [[Relakas]]

[[The Slavaadi College]] delegation:
[[Rhend Triverswill]],  [[Neiragneg|Neir]], [[Amorian]], and [[Minoa]] 

[[Fire Raisers]]:
[[Winifey]]

[[Zalevi Military]] leaders:
[[El'Haliand]], [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]], and an [[Eberronian Military]] officer Rhicka Surtev

## Schedule
6:00 - Dinner and receptions for about 3 hours
9:00 - [[Bellisime]] performs
10:00 - various theatres hosts aftershows
* [[The Miscasts]] in the Western Crows Nest
11:30 - an afterparty in Lillith hall where everyone goes to end out the night

Our party should circulate, then be at the Slater-Runehorn box (the Circler's Lounge on the 8th floor) 30 minutes before the show, then meet up with Vask and crew after at the Miscasts performance

## Notes 
[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] found out sponsoring her show has two levels:
-   Friend of Redscale - 2500 gp, on a list displayed at the event
-   Devotee of Redscale - 5000 gp, on a list displayed at the event, also a plaque

[[Costi]] was asked by the [[Fire Raisers]] to help out with something, and [[Hugh]] caught him.

The [[Fire Raisers]] staged an elaborate scene to share the [[From the Ashes Flyer]], that turned into a violent attack. 

## Consequences
Killed in the attack:
	[[Rhicka Surtev]] 
	the Ncleans who are art collectors from [[Taleem]]
	a priest of [[Bahamat]] from [[Tinkate]]
	Rike's Rats 
	Delegate Asverin Opa of the [[The Providers]]  
	Delegate Jaque Cloveniver of the [[The Guardians]]

The guard who held the hallway that [[Magister]] blocked off is named Freese, and he's getting a well earned promotion. 

The [[the Mayor of Jalantar]] is hosting an event to thank those that fought, including the [[The Unforged Few]] and the [[The Silver Halves]]. [[Captain Fretze]] and [[Victor]] held a door and are also being recognized.
