# Our invisible friend

## Phase 1: Who is our invisible friend?

Someone who is invisible that is following us? We have seen them twice, once when we covered them in flour and they eeped at a [[Samuel]] attack, and another time when they noticed we made them and left.

When [[Jade]] used her glasses on them, they were tied to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. She later asked [[The Curator]] about this, and [[The Curator]] said they were an older elven man, who wasn't *special* in the way [[The Curator]] looks out for special people, but they had a "spicy interior". Knowing that he was an elf made the party suspicious that it might be [[Branton Spout|Adrienne's dad]] - that's a male elf who's associated with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]!

We lured our pursuer to the [[Temple of the Setting Sun]], where, within the [[Shrine to Corellon]] [[Rez]] bumped his shoulder. She messaged him to say "we miss her too," and he finally agreed to speak to us - but only somewhere private, since he's being followed.

His name is [[Willow]]!!

## Phase 2: Is this guy for real?

[[Hugh]] believes [[Willow]] is crazy. This is valid: [[Willow]] is definitely crazy. The question is really, is he crazy *because of* prophetic visions, or is he *just* crazy and *believes* he's having prophetic visions. He definitely believes it with his whole heart.

He described being watched by three figures (and their agents). A fourteen foot guy in the sky who has horns ([[Costi]] said it sounded like a pit fiend), a dark-skinned human-looking man with feathery wings, who watches from ground-level, and an undead looking creature with very little flesh and sunken eyes who watches from below. So, that's spooky.
