# Arkhosian Election Day Attack
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ended</span></span>

After [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]], 95% of the [[Fire Raisers]] were in the prison beneath [[Suncrest Palace]]. It turns out, this was not the safest place they could be. [[Relakas]] and others let them out, where they split up.

Three groups went on assassination missions, leaving [[Ricci Scrucks]], [[Ellinev Del]], and [[First Officer Ghent]] dead and [[Victor]] badly wounded. 

One group was sent to prevent the Arkhosian government from pulling in reinforcements (we've been calling this the "gentle boys team"). They weren't given the full information. [[Niko]] was on this team.
One group was sent to the roof of the [[Suncrest Palace]] (and it seemed that [[Srictha]] stopped them? I don't know, clara blacked out, it was an extremely stressful ten minutes)
One group was sent to the catacombs of the [[Suncrest Palace]].
One group was sent to the [[Flyway Central Station]]. 

[[The Unforged Few]] found [[Ellinev Del]] dead, and immediately spoke to [[Victor]], who told us... a lot of stuff. Then we got in touch with [[Niko]], and were able to convince him not to launch the arrow that would have ignited bombs at the [[Flyway Central Station]]. Just in time for us all to see [[Giary]] (with support from [[Terrav]] and [[Zephyra]]) leap from the train, yeet the bomb, and crash into the rocks below. He was fine. Niko was appropriately shaken.

Then we went to the basement, to pursue [[Cinder]], [[Willum]], and [[Winifey|Winnie]]. We met [[Winifey|Winnie]] first, as she was cutting [[Srictha]]'s throat. We attacked, and defeated her and her squad of fire raisers. As [[Freya]] killed her, she whispered "It's an honor, Synchrana," which is *weird*. But we didn't have time to dwell on that, so, we kept going into the catacombs. 

We got to the Catacombs just in time to see [[Cinder]] take out a long silvery stick, like a knitting needle, and use it to smash the [[Ring of Efreet Summoning]] (the one that we stole from [[Norathar Pent]], way back when). That burst of energy opened some sort of [[There's Plainly Something Wrong with the Planes|rift]] to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] or something, and turned [[Cinder]] into... something else. It also lit four fuses. 


So, we fought [[Cinder]] and [[Willum]]. [[Willum]] pulled his walk-through-fire trick and got away, but we defeated [[Cinder]] (although his body and his sword vanished, so, we can't be sure we've seen the last of him). 

Once *that* nightmare was dealt with, we still needed to cut the fuses. We had applied [[Oil of Sharpness]] to [[Freya]] and [[Costi]]'s weapons, so they went for two of the fuses, while [[Rez]] used her buckle-creation trick on the other two. 

We got it just in time. As [[Costi]] cut the final fuse, his eyes rolled back and he had a [[Costi's Vision|vision of Samuel]]. He also fell 120 feet, so, that's fun.

Finally... quiet. We got some guards to secure the catacombs, because we haven't figured out how to close the rift, and "snakes" keep coming out of it ("eh, this is fire, they are only pretending to be snakes" - [[Jade]])

Also: At [[Cinder]] and [[Willum]]'s feet, there were three boxes enchanted with teleportation magic. The boxes were empty by the time we got to them, but it seemed that they each sent some item to a different location. The item left behind some red and gray [[stone residue]]. At some point early in the fight, [[Willum]] looked inside the boxes and smiled, so, that's probably a bad sign.

## Outcome
[[Ricci Scrucks]] - dead
[[Ellinev Del]] - dead
[[First Officer Ghent]] - dead
[[Cinder]] - dead, probably?
[[Willum]] - location unknown.
[[Winifey|Winnie]] - dead
[[Niko]] - Left the Fire Raisers, is doing his hunting *alone*
[[Giary]], [[Terrav]], and [[Zephyra]] - Pursuing [[Niko]]
[[Uru]] - Presumably, with Niko
