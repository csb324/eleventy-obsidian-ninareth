# Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ended</span></span>

A big political fundraiser for [[The Guardians]] co-hosted by [[Ichlior]] and the Guruden family, [[Quillette Guruden]] and [[Willen Guruden]]. Raising funds for [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]] and elections for [[The Circle]]. 

### Goals
* [[Jade]] watch [[Gaundon Skullmall]] eat white cheese with his right hand through her glasses ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]?)
* Open a window for [[Niko]] and [[Cut]] to sneak in
	* We need to be told which window and at what time
* Tail and eavesdrop on [[Niko]] and [[Cut]] to find out what the [[Fire Raisers]] are up to
* Meet up with [[Pruvki Forgaveat]] 
* Get important information there, potentially schematics or undergound tunnels
* Get information from [[Niko]] (or kidnap him so he can't do bad things?) We think [[Giary]] might be the right option here
	* [[Giary]] can be polymorphed into something that doens't have to breath much and put him in [[my hole]]. 
	* He'll try to convince [[Niko]], if that doesn't work, then we try to kidnap him, if that doesn't work, we have to move forward with our big plan. 
* Watch for what [[Niko]] does re: [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], since we asked him to help sabatoge and he said he'd do here
	* should we wait for our confrontation until afterwards? 
		* Pro: time to fuck up bad people, get their info so we can get that info
		* Cons: what if they sneak out and we lose the opportunity
