# Ideas for Delegates Day

### Action Items
* Stop the [[Cloud's Lament]] from reaching the city?
	* intercept the packages or destroy them
	* find out what specifically is being brought
* Organize a reason for all of the troops to be centrally located at the [[The Furnance in Arkoshia City]]? plan a single sting while they're all there 
	* pros: fewer get away
	* con: deadlier
* Split up and stop the attacks where they're planned
	* pros: easier to follow the plan they already have in place
	* con: folks might run, if we get the locations wrong we're screwed
* Stop the [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]] parade? Or diminsh parade route? 
	* increase guard presence regardless
	* pros: can't blow up what's not there
	* cons: tip off could cause the [[Fire Raisers]] to change to something we don't know about
* Locate object to find the bombs (or the fuses?)
	* disable somehow? (song of creation can create a break, on one for one hour)
* Doesn't seem like toppling leadership would be enough - is our goal to lock up everyone? 
* Do we turn in [[Rhend Triverswill]]? 
	* [[Neiragneg|Neir]] isn't sure if he should be turned in, thinks he's being mislead 
	* [[Rez]] would struggle to get her appointment (but is he really going to do it anyway?)
	* He's big fan of [[Mulfara]] independence 
* Day after tomorrow, 6 AM, [[Museum of Arkhosian History]]. We start there - from [[Srictha]]


### How to find info:
* gotta tail or eavesdrop the folks at the [[Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser]]
	* [[Rez]] or [[Costi]]/[[Samuel]] go invisible? 
* [[First Officer Ghent]] intel?
	* need [[my hole]] to potentially smuggle out 
	* ask for mounts on day of to get between bombing sites?
* [[Terrav]] update with plan the night before the attack
	* save a sending / circlet for game time calls
	* learn the location of the [[The Furnance in Arkoshia City]]
	* Specific street locations of the bombings
* Check for a message today from [[Flyte]]
* [[Pruvki Forgaveat]] conversation at the [[Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser]]
* Spy on the [[Sill Dockhouse]]? 
* [[Hugh]] use a divination 
* Meet up with [[Rhene Blackstone]]

### Timelines:
* [[First Officer Ghent]] report in 50 hours before [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]]
	* look out for clothing that have a small red dot on the inside of his shirt collar, such as by the collarbone. It's a [[Fire Raisers]] indicator 
* [[Terrav]] morning of [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]]? (need to confirm timing)
* Meet [[Willen Guruden]] 2 hours before the [[Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser]]

### The Fire Raiser Plan (as we know it)
* There's going to be 4 attacks in [[Oceantouched]], [[Quay Elliptical]], [[Pourfoot PIer]], [[The Claw]] along the parade route escourting the delegates to the [[Suncrest Palace]]. They may be simultaneous, to kill as much of the governing body as possible. Attempting to do it in isolated areas, but they expect some casualties
	* The [[Niko]] bomb site will be in the [[Oceantouched]] with the [[Fire Raisers]] dissidents. So [[Srictha]], [[Varras]], [[Zephyra]], and [[Terrav]] will join to handle this site.
	* The [[Cut]] bomb site will be [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is in the center of [[The Claw]], and gives us the address.
	* The [[Cinder]] bomb site is in [[Pourfoot PIer]] in the northern portion close to where it connects 
	* The [[Willum]]s bomb site is in the [[Quay Elliptical]] along the parade route
* [[Willum]] says the plan cannot commence without the materials on the [[Cloud's Lament]]
* He thinks the explosion is about 60ft in size, and the bomb is hidden but [[Cut]] should tell us where it is. 
* The leading party will lead the parade, other individuals are in the middle, and they're tailed by opposition. The time is based on the walking pattern, aiming for about 10:15 to hit [[The Guardians]] in the [[Oceantouched]], friends of [[Arkhosia]] in the [[Quay Elliptical]], and [[The Providers]] problems in the [[Pourfoot PIer]].
