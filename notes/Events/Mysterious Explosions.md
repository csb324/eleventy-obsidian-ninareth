#  Mysterious Explosions
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

Buildings are exploding all over [[Jalantar]]. Mostly, empty buildings. Chances are, the [[Fire Raisers]] are involved -- [[Cinder]] seemed to know about it. 

We used this as a cover for the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]. Though with every new explosion, the people looking into it ([[Ellinev Del]] [[Vigo Underswell]] etc) are seeing a pattern that our attack doesn't fit. 

Hint: It's all at either [[The Guardians]] or [[The Providers]] spaces

[Ghez Yhutl] says many happened today, at least 5. One at [[Gorva's Observatory]], the mayor's house, and on [[Redscale]] campus. 

### Examples
1st - The Dishta Chateau, a [[The Guardians]] gathering place  
2nd - [[The Providers]] Field Office in Southern [[The Publics]] (happened around the same time as the 3rd)  
3rd - [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar]] (thanks to [[The Unforged Few]]) 
4th - Personal Residence of [[The Guardians]] Delegate Faharice Mustaphel
5th - [[Gorva's Observatory]]
6th - [[the Mayor of Jalantar]] house
7th - [[Pent Logging|Pent Logging South]]
8th - the [[Overseer's Manor]]
9th - the [[Central Administrative Cluster]]
10th - the personal home of a [[The Providers]] delegate [[Kirstic Vene]]
11th - [[Norris' Bed and Breakfast]] in the [[Northern Wing]]
12th - the [[southern publics administrative cluster]] where [[Vigo Underswell]] works
13th - personal home of [[Threthdia Scrivi]] [[The Guardians]] delegate and Secretary for Arts and Culture
14th - the [[Guspen Resort]]
