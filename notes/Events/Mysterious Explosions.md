#  Mysterious Explosions
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Status</span><span class="inline-field-value">Ongoing</span></span>

Buildings are exploding all over [[Jalantar]]. Mostly, empty buildings. Chances are, the [[Fire Raisers]] are involved -- [[Cinder]] seemed to know about it. 

We used this as a cover for the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]. Though with every new explosion, the people looking into it ([[Ellinev Del]] [[Vigo Underswell]] etc) are seeing a pattern that our attack doesn't fit. 

Hint: It's all at either [[The Guardians]] or [[The Providers]] spaces

### Examples
1st - The Dishta Chateau, a [[The Guardians]] gathering place  
2nd - [[The Providers]] Field Office in Southern [[The Publics]] (happened around the same time as the 3rd)  
3rd - [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar]] (thanks to [[Our Party]]) 
4th - Personal Residence of [[The Guardians]] Delegate Faharice Mustaphel
