[Owned by::[[Zalvaris|Zalv]]
[Carried by::[[Freya]] - temporary

Sali (The Salimandar) - This longsword is forged from a blend of adamantium and ice from a glacier that once housed a powerful devil. It is a +2 weapon, and add 2d8 ice damage when you hit a creature with it. Additionally, once per day you can blast hellish ice from the weapon. All creatures in a 40 foot cube must make a DC 18 Con save or suffer 6d8 cold damage, and on their next turn they can either move, take an action, or take a bonus action. On a save, they take half damage.
