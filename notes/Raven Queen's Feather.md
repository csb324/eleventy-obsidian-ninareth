# Raven Queen's Favor

This huge, black ravenâ€™s favor bleeds divinity. As Costi holds it in his hand it tingles with a cool warmth, and fills his body with strength. As an action, Costi can activate the powerful divine presence within the feather, destroying it. In that moment, he can exert a massive amount of energy, allowing the Raven Queen to briefly enact her will on the Material Plane.

used to do a thing the raven queen would want done, in the way she wants to do it, but that's it. It's to really really fuck undead.
