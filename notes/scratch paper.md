Niko : mr business 

I talked to freya! She told me about the wedding and that the topic of whether she did anything wrong was hotly debated. Circles symbol was on a letter. What was in the letter? She won't say. Love that for her. 

Toasty costi got baby-carried into the main room 

Zalevi soldiers fight best on horseback 

"hugh... why did you pick me up and bring me into the party while I'm sleeping?"




[[Korvae]] died :(

Hugh: shinyman (according to zalevi soldier)

[[Fendrian]] the fiddler also died 

[[Eros]] also died :(  

Hugh is having a rough one 

Zalevi soldiers leave 
(Two might be siblings or twins or something - slender women with bows across their back, one is Doha who can draw and drew toasty costi for Rez)
