Upon close inspection, this bone white ring is formed of hundreds of teeth fused together, each part of a zombie clot. 

While attuned to it, it's wearer is immune to poison, necrotic, and acid damage. They can also use their bonus action to command the clot it is tied to, making it move and attack. 

If killed, this ring's clot will regenerate after 90 days unless the ring is destroyed by daily casting of greater restoration for one week. You may use your bonus action to draw life from this ring's clot by touching it. Take up to 40hp. 

### Curse
Who knows? Can't be good
