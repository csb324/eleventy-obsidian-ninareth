# Freya's Mysterious Letter
A letter [[Freya]] found in her jail cell, wedged under her door, the morning she was exiled from [[Polaris]]. We don't know who it's from.

### Text 

[[Freya]] … 
I promise, what’s coming next is a gift
Trust no one. 
Not [[Morren]].
Not [[Jorona]].
Not [[Balsandor]].
NOT [[Ronan]]. 
THEY ARE EVER WATCHING
KEEP. THIS. TO. YOUR SELF. 
Find me. 

It has drawn symbols of both the [[Wayfinders]] and the [[Freya's Mysterious Letter|Eye of the Everpresent]].

### Clues

"Hi [[Rawley]], uhm crazy question. Did you send me letter? When I left [[Polaris]]. It had [[Wayfinders]] symbol so I assumed you, is it?", he responds, "No, [[Freya]]. I didn't send you a letter before I picked you up. Make sure you bring that with you when I see you next"

We talk through [[Freya]]'s history, since it seems like there's someone else who wanted her to find the [[Wayfinders]]. She shows us the [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]] she got, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] divines the letter but doesn't pick up anything.

She asks them about [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]] she received, and [[The Curator]] says "at this point I know everything you know" - as though she'd experienced it, by helping [[Freya]] come back. She doesn't know *who* gave her the letter, but if [[Freya]] does this task they believe they have someone who can help them get to the bottom of this. 

[[The Curator]] promises answers on [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]] to [[Freya]], and asks for another week to confirm real information on who sent it rather than a guess. 

[[The Curator]] says it seems as though not everyone in [[Polaris]] cannot be trusted - [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]] was given to her by one of the [[Keepers]]. [[Freya]] is very confused. Why would they put the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]? Maybe it's because they wanted her to be warned. [[The Curator]] can only confirm that [[Freya]] has a friend in the [[Keepers]]. These things take time, but they warned [[Polaris]] is not a safe place for her. [[Freya]] says the only one who could make sense is [[Dahana]], who helped raise her.
