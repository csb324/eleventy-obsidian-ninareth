Not a lich, but wannabe's

Three of note regarding [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]] and [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]:

"[[G'zraad]] - Your progress—finally—is encouraging. Our window appears to be Riventi, do not fail to take advantage of [[Weirefesteria]]’s latent power again. We are most vulnerable in Marcanti; expect a concerted effort to undo your work then. [[Mhrhaal]]’s efforts appear to be moving apace, and mine, as you are well aware, have been established for the last year. Our southern friend and their long-shot attempt has been, unfortunately, unmade. To assist you in your efforts, we have provided one of [[Bhuldikat]]’s spawn; keep it alive. It also bears another gift, it should jumpstart your stalled workings. Do not fail this time, [[G'zraad]]. - [[Sezathkathon]]"
