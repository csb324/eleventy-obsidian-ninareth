[[Magister]] tells us thanks for the tips on the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]], that it was fascinating and he has some theroies, but he doesn't want to share until he knows more. [[Jade]] gives a compelling monologue ending in "no there are no bones here", and [[Magister]] agrees. He believes it was a temple of [[Morthos]]. A few centuries ago, there was an organization by the name of [[The Silver Hand]], remnants still exist today in some cities, that are largely cut off from the principal body that use to exist. A front group. One of the founders, a woman named [[Opal (silver hand)]] (a talented warrior and scholar), were some of the first creators of dunamancy. Details are scarce, but a key player, only known by [[Morthos|M]], or [[Morthos]], believed to be a high-elf and one of the few survivors of [[Gu’athrithen]] was rumored to be trying to unseat [[Vecna]] as the god of death. It appears he failed, at least [[Vecna]] still exists. [[Magister]] thinks that area could be slightly older than it appears, due to the infestation of undeath. It seems like people could be experimenting in dunamancy in new and exciting ways, and [[Magister]] wants to learn more. He asks us to keep an eye out for information on dunamancy, [[Vecna]], [[Morthos]], or high-elevan. And [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] about blood magic. 

[[Costi]] finds [[The Gem of TIme]] by [[Opal (silver hand)]]. [[Costi]] learns [[Opal (silver hand)]] was an extremely adept manipulator who was responsible for much of what the [[The Silver Hand]] did, and lead from the [[Right Hand]]. She also had ties to a number of other secret societies, that we know very little about. Many scholars are critical of the [[Intrepid Zumbini]] for killing her, as a lead to these secret societies. She is seen as one of the most impactful people from the [[The Second Sundering]]. Skimming it, he runs into the name [[Morthos]], and learns that she was one of the first practitioners of dunamancy. It was written about 100 years ago, around 250 years after her death. 

[[Costi]] works on the necromancy books he picked up, as well as the book on [[Opal (silver hand)]]. She was born in [[Taleem]], not much is known before adulthood, she was known to have exceptional aptitude for getting out of places naturally, and to traverse the planes like blink. She has no recorded of admittance to the [[The Slavaadi College]] but had many connections there and seemed to have spent time and learned. Fought in military conflicts as a mercenary for several groups, collecting a small following, then went off the map for 15 years. Her last expedition was in [[Turian Waste]] near [[Gu’athrithen]]. Nothing else was heard until her corpse was found. Shortly after it was found, it was vanished and has not been seen. It's believed she helped create [[The Silver Hand]] and their funds were used to finance her research in [[dunamancy]]. Many of her writings reference [[Morthos|M]].
