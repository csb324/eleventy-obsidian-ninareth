107
- Finn and Marigold talk, and after Finn cries about it, Marigold calls Teld a cunt
- Samuel tries to count the tents and counts between 15 and 60 tents with between 5 and 50 people in each. Bad job.
- Party talks. We don't:
	- Want to be enemies of the state
	- Be stuck in a position where the only logical thing to do as loyal Eborronians is attack ELA people. Make sure to keep them posted on our position in the caravan
- We're going to leave. People are being dicks to Costi and Finn. Costi doesn't notice.
- Enter Teld's tent (symbol of minotaur with a broken horn). Go to the battle map area. Around the table
	- [[Dradleston]] (old halfing) in his 70s - Thelran Asari Military
	- Green and Yellow female Tiefling [[Fingers]], black eyes, large horns, slicks her hair back and pours water on steak
	- [[Ghul]] - human woman -- sitting beside Teld in robes. Some weapon on back (obscured). Looks younger, only a little older than Trisha.
	- 9 Tails - On other side of Teld in rag-tag leathers, a goblin (attache). Looks very out of place. Carrying only a 9-tailed whip as a weapon, almost as big as the goblin.
	- [[Teld]] shocking large (8'6"), at the center of the map. Looks older, going grey. Wearing very well-cared for and very functional armor. Massive tower shield as tall as him. Axe about as tall as him to his right which he uses to stand. Axe looks to be made of bones with red lines. It definitely radiates evil. Probably not Bane because bones. Left hand is mangled, shattered with broken fingers.
- Finn talks back to Teld who calls him SVN. Finn refuses to give in. Ghul seems to take notes on it.
- Teld gives a brief
	- 3 camps located within 3 days of the compound. Some nefarious intent towards compound. Expect an attack on compound within weeks or months. Goal is to root them out and bring back a few hostages.
	- Woman in robes refers to Teld by first name in a playful way.
	- >800 soldiers drawn from "trusted" units
	- Teld nods at grizzled halfling, [[Dispek Dradleston]], saying the strategy comes from Dradleston. Dispek is not from Eberron.
		- Use small cells, largely within sight of each other, "comb through hair"
	- Bring back 90% heads 10% captives
	- We'll  be under Sgt [[Colvia Ghul]] - human in robes. We'll be with 5 other of Ghul's "trusted devotees," making up a tine.
	- No idea what the camps look like, effectively evaded gamesmen
	- ELA normally operates in the mountains, this is the closest to the center of the state they've been seen.
	- Tiefling (Sgt. [[Fingers]]) always looks at Costi when Deal 'Ras is mentioned. Teld seems to be exasperated talking about her. [[Fingers]] gesticulates a lot. She might be making fun of Teld.
	- Only goal is to get the information needed to develop a plan of attack.
	- [[9 Tails]] is Teld's attache
	- We have access to every document rated sensitivity "Silver" and below
	- Attack plan and suspected locations, ~20 groups of 10 each
		- [[Gastrada]] - Center - Ruined town of destroyed in second sundering - Teld
		- Ravines - East - Ghul (us)
		- Marshes - West - Fingers
		- Dardleston's group interspersed, cross team coordination
	- Execution of the plan could take weeks or months
	- Reading the relationships
		- Teld and Ghul find Fingers annoying but seem not to have real animus
		- Dradleston seems to actually dislike Fingers
	- Freya offers Teld some lendith. Teld pours it out. Reactions
		- Fingers and Ninetails thought it was funny
		- Dradleston thought it was needlessly mean
		- Ghul couldn't be read
- We get dismissed and head towards Ghuls banner (three strips of fabric)
- We see people a bunch of people who are whipped by Teld for tardiness. They get 2 whips, a 3rd if they cry out. The last person to show up in each group gets whipped.
- A devotee is whipped and has a symbol of Ioun. Teld shows no joy though looks at Finn as he whips the devotee.
- We start marching. Ghul is always "like a magnet" next to Teld, so we're towards the front
- Costi is a master of reading and walking. Double nat 20 on walking and reading. 150 years old, "the last Eberronian vampire was killed 2000 years ago". Propaganda about there being no vampires in Eberron but also has real information about Vampires. Costi knows some things 'bout vampires and also that this book is propaganda BS.
- Finn notices that the seventh battalion is oddly diverse, many "monstrous" races. Finn notices also that some of those folks seem more dour than others. Are they being "forced" to serve? They're not being ostracized, but it's weird.
- Finn shows off his beating hearts mark
- Ghul comes over and has Bouzad "quiet us down" (pass without a trace?).
- The devotees (all Ioun followers):
	- [[Bouzad Rukhol]] - Ranger - The 2nd least chatty
	- [[Ignatz]] - Heavy armor - The least chatty
	- [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] - Woman, friendly, got whipped, lots of weapons
	- [[Bez]] - Half-orc man, friendly, capable of healing, healed Jamzik, can cast Greater Restoration
	- [[Grizaf]] - Male Gnome, friendly, tinkers, likely an Artificer, excited to talk about his work, can cast Greater Restoration
- Ghul talks to each of us about our skills.
	- Rez tells her that she "tickles"
	- Cost is versatile but doesn't like to be punched
	- Freya is a tracker and physical, revealed that she has died. Freya finds out that Ghul has done her research (knew about Polaris).
	- Finn its combative and says it is his job to heal. He is not forthright in his abilities.
- Rez does an "is she buying our shit?" roll. She doesn't roll well.
- We all chant "USA" since our prison system isn't quite as bad as the gulags.
- Ghul probably saw Finn cast sending twice
- We start spreading out more to cover more ground. We're not very quiet
# 108
- A giant a few months ago had a weird augmentation. It looked different from this one but...?
- Adrienne shows up with Bez.
- Used diamonds to fix bodies
- Hole looks manmade
- Ghul takes Adrienne aside and asks about abilities
	- Adrienne gives "I'm a paladin" speech
		- Doesn't mention Bard stuff
		- Likely to be in front of a fight
	- Ghul tells Adrienne about ELA "burning villages, destroying roads, attacking necromancers"
	- Adrienne asks about the Ioune thing, religion in general. Ghul suggests being careful of how the religion is shown and also to make oneself valuable
## Into The Hole
- TIGHT hole with LOOSE gravel
- Jamzik is good at finding traps but missed the first trap
- We're loud. We hear jibberring voices at a fork in the road
- They're making ooze-covered weapons
- 10 Ko-tuah, led by a Yuanti, tied up a fish after the fight
# 109
- At first glace, appears as though the there is only one way in or out
- Jamsik has a way to say that she has something to share and they reach out to her. We don't know how it works. She's snarky about us not telling her things
- Adrienne and Jamsik go to interrogate the fish while Finn & Adrienne argue that torture is not useful
- Rez does a good job figuring out the cave-in
- Costi looks around with Ghostly Gaze
	- Wall-safe-like thing containing rolled bits of paper
	- Tunnel below the ooze
	- Illusionary wall that covers a peep-hole-like thing with a chamber and stool. Strange markings on the wall, maybe notation or maybe a language I don't know
- Finn investigates the area. Finds:
	- Piping connected to an ooze. They use the tubes to coat weapons. Some sort of washer-shaped gems connecting the tubes that allow the tubes to note be damaged by the ooze.
	- 6 vials of ooze
	- 20 ooze-tipped crossbow bolts
- Found letters seeming coming from, likely, the first division, Lt Eirikson
	- Adrienne heard Julien mention the Lt, happy to receive "no RSVP"
- Traveling through natural caves, lots of forks, found path that seemed most recently traveled. Leaving discrete marks to trace the way back. Lots of traps, some pretty involved and others more like run-of-the-mill bandit traps. Some are familiar to Jamsik.
- We find our way to the surface. Rez makes a lot of noise.
- Find an abandoned campsite, 5 tents.
	- Seemingly not military (tents or order/style of tents)
	- Hallucinatory orb in the fire
- Costi tries to create fake evidence, but he's not the sneakiest about it.
- We go a mile away, and Samuel places the fake evidence in the fire
- Long rest.
- Trying to get in contact with the team. We're reaching out to Colvia, have not been much in touch really. Jamsik is nervous.
	- Note: There is a code they use to communicate usually
- 6 bullettes attacked the Colvia crew and killed Bez and Grizaf
- We are walking back to Colvia, and Hugh is snared. It's a military trap. Corporal Thurath escorts us back to Fingers
- In camp, we see some people in stocks. Unclear how they ended up there but they're soldiers.
- Fingers kicks everyone (except Jamsik) out when we arrive. Fingers calls Jamsik "one of them today" (them being us)
	- One person from every team not around when there was an attack goes in the stocks. Costi takes it on. Fingers taunts Costi a little with putting Vlaad in stocks. "Teld will have her entire body"
	- Fingers seems to not trust us at the onset, but she cannot come up with any holes in our story.
- Hugh and Jamsik bond over mittens and loss
- Jamsik and Adrienne chat. Adrienne does a good job talking about how we're trying to root out disloyalty. Nat 20: Seems like Jamsik wants to like us.
- Finn sends to Sonya: "Offense seems successful. 87 dead. troops reorganizing. More defensive positions with scouts. (Our general position, estimation of troops in camp with us with remaining)"
- Rez sends to Cliff
