107
- Finn and Marigold talk, and after Finn cries about it, Marigold calls Teld a cunt
- Samuel tries to count the tents and counts between 15 and 60 tents with between 5 and 50 people in each. Bad job.
- Party talks. We don't:
	- Want to be enemies of the state
	- Be stuck in a position where the only logical thing to do as loyal Eborronians is attack ELA people. Make sure to keep them posted on our position in the caravan
- We're going to leave. People are being dicks to Costi and Finn. Costi doesn't notice.
- Enter Teld's tent (symbol of minotaur with a broken horn). Go to the battle map area. Around the table
	- [[Dradleston]] (old halfing) in his 70s - Thelran Asari Military
	- Green and Yellow female Tiefling [[Fingers]], black eyes, large horns, slicks her hair back and pours water on steak
	- [[Ghul]] - human woman -- sitting beside Teld in robes. Some weapon on back (obscured). Looks younger, only a little older than Trisha.
	- 9 Tails - On other side of Teld in rag-tag leathers, a goblin (attache). Looks very out of place. Carrying only a 9-tailed whip as a weapon, almost as big as the goblin.
	- [[Teld]] shocking large (8'6"), at the center of the map. Looks older, going grey. Wearing very well-cared for and very functional armor. Massive tower shield as tall as him. Axe about as tall as him to his right which he uses to stand. Axe looks to be made of bones with red lines. It definitely radiates evil. Probably not Bane because bones. Left hand is mangled, shattered with broken fingers.
- Finn talks back to Teld who calls him SVN. Finn refuses to give in. Ghul seems to take notes on it.
- Teld gives a brief
	- 3 camps located within 3 days of the compound. Some nefarious intent towards compound. Expect an attack on compound within weeks or months. Goal is to root them out and bring back a few hostages.
	- Woman in robes refers to Teld by first name in a playful way.
	- >800 soldiers drawn from "trusted" units
	- Teld nods at grizzled halfling, [[Dispek Dradleston]], saying the strategy comes from Dradleston. Dispek is not from Eberron.
		- Use small cells, largely within sight of each other, "comb through hair"
	- Bring back 90% heads 10% captives
	- We'll  be under Sgt [[Colvia Ghul]] - human in robes. We'll be with 5 other of Ghul's "trusted devotees," making up a tine.
	- No idea what the camps look like, effectively evaded gamesmen
	- ELA normally operates in the mountains, this is the closest to the center of the state they've been seen.
	- Tiefling (Sgt. [[Fingers]]) always looks at Costi when Deal 'Ras is mentioned. Teld seems to be exasperated talking about her. [[Fingers]] gesticulates a lot. She might be making fun of Teld.
	- Only goal is to get the information needed to develop a plan of attack.
	- [[9 Tails]] is Teld's attache
	- We have access to every document rated sensitivity "Silver" and below
	- Attack plan and suspected locations, ~20 groups of 10 each
		- [[Golstrava]] - Center - Ruined town of destroyed in second sundering - Teld
		- Ravines - East - Ghul (us)
		- Marshes - West - Fingers
		- Dardleston's group interspersed, cross team coordination
	- Execution of the plan could take weeks or months
	- Reading the relationships
		- Teld and Ghul find Fingers annoying but seem not to have real animus
		- Dradleston seems to actually dislike Fingers
	- Freya offers Teld some lendith. Teld pours it out. Reactions
		- Fingers and Ninetails thought it was funny
		- Dradleston thought it was needlessly mean
		- Ghul couldn't be read
- We get dismissed and head towards Ghuls banner (three strips of fabric)
- We see people a bunch of people who are whipped by Teld for tardiness. They get 2 whips, a 3rd if they cry out. The last person to show up in each group gets whipped.
- A devotee is whipped and has a symbol of Ioun. Teld shows no joy though looks at Finn as he whips the devotee.
- We start marching. Ghul is always "like a magnet" next to Teld, so we're towards the front
- Costi is a master of reading and walking. Double nat 20 on walking and reading. 150 years old, "the last Eberronian vampire was killed 2000 years ago". Propaganda about there being no vampires in Eberron but also has real information about Vampires. Costi knows some things 'bout vampires and also that this book is propaganda BS.
- Finn notices that the seventh battalion is oddly diverse, many "monstrous" races. Finn notices also that some of those folks seem more dour than others. Are they being "forced" to serve? They're not being ostracized, but it's weird.
- Finn shows off his beating hearts mark
- Ghul comes over and has Bouzad "quiet us down" (pass without a trace?).
- The devotees (all Ioun followers):
	- [[Bouzad Rukhol]] - Ranger - The 2nd least chatty
	- [[Ignatz]] - Heavy armor - The least chatty
	- [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] - Woman, friendly, got whipped, lots of weapons
	- [[Bez]] - Half-orc man, friendly, capable of healing, healed Jamzik, can cast Greater Restoration
	- [[Grizaf]] - Male Gnome, friendly, tinkers, likely an Artificer, excited to talk about his work, can cast Greater Restoration
- Ghul talks to each of us about our skills.
	- Rez tells her that she "tickles"
	- Cost is versatile but doesn't like to be punched
	- Freya is a tracker and physical, revealed that she has died. Freya finds out that Ghul has done her research (knew about Polaris).
	- Finn its combative and says it is his job to heal. He is not forthright in his abilities.
- Rez does an "is she buying our shit?" roll. She doesn't roll well.
- We all chant "USA" since our prison system isn't quite as bad as the gulags.
- Ghul probably saw Finn cast sending twice
- We start spreading out more to cover more ground. We're not very quiet
# 108
- A giant a few months ago had a weird augmentation. It looked different from this one but...?
- Adrienne shows up with Bez.
- Used diamonds to fix bodies
- Hole looks manmade
- Ghul takes Adrienne aside and asks about abilities
	- Adrienne gives "I'm a paladin" speech
		- Doesn't mention Bard stuff
		- Likely to be in front of a fight
	- Ghul tells Adrienne about ELA "burning villages, destroying roads, attacking necromancers"
	- Adrienne asks about the Ioune thing, religion in general. Ghul suggests being careful of how the religion is shown and also to make oneself valuable
## Into The Hole
- TIGHT hole with LOOSE gravel
- Jamzik is good at finding traps but missed the first trap
- We're loud. We hear jibberring voices at a fork in the road
- They're making ooze-covered weapons
- 10 Ko-tuah, led by a Yuanti, tied up a fish after the fight
# 109
- At first glace, appears as though the there is only one way in or out
- Jamsik has a way to say that she has something to share and they reach out to her. We don't know how it works. She's snarky about us not telling her things
- Adrienne and Jamsik go to interrogate the fish while Finn & Adrienne argue that torture is not useful
- Rez does a good job figuring out the cave-in
- Costi looks around with Ghostly Gaze
	- Wall-safe-like thing containing rolled bits of paper
	- Tunnel below the ooze
	- Illusionary wall that covers a peep-hole-like thing with a chamber and stool. Strange markings on the wall, maybe notation or maybe a language I don't know
- Finn investigates the area. Finds:
	- Piping connected to an ooze. They use the tubes to coat weapons. Some sort of washer-shaped gems connecting the tubes that allow the tubes to note be damaged by the ooze.
	- 6 vials of ooze
	- 20 ooze-tipped crossbow bolts
- Found letters seeming coming from, likely, the first division, Lt Eirikson
	- Adrienne heard Julien mention the Lt, happy to receive "no RSVP"
- Traveling through natural caves, lots of forks, found path that seemed most recently traveled. Leaving discrete marks to trace the way back. Lots of traps, some pretty involved and others more like run-of-the-mill bandit traps. Some are familiar to Jamsik.
- We find our way to the surface. Rez makes a lot of noise.
- Find an abandoned campsite, 5 tents.
	- Seemingly not military (tents or order/style of tents)
	- Hallucinatory orb in the fire
- Costi tries to create fake evidence, but he's not the sneakiest about it.
- We go a mile away, and Samuel places the fake evidence in the fire
- Long rest.
- Trying to get in contact with the team. We're reaching out to Colvia, have not been much in touch really. Jamsik is nervous.
	- Note: There is a code they use to communicate usually
- 6 bullettes attacked the Colvia crew and killed Bez and Grizaf
- We are walking back to Colvia, and Hugh is snared. It's a military trap. Corporal Thurath escorts us back to Fingers
- In camp, we see some people in stocks. Unclear how they ended up there but they're soldiers.
- Fingers kicks everyone (except Jamsik) out when we arrive. Fingers calls Jamsik "one of them today" (them being us)
	- One person from every team not around when there was an attack goes in the stocks. Costi takes it on. Fingers taunts Costi a little with putting Vlaad in stocks. "Teld will have her entire body"
	- Fingers seems to not trust us at the onset, but she cannot come up with any holes in our story.
- Hugh and Jamsik bond over mittens and loss
- Jamsik and Adrienne chat. Adrienne does a good job talking about how we're trying to root out disloyalty. Nat 20: Seems like Jamsik wants to like us.
- Finn sends to Sonya: "Offense seems successful. 87 dead. troops reorganizing. More defensive positions with scouts. (Our general position, estimation of troops in camp with us with remaining)"
- Rez sends to Cliff

# 110
- People in finger's camp give Colvia's crew acknowledgement (people know who they are)
- Speak with Colvia and Fingers, don't give a recap. Seems like Adrienne lies well when she omits the tubes from the report
- We play poker with Fingers. Adrienne and Freya roll nat 20s. Costi does a bad job.
- Adrienne goes to a briefing alone
	- At first the attacks were thought to be unlucky, they have since found traps and concluded that the ELA had advanced notice.
	- Each unit conduct a full "integrity review"
	- Noted that the power of the beasts and magical artifacts found indicate a degree of "sophistication" and financing not previously recognized. 35 monstrosities. 
	- Found evidence of supply line sabotage (rust monsters in weapons caches and weavals in food stores). No longer mission ready.
	- Cadaverists have investigated the monstrosities. Adrienne sows doubt that cadaverists could have difficult time against other Eberronian cadaverists.
	- Colvia briefs on the orb
	- Fingers implies that the college might be backing the ELA
		- Teld sent instruction to Colvia via a nod in response
	- Teld to Dradleston, "TONIGHT" you are still in charge. Eek
		- Teld recommend a significant contigent go back to the Chateau to get more resources.
		- Most likely that the rebels are based out of Golstrava. Don't want to hunker down given rebels might be at an advantage. Focus on marsh and ravine to ensure not flanked. Wait for reinforcements, then make concerted strike on Golstrava
		- Recommend >20% and <50% troops to go to get reinforcements
	- New assignments
		- Fingers headed back to chateau w/ 140 troops
		- Colvia ravine
			- We're staying with her, Thurath (in Fingers group) headed with us
		- Dradleston Marsh
		- Teld taking over for Dradleston
	- Rez is dreamed by her sister..
	- 1 in 60 people look "hollowed out" -- something to do with the interrogation. Found out from Jamsik it's from detect thoughts dig deeper
	- Jamsik gives Costi some heroin to get through the day
	- New thing -- Colvia looks to have a golden wire around her neck maybe? Unclear what it is. Looks newer though since we haven't seen it before.
	- We find a burned out hut
		- Costi send an eye, Thurath can't see it
# 111
- Travel through tunnels for >1 day
	- Pretend to be captured, Freya gets the shit kicked out of her by shield dude
	- Thurath gets really beat up
- Get tied up. Devkorus Kaa comes in
	- Kills Thurath
	- Unchains Costi
	- Gives him a hug
	- Costi says anyone could be watching, so guy shoves Costi against wall and chains him up
	- He leaves
- Comes back with some people (Tyros) who casts see invisibility to see a sensor
- They lead us into town (outskirts of Gastrava)
- Meet with Willow
	- Willow is Willow
	- Talked to Nokoro (Pelor oracle)
	- Mentioned
		- Tanim (Moradin oracle)
		- Rhehned (Bahamut oracle)
	- "The watcher" - guy who got stabbed when we last saw Willow - is Solar or Planetar. Unclear who they work for.
	- Knew we were going to New Fairhaven because Willow looks at a map, sees it, and faints
	- We ask if we'll die in new Fairhaven. He doesn't respond. He says we "must go alone" to Gizrad.
	- We will "meet a friend" in New Fairhaven.
	- Adrienne asks (and Costi writes down in Sylvain)
		- "Who are you?"
		- "Who do you work for?"
		- "What is the threat to the material plane?"
		- "What are your goals?"
	- Willow warned us that he has gotten sick eating lamb every Friday
		- Lambs are associated with Pelor and Yondalla. Pelor is more "live" lamb. Prepared lamb is Yondalla.
	- There are past Blue Roses (Joe to send a message to Clara re songs about blue roses)
	- Freya asks the Curator about whether Alhoon is still in NF and whether we have time. Curator says yes
	- Costi asks Willow if he's ever met the Curator. He says no. Then his eyes turn blue, and he remembers that he actually did meet them over tea. Willow and the Curator met 56 years ago. Curator asked if Willow wanted to join her. WIillow said no.
	- Adrienne now has an "order." Adrienne is the 3rd bearer of the Yew Blade.
- We meet with [[Devkorus Kee]].
	- Kee lived in Deal Ras and worked at AVAD.
	- Kee Presumes Vlaadi is dead. Vlaadi was last seen on assignment in the Luthei Dutchy. Some reports of missives from Vlaadi, but they have been unable to contact through normal means in 6 months. Missives are presumed to be traps. Some in the ELA have corroborated Finn's feeling that it is different from sending to someone dead. *shrug*.
	- Adrienne brings up the second division, and Devkorus takes note
	- Devkorus tells us to slow them down and that we'll get more instructions later
	- Finn asks about the undead. Apparently they intercepted a shipment and used the undead before killing them
	- They don't want to retreat. Couple things in Gastrava they're not ready to leave.
	- Devkorus fights for his wife Mebian.
	- Ask about Von. Didn't get much information.
	- Marius is in Jezitin
- We "escape"
	- We think it went well
# 112
- See Chelsea's notes
# 113
Tim is on notes duty while Reze sleeps forever.

Finn's 27 on insight tells us that the chime picked up on a lie of omission with regard to Costi's comment of no other interesting discussions with the ELA. [[Colvia Ghul]] seemed either disappointed or excited? We're left to chill in the tent which has abjuration magic.

Costi, using his Ghostly Gaze, finds out we're in a pocket dimension. Tim's opinion: it's probably one of those Mordenkainen spells. Adrienne identifies the table and knows that it produces food and water for 10 people every 6 hours. Apparently it takes requests. Freya asks [[The Curator]] about whether they know about this pocket dimension; they don't know about it.

We're in the tent for 3.5 days. Communication magic doesn't work. Costi succeeds on some book checks (2.5 questions worth). Freya gets stir-crazy and draws penises on a sleeping Rez. Adrienne successfully convinces the table to give us incense instead of food because we want to cast Legend's Lore (which uses 250g of incense). We now have 250g of incense but lack the necessary ivory strips (4 worth >=50g).

Finn divines asking, "Was our story believed?" In response, he hears "chimes tinkling and then cut off." Theories:
- Tim: Colvia didn't reveal the fact that the chimes went off at the end of our session
- Clara: They didn't believe us and plan to kill us

[[Colvia Ghul]] enters, apologizes, and lets us out. The tent has moved! We're in a larger encampment. Most of the battalion appears to be here. [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], [[Fingers]], and [[9 Tails]] are all at the center of the camp standing next to [[Dispek Dradleston]] who is on a cross being whipped. [[Colvia Ghul]] joins them.

> Teld announces, "Now that we have the rest of the battalion, it is time to meet out just deserts. The lieutenant was given a task. The task was to root out terrorists seeking to destroy our country. He was given free reign to determine how this task was accomplished because of his significant experience.. his excellence in the field. The lieutenant failed. Hundreds are dead because of his mismanagement, his idiocy, and his incompetence." Fingers stomps her foot, and shields and feet from the join in time. Teld continues, "For the crime of incompetence, lieutenant, today I sentence you to death." Teld delivers a coup de grâce to Dradleston, bisecting him with the creepy bone axe.

Colvia and Fingers seem pleased. Teld tells us that we would normally receive 6 months of time in a cell at least but because of the intelligence we brought back and Colvia's recommendation, we receive lashes. Receive 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 lashes but aren't briefed on all receiving lashes, so the order is Freya, Finn, Rez, Costi, Adrienne. The whip seems to use blood magic (Teld's blood) to be able to do double damage, which he uses against Finn only. The whip can't kill you and instead causes a level of exhaustion once you get brought to 1. Freya rolls a nat 1 to not Rage. Someone (Colvia or Curator?) tries to hold person her, but Freya doesn't Finn successfully casts calm emotions to stop Freya. Teld whispers something to Colvia, and Freya and Finn see a light turn on in Dradleston's eye and his hands twitch. They destroy his soul.

We're taken to a tent. Wounds won't stop bleeding (we were told not to heal them and that the wounds wouldn't heal on their own). Colvia hesitated before she left, and Adrienne noticed that Colvia maybe wanted to say something else but held it back. We lick our wounds for 30 minutes waiting for Teld to call on us. Colvia picks us up and takes us to a small, wooden building containing the remaining leadership. Finn notices that Fingers has an additional stripe on their uniform.

Colvia debriefs us on the campaign through the ravine. Freya insights (21) and gets no "untoward vibes" from Colvia. They captured prisons but let them escape with detailed information on the camps. The prisoners were tailed and left to leave information at a dead drop and then captured again. The 8th division is leaving a trap. Two locations expected to be attacked, and we'll be in one. Fingers is now in charge of us as we're being put in the vanguard. Finn talks back to Teld and gets whipped again. 

Fingers walks us over to our campsite. On the way there, Fingers tries to give Finn advice about not getting the rest of the party killed via insubordination. Finn doesn't take the advice. The campsite looks poorly guarded; we were maybe put here to do. Adrienne tries to go to Colvia to talk about something, but Fingers warns Adrienne that Colvia's "bite is worse than her bark." Fingers reveals that Colvia is more of a consultant, not really in the 8th. ~"Don't believe that she's your friend." Adrienne wants to go anyway and brings Costi.

Adrienne tells Colvia, in broad strokes, about Willow (very zone of truthy though). Colvia says she'll keep this as between us as she can. Adrienne gets vibes that Colvia isn't a friend but maybe that her persuasion worked?

Freya talks to Finn about losing control and tries to get Finn to tell her it's OK to make a deal with [[The Curator]] to get control over her rages. Finn recommends breathing exercises seeing through the ploy. Finn says its not worth it. Freya asks Finn to kill her if he has to, "It's not killing me if I ask you." They go back and forth on Freya getting everyone killed. Finn asks unironically why Freya "always puts other people's lives above her own." Freya beseeches the rest of the party. We all agree that *if our options are somehow kill Freya or everyone dies, we kill Freya* (but obviously there almost definitely be better options).

Costi asks Finn that maybe it would be better to not do that again with Teld. Finn explains that he has felt 9 tales ~200 times, and that it's hard to control himself.

Finn and Costi go to Rez to "tend to her" since she is responding badly to the whipping. Finn sneakily (25 stealth) sends to [[Devkorus Kaa]], "Army expecting attack (left and right sides of camp). Fell for planted information. Attack will maintain cover. Drop locations compromised. 500 troops remain in camp. Advice?" Response: "Understood." What a dick (the dick being Joe).

Adrienne talks to Fingers about what the protocol is re us healing when we're attacked. We learn that we were going to be healed before we go to bed, but the conversation in the Tent changed that.

Freya tries to do tree stuff to get closer to nature and does a bad job. Where she touches the tree little dead spots appear.

We rest successfully but don't heal.

Adrienne helps around the camp and does some snooping at the same time. Adrienne finds a lot of divining and anti-divining spells (see invisibility, counterspell, nondetection, etc...). They have 100s of spell scrolls, mostly low level but a lot of cloud kill spell scrolls. Colvia has made a least a few of them, including a 6th level scroll of Chain Lightning.

Costi goes looking for interesting stuff in the dead bodies. He does a great job but finds nothing (deciding not to plant evidence). Interestingly, the diversity and volume of monsters would require a fortune to acquire.

Finn cooks poorly and freya does manual labor.

Teld comes by, inspects our wounds for a long time, and gives us the OK to heal to half.
