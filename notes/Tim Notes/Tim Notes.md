Sikskear, 25 Marcanti

The session begins with us waking up in the [[Marble Dome]] hotel in the [[Gold Circle]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] uses the circlet to send some message to [[Henrik]]. This is an interesting choice given how close to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] he is.

We then head to a potion store, [[The Apothicaria]]. Being in the [[Gold Circle]], this is an extremely reputable shop, albeit more expensive. The man behind counter is called [[Mr. Kadz]]. We sell a lot of our collected potion materials (monster parts). Their selection is quite good, but prices are a bit higher than we're used to. He is only really showing us basic potions though, nothing particularly unique. We offer to trade some potions and exchange 4 potions of dark vision for 2 potions of necrotic resistance. We also purchase two greater (450g each) and one superior healing potion (900g). If we were to spend 10,000g, we could get access to the more interesting potions. We could also commission custom potions. We do ask about commissioning anti-petrification salves (diamond goo), and he offers to look into it for 2,000g. The remnants of the goo that we have, he estimates, has ~800g worth of diamonds in it. We decide to think about the salve/goo offer.

[[Freya]] goes to the [[Quaath Wayfinder Outpost]]. She gets treated to food. They love her there.

We return to the hotel to find the [[The Silver Halves]] ([[Magister]], [[Vask]], and [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]) eating lunch. They're leaving the city early because after [[Rez]] and [[Vask]]'s sister was killed, [[Vask]] seemed to have maybe killed or maimed some people in the [[Copper Circle]]. Now their party is wanted. [[Costi]] pulls [[Magister]] aside to show him the olives that the team found in the [[Duvey Crypt]]. They seem connected to Chronomancy. [[Magister]] said not to eat any more of them. Perhaps when we visit the [[Duvey Family]] shop, we should hide anything the we took from their crypt.

[[Magister]] pulls [[Hugh]] aside and asks about plans for visiting the [[Burbank Compound]]. [[Magister]] advises caution, but [[Cliff Burbank]] might deserve "the opportunity to be trusted." He has the reputation of being unlike the other Eberronians. [[Hugh]] is wary given [[Cliff Burbank]]'s position in the army. [[Magister]] gives [[Hugh]] a blue vial. The vial provides one nights sleep (since [[Hugh]] normally cannot sleep as a Warforged). This would allow [[Magister]] to contact [[Hugh]] in his sleep. [[Magister]] keeps a few on his person that he had commissioned from an unnamed alchemist friend. He mentions that he keeps them in case he needs to separate from [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] hinting at some chink in their relationship or perhaps just [[Magister]] being extremely cautions.

[[Vask]] asks [[Rez]] how [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is fairing ([[Vask]] lightly poisoned her after [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was not particularly kind to [[Vask]] while [[Vask]] was grieving over his sister.) The alternative to the poisoning was telling [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was alive. That would have been awful. [[Vask]] tears the letter in half. [[Rez]] tells [[Vask]] to tell [[Rez]] if [[Vask]] finds a lot of diamonds. [[Vask]] warns [[Rez]] to avoid the copper since the two look so alike. [[Vask]] tells [[Rez]] that the two men he killed were bad men.

The party goes to a magic shop and purchases a scroll of Feather Fall and Absorb Elements. [[Costi]] copies absorb elements into his spell book. 

[[The Silver Halves]] skip town. The party decides to talk about plans.
* We're going to [[Eberron]] in the [[Dharinov Duchy]].
* [[Hugh]] wants to go to learn about Warforged from [[Cliff Burbank]]. [[Magister]] implied they could help unlock memories since [[Hugh]] was in [[Cliff Burbank]]'s 
* [[Costi]] wants to talk to [[Cliff Burbank]] since he was head of the [[Beating Heart Battalion]] which is the military that [[Costi's Dad]] was a part of. He also wants to go to stop by [[Deal 'Ras]] (home town) on the way back.
* [[Freya]] wants to go because [[New Fairhaven]] is connected to [[Von]] who is connected to [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]].
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] might want to get some questions about [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] answered.

For our discussion with the [[Duvey Family]], we want to fish for information on how much the family is involved with everything undead and Dunamancy related to [[Winifey]] in [[Arkhosia]].

[[Silver Scale Jazat]] greets us on our way to the [[Temple of Corellon Outside Quaath]]. [[Hugh]] splits off. [[Fig]] is surprised to find out that we were successful. She notes that [[Willow]] being in this world and actually successful is terrifying. [[Willow]] said he, "had to see a horse about a man" before leaving immediately after we left. He didn't seem like had more details to give. He said he'd see us in "34 days" from when he left (2 days after us, on the 8th of Marcanti). We give her a little information about our trip and success.

[[Hugh]] stops by the small [[Temple to Moradin outside Quaath]] and pays his respects. 

[[Silver Scale Jazat]] greets us on our way back in. He offers a guard for the trip back to the city. We warn him about there being extra excitement in the copper.

Before entering the [[Duvey Family]] shop, [[Costi]] casts Arcane Eye. We enter and provide the passphrase, "Jade earrings and a sapphire bracelet." While attempting to move the eye through the first door, the gnome that greeted us upon entry sees the eye and offers to dispel it given we're clearly being followed (he knows it's us and is giving us an out). The gnome uses a badge/key with a flower "D" on it to get an elevator of sorts. 

After descending, we notice a portrait of the family which includes a younger [[Winifey]] and another woman who might be [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]'s ex, [[Baldred Duvey]]. We are given drinks customized to us:
- Oil for [[Hugh]]
- Lindith for [[Freya]] -- this is weird since they would need to have extremely recent intel from Dilandil
- A [[Goodbarrels]] ale for [[Costi]]. It *might* be the vintage from the [[Fire Raisers]] mission (3434). Turns out it's 2140.
- An extremely fine wine for [[Rez]]

A woman about [[Rez]]'s age greets us. It's [[Baldred Duvey]]. She says outright that she knows us, and that she knows we know her. She hopes we're not too prejudiced against her. She says she was surprised she didn't see us. She knows that Adrienne is alive and gives her a vial of deep blue liquor. It is her job to know things.

She welcomes us to her office. It contains a view of the tropics in the back of the room.

There is a display case in the room:
- Single glove
- Long thin sword (rapier?)
- Porcelain hand with 2 rings on it

She offers to buy:
- Gith greatsword
- Ivory Pistol
- Ring of Telekinesis
- Cube of Force

She offers 500g for the Ivory Pistol, which is insane. In the end, we sell Gith greatsword, ivory pistol, and cube of force. In exchange we get a sweet ring. 

[[Baldred]] asks about [[Victoria]]. She is surprised to see the [[Several Family]] doing so well after the second sundering. She tells us that [[Dante Several]] was a "bad fellow... was up to no good in the great war working for that elf, [[Valcano]]." Dante sold his soul. The heroes of the age put him down. Upon this information coming out, the [[Several Family]] was ruined. They've been doing well over the last 80 years. [[Baldred Duvey|Baldred]] and [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] dating improved Several's social standing. [[Baldred Duvey|Baldred]]'s cousins do the adventuring. When we asked if they need us to get them anything, [[Baldred Duvey|Baldred]] asked for doors. Magical ones. Historical ones. Baldred would like to continue to work with us, but [[Carlot Duvey]] might decide to take on the because she still runs the shop and handles the biggest clients.

Baldred asked about her cousin. We tell her that [[Winifey]] is likely dead. She asks us to tell her if we get more definitive information.

We see two people lounging on the way out.
- [[Carlot Duvey]] - Older, extremely fit women in a fine dress. Shoulder length grey hair with some decorative braids running through it.
- [[Jendorp Duvey]]- Younger man with short dark hair, square jaw and square shoulders. Smoking a pipe.

Carlot and Jendorp approach. Jendorp calls [[Vask]] an impressive man. To Rez, "If you need anything while you're in Quaath, let me know." Carlot wishes we could have gotten to know each other more. She wants us to consider the Duvey's our stop next we're in Quaath. The gnome lets us out. Note, Baldred refers to Jendorp as Jeni, and he refers to her as Baldy.

Jendorp secretly left a note in Rez's pocket offering a drink at the hotel tonight.

Suddenly Freya feels a knife in her side. A Grung says, "Slay the grung slayer!" We fight. It's a full adventuring party called "The Grung Slayers." We win but one gets away having stolen Freya's Grung cloak. We complain and get the rest of the trip comped.

Chatting, we agree [[Rez]] should go meet [[Jendorp Duvey]] for drinks. Asks to tell [[Vask]] "He'll have his" - he should know what that means. He asks Rez what she'll drink. Rez lets him order. Jendorp asks the bartender, Kurt, for a drink that is a family recipe. Apparently Kurt is a friend of the family. Jendorp is not in town often and doesn't spend much time in the gold circle. He has a small fleet of 3 airships and 15 transport ships. He prefers the sea over the sky. Kestin does more airshiping. He and Kestin are the primary people who get items for the family. They also freelance in addition to retrieving items for the family. "I do not envy Baldred.. her time behind the desk." The drink comes, and it's a smoked drink. It must sit for 7 minutes or it is ruined. "Why have something that is not the best." Rez brings up [[Arkhosia]]. Jen asks, "is it true [[Winifey]] is dead?... No one has head of her in 4 years."  Kestin apparently also disappears, but he sends notes. Uncle [[Albus Duvey]]'s daughter. Jendorp never cared for Winifey much, "some family is dead weight." Jendorp thinks it was mutual. Jen has been trying to get the uncle cut off for 31 of his 33 years. Jen brings up the gambling, drinking, bastard children, etc... "we could just let him drown." Jen is "as close as anyone is to [[Carlot Duvey]]." "I think Carlot might be immortal." Insight yields (13):
- Arrogant
- Interested in meeting Rez, unclear *why*

The drink is delightful and from the tropics. Pineapple. Jen asks for any leads on items. Rez mentions the tapestry. Jen has heard rumors of where we're going next and mentions [[Sienna Burbank]]. Mutual family friends, Sienna might be doing supper with mother. It was a "guess" that Sienna was connected. He mentions that "the little one" (Costi) is from Eberron. Doesn't like Eberron. "That many rotting corpses.. it permeates the air." Asks why Ebberon. Rez says they're friends. "The tie is no longer with you" he says loudly, "such a shame that Adrienne passed." He's clearly trying to show that he is happy to help keep the secret. Re why he slipped a note in Rez's pocket. "If Vask's sister is anything like Vask..." Insight check (18) yields from Joe, "Vask is cool and this one's a lady." Poor Rez. Second insight w/ adv on whether there is info to be gained, he's a little insufferable being so rich but he just wanted to go on a date. No info probably from this encounter. Fade to black. BUT NOT BEFORE DRUNKENLY SHOOTING GUNS INTO THE NIGHT. He's gone when she wakes up, but leaves a note, "You were right, much the preferred sibling"

12 hour warning at 3am sent to Costi.

Hugh gets a note under his plate. He goes down into the basement. A gnome hugs him. "29? Is it really you?" "It's your Charky." Hugh doesn't remember. Charky says "I must have been mistaken" and walks off. Hugh comes back and tells the rest of the party. The party sees him and so, without Hugh (who succeeds on some saves but it's getting harder). Rez talks to him over message, and he seems ignorant of the issues with Hugh and tells us to order room service to talk to him. We start talking to him and explain who he is. They served when he was younger (~65 years ago, Charkus is ~100), knew Hugh as "29"/"SVN29"/"SVEN". Hugh always hated killing. Hugh saved Charky who disobeyed and order and was put on trial. Hugh got him out 63 years ago. Ask for some names, we get Githeros, cruel man who served the 18th battalion. Served in Dharinov, grew up in Jesitin. Surname Duvram. Hasn't spoken to them since he left and told us not to mention him being alive. Charkus asks what Hugh is like, and ends up silently trading Hugh a thimble for a stone that Charkus turns into a necklace. We cry.
