# Eberronian First Division
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Affiliation</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Eberronian Military]]</span></span>

Subset of the [[Eberronian Military]], led by [[Colonel Dardenev]]. 

### What's It to Us?
As we wait, we read all of the secret materials. The letters connect [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] to several people within the [[Eberronian First Division]] who wanted to expand their influence in the Duchy. 

[[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]], for the last 3 and a half years, was working to bring [[Viliki]] under the control of the [[Eberronian First Division]]. She had issues with the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] approach to necromancy. There's correspondence between her and several figures in the [[Eberronian First Division]]. 

[[Colonel Dardenev]] has claimed ignorance to the sedition, and is sending 6 of the conspirators to the [[Burbank Compound]]. They believe she was in control of the undead that were created, and was forging records of ownership - to try and create a coup or frame someone in [[Viliki]]. The rest of the necromancers are dead, [[Zesnel Ponner]] seemed to originally be in on it, then tortured into compliance the last few months. There's no record of [[Shay]], or [[Gregory]]. Two names are affiliated with the [[flesh stitched behemoth]],  [[Burston Courtev]], [[Jezeten]] and [[Salid]], [[New Fairhaven]], with their addresses.  

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] knows [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] knew [[Irickson]], who was happy to receive his no to an rsvp, with the sense he would be awkward with the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] and must've invite them both. 

Lieutenant [[Irickson]] commissioned a weapons factory, we found outside of the [[Burbank Compound]], and is overseeing it. The correspondence goes back about a year and a half, and in sum have created around 900 weapons. They've requested more ooze, and details the work of the tubes. In the hole there are three more of the glowy-green tubes that we found in the giant. Several have gone out from this area over their work. The various recipients are annotated by number.
