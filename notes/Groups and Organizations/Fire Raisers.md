# The Fire Raisers

A group of political dissidents in [[Arkhosia]]. [[Niko]] is involved, as is [[Srictha]]. They believe in the abolition of slavery, but that they "don’t hurt people” it’s “not their goal and not initiated by them”. 

Keep bloodshed avoided, but want to expose corruptions and let the people decide what to do. Claims they want “real change for the little people"

### Who're they to us?
[[Niko]] brought us to their HQ [[The Furnace]] and made introductions.

As a treat for saving [[Niko]] they promised some rewards to [[Our Party]]

* They'll help us make it look good when we "escape" our "hostage situation"
* They'll make sure the various governments permanently forget that [[Rez]] was ever tied to [[Niko]]
* [[Freya]] asked for a cool axe or something, and maybe a shield
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked about armor training
* [[Costi]] would like to know more spells, please (and also, of course, information about [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]])
* [[Hugh]] would like a pet. Preferably a nocturnal pet? And, again, info on [[Costi's Dad]]
* [[Rez]] wants to meet the coolest wizard they've ever met. 

Hired [[Our Party]] for [[Operation Incriminating Letters]]
