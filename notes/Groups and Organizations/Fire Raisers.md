# The Fire Raisers

A group of political dissidents in [[Arkhosia]]. [[Niko]] is involved, as is [[Srictha]]. They believe in the abolition of slavery, but that they "don’t hurt people” it’s “not their goal and not initiated by them”. 

Keep bloodshed avoided, but want to expose corruptions and let the people decide what to do. Claims they want “real change for the little people"

### Who're they to us?
[[Niko]] brought us to their HQ [[The Furnace]] and made introductions.

As a treat for saving [[Niko]] they promised some rewards to [[The Unforged Few]]

* They'll help us make it look good when we "escape" our "hostage situation"
* They'll make sure the various governments permanently forget that [[Rez]] was ever tied to [[Niko]]
* [[Freya]] asked for a cool axe or something, and maybe a shield
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked about armor training
* [[Costi]] would like to know more spells, please (and also, of course, information about [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]])
* [[Hugh]] would like a pet. Preferably a nocturnal pet? And, again, info on [[Costi's Dad]]
* [[Rez]] wants to meet the coolest wizard they've ever met. 

Hired [[The Unforged Few]] for [[Operation Incriminating Letters]] 

[[Zephyra]] joined up with the [[Fire Raisers]], said there's been a split at [[The Furnace]] of one group who wants to prioritize innocents and another select few who disagree. And they've been trying to get rid of folks who are violent, [[Winifey]] and others who were close to [[Niko]].  

Wants [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] to find the violent folks who haven't been rounded up, [[Srictha]] and [[Ulia Glorsbade]] and potentiallly [[Twigs]], to try and determine if they intentionally turned violent. [[Zephyra]] says it might be wise for them not to return. [[Cinder]] is leading this effort, though the real power is above him that are unknown, but [[Terrav]] seems sceptical. Keeps saying "that's what THEY say".

[[Terrav]] says most the people killed at the [[Bellisme Show]] were mostly not from the explosion or ash monsters, but from smoke inhalation or weapon damage. Warned us they're starting to gear up ahead of the [[Arkhosian Elections]].
