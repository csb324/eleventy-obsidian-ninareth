# The Stagehands

The criminal underground of [[Jalantar]]. We're supposed to forget this, but their secret-passcode is "We wait in the wings" (to which the other replies "We run the show").

### NPCs
{% include 'list-references.html', reference_data: affiliations %}


### Who're they to us?
Some formerly-alive members (RIP [[Lish]]) tried to jump [[The Unforged Few]] outside the [[Seven Hooves]]. [[Quarrin Witherspoon]] put a stop to it and gave us our formal introduction to the organization. Said the hit wasn't sanctioned, and that if we get in trouble to come tell him.

For fifty gold, [[Giary]] is using their networks to get info on [[Costi's Dad]].

Helped "misplace" [[Rez]]'s [[Jalantar]] visa that was sponsored by [[Niko]] through [[Giary]]

Took a contract, unknowingly from [[The Unforged Few]] through [[Giary]] (who will totally tell them eventually.. maybe) for [[Operation Incriminating Letters]].

- Information on when [[Norathar Pent]] and [[Vigo Underswell]] would be out of their respective offices
- Possibly *moving* when they would be out of their offices to a time that is more convenient for us
- Getting [[The Stagehands]] to look the other way, if something perhaps happened when those people were out of their offices
