## Shit we've got going on
- Adrienne wants to get a harp fixed, and her boss [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is going to be in [[Jalantar]] in a couple weeks. 
- We have a [[Summoning Stone]] from the [[Temple of Pelor outside Jalantar]], and we told [[Father Gryuu]] we'd bring it to a bigger temple.
- [[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] are looking for [[Costi's Dad]], or evidence that he might be alive
- [[Freya]] is keeping an eye out for a series of circles, a strange symbol she saw on a letter once.
