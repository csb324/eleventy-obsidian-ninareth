# Zalevi Military

The military of [[Zalev]]. They're particularly good on horseback.

The Zalevi Slavecatchers are a particularly well-trained, ruthless, and elite group within the forces. Right now, they're on a campaign to find [[Arazoak|Zalevi fugitives]] in foreign cities and bring them back to [[Zalev]] for execution.
