# The Burning Sons

An older human man in shining gold armor, [[Rieltar]], a orc women in similar gold armor [[Durembur]], and in the back a large human woman with a huge bow across her back, [[Skiv]]. 

We check their vibe before we head out, it's clear [[Rieltar]] is their leader from an earned respect, [[Durembur]] is very close with him, and in a romantic relationship with [[Nekto]]. [[Skiv]] is in some ways more separate from the rest of them. 

Hates [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] 

Not doing well, maybe on his own. Always not sober. In [[Thelran Asari]], [[Eirian]] knows him, mostly spends his time in [[The Barrels]].
