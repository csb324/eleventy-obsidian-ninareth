# Order of the Platinum Dragon

[[Bahamut]] is a god. These are the people involved in worshiping them. 

The Fang, Claw, and Wing are the subsects who run the Order. The head of each is one of the three heads. But then there are the Scale paths, which are more like roles within each of the three paths.

Gold, Silver, Bronze, Brass, and Copperscales. Some paths have more of one than another; Bronzescales are mostly in the Claws.

- Honor and Fealty to the Justicemaker (Bahamut);
- Honor and Respect to Righteous Innocence;
- Honor and Protection to the Lesser Races;
- Honor and Correction to the Enemies of Justice and Good;
- Honor and Forbearance for oneself.
