# the Dragon's Hide (A.K.A. Hidesman)
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Based in</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Jalantar]]</span></span> 

The elite order of guards in [[Jalantar]]. They're often involved in shady shit, including the [[Threthdia Assassination]] (as her personal guards) and the [[Fire Raiser Baddie Audit]] (members of the Dragons Hide may be pushing the [[Fire Raisers]] to become more violent).
