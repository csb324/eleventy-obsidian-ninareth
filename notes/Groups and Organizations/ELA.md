# Eberronian Liberation Association
<span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Based in</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Eberron]]</span></span> (duh)

[[Costi]]'s parents were involved in some secret political stuff (and in [[Eberron]], everything political is probably also secret). Claim to be working to bring freedom to Eberron.

The ELA is known and legal but high-visibility members tend to get arrested or killed... coincientally. So members stay hush hush. 

This organization says [[Costi's Dad]] is alive. [[Costi's mom]] is also part of this organization. Little else is known.

They have shared interests with [[The Providers]].
