# Eberronian Liberation Association

[[Costi]]'s parents were involved in some secret political stuff (and in [[Eberron]], everything political is probably also secret).

The ELA is legal but high-visibility members tend to get arrested or killed... coincientally. 

This organization says [[Costi's Dad]] is alive. [[Costi's mom]] is also part of this organization. Little else is known.

They have shared interests with [[The Providers]].
