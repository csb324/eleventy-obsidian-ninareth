# The Self Made Men
A group of awakened warforged who work for their collective rights.

Look out for each other first, and differentiate themselves from "biologics". Says their bodies don't decay and they need not be confined by the concept of age. 

### Background
Founded and funded by [[Magister]] 

### Notes
They are heading to [[Eberron]] next, and will look into [[Rhicka Surtev]] on behalf of [[Hugh]]. Will also look into the brand on his arm, and ask about [[Eberronian Military]] regalia.
