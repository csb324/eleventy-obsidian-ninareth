# The Miscasts
![](/assets/obsidian/Miscasts.jpg)

Ninarith's first boy band. Managed by the one and only [[Jenson Davour]]. 

### Members
[[Josh|Jinx]] the frontman with everything that entails
[[Jax|Curse]], the dulcimer player and the bad boy
[[Rian|Hex]], the drummer and kind of a fuckboy
[[Lorian|Bewitch]], the shy pan flute player
[[Tames|Charm]], he is a halfling and we haven't really talked to him much

### Notes
[[Bellisime]] owns the entire [[The Pirate Queen]] this year, but [[Jenson Davour]] got them auditions to be a warm up act. They were beat out for the venue they really wanted by Rike's Rats, and [[Josh|Jinx]] took it really hard -- and is scheming to take them out of business? 

[[Rez]] always makes them a [[Shot Toddy]] before every show she's at with them. It's their friendship thing.
