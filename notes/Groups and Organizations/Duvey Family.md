# Duvey Family

The [[Duvey]]'s are a competing family to [[Several's Antiquities]], and they show us their family symbol - a very flowery D. They are a merchant family, selling home goods, but leaned toward the adventuring type. 

If we want to visit their store we just need to make an appointment, they don't really have stores - you just make adjustments.

We had an adventure in the [[Locations/Arkhosia City/Duvey Crypt|Duvey Crypt]].
