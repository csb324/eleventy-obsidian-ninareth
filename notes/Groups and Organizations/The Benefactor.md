# The Benefactor

[[Rez]] and [[Vask]]'s front for their patronage

## Benefactees
- [[The Miscasts]]: up and coming boy band I became good friends with
- K: A sculptor, who primarily commissions historical busts and likes to go cryptically by “K” -- I appreciate the sense of drama
- Imoza: A weaver, elderly but truly gifted.
- Lorsai: A poet, who I incentivize to tell good stories about metallic dragons (hearts and minds!!) 
- Sir Torrin: A jeweler who is Vask’s favorite and owns a store called the Treasure Chest**
