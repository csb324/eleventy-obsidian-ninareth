# Session 35: 

[[Neiragneg|Neir]] checked in with [[Rhend Triverswill]] and gave a status report. Turns out we're making a foundation for all the NEW widows after the [[Bellisme Show]] attack.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] woke up and wanted to use her new ties to [[Corellon Larethian]] and cast Divine Sense. She got some whispers and side-eyed [[Costi]]. 

We all sat down to debrief from the attack and discuss the [[Fire Raisers]]. [[Neiragneg|Neir]] mentioned [[Rhend Triverswill]] might've helped with the attack. [[Rez]] is concerned about the [[Ring of Efreet Summoning]] we helped them get, and thinks they're messing with things too powerful for them. [[Freya]] says we have a responsibility to help our communities, but isn't sure if that means working with or against them. [[Costi]] thinks this was bad, but a mess up. And maintains we need them for information on [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] as well as to help [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] get away from [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is weighing the options, but doesn't think they have their shit together. 

[[Ricci Scrucks]] came to the [[The Golden Gryffon]] to discuss the attack. [[Costi]] came in with a detect thoughts active. Told us about 30 died people, as far as preliminary numbers say. Around 15,000 were attending the event. [[Rhicka Surtev]] died in the attack, the Ncleans who are art collectors from [[Taleem]], a priest of [[Bahamat]] from [[Tinkate]]. We learned that the guard who held the hallway that [[Magister]] blocked off is named Freese, and he's getting a well earned promotion. Rike's Rats also died in the attack. Delegates Asverin Opa of the [[The Providers]] and jaque Cloveniver of the [[The Guardians]]. [[Magister]] caused the most damage but offered to fund the neccessary renovations. 

Asked us to recap what we saw, we flagged that it got worse later in the event, that the monsters were tied to the ceiling, and that they targeted stronger people at first. 

Specifically mentioned tracking down everyone we fought with, but didn't recognize [[Winifey|Winnie]]. Asked us if we knew her or saw where she went. We said she disappeared and avoided mentioning we knew here.

[[the Mayor of Jalantar]] is hosting an event to thank those that fought, asked us to attend along with the [[The Silver Halves]]. [[Captain Fretze]] and [[Victor]] held a door and are also being recognized. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked about his opinion on the [[From the Ashes Flyer]] before the attack. He didn't say much. 

[[Rez]] and [[Costi]] went to lunch with [[Victor]], he said [[Ellinev Del]] asked him to stay in [[Jalantar]] for a few weeks to help out. We connected him with [[Neiragneg|Neir]], who we think should work with [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]. He's happy to help.

Before he left, [[Neiragneg|Neir]] enchanted [[Hugh]]'s hat into a [[Tophat of the Sharp Mind]] to help him concentrate
