# Session 42: Damien and The Saws

[[The Unforged Few]] found ourselves once again at [[The Thrusting Trumpet]]. It had been a while.

[[Tinzelven]] is uncannily quiet. A sizable portion of the already-small population has gone to [[Arkhosia (City)]] for the elections, either to accompany [[Willen Guruden]] or for their own reasons. [[Brianna]] was very happy to see customers come in.

We caught up with [[Deeksta]]. She said she hadn't heard from [[Niko]], but [[Freya]] wasn't sure that was the whole truth. She mentioned she was staying busy with training, and [[Costi]] asked for some fighting tips. So we went to the guard house and played Connect 4 with daggers.

[[Winston]] eventually also joined us at [[The Thrusting Trumpet]]. He said he wasn't a heavy drinker but for some reason, that was what the vibes called for that night, so we pushed him into it. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] collected some gossip about [[Damien]]. If there's a weird recluse who lives close to a town like this, that town is going to have some opinions. [[Winston]] and [[Brianna]] said he was a weird dude, and unrelentingly pretentious about music that no one else enjoys. Also, his house might be haunted. 

([[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Costi]], and [[Freya]] got *drunk*. [[Freya]] just started asking [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] random questions. [[Costi]] tricked [[Deeksta]] into using the [[Blow Em]] in a whistle-blowing-contest. It was lit.)

[[Rez]] and [[Deeksta]] rekindled their connection, and [[Rez]] was able to get a little more information about [[Niko]]. [[Deeksta]] said she'd seen [[Niko]] briefly, and that he seemed excited about things, but that they never really talked about politics, given her position with [[Willen Guruden]]. It turns out, she's a voter! Anyway, she said it was most likely that [[Niko]] was hiding in [[Jalantar|plain sight]]. 

 She also asks [[Rez]] to help keep [[Niko]] on the right side of things. Claims he has a good heart, but seemed excited - like things may be starting on up. She worries things are going to get much more dangerous. 

The next morning, we made our way to [[Damien]]'s haunted bachelor pad. On the way, we saw a wagon with a broken wheel. [[Hugh]] did not hesitate to offer their assistance to whoever was in the wagon. Who was in the wagon? [[Gruung]]. 

So here we are again, in [[Tinzelven]], fighting [[Gruung]]. But now we have new tricks. [[Costi]] had [[Samuel]] cast the new spell that he learned from [[Magister]], and [[Samuel]] turned purple. So, that's interesting. Unfortunately they also have new tricks, like making [[Hugh]] believe that they are his friends, or making [[Costi]] run from us in fear (although to be fair, the gruung didn't actualy do that to us -- Costi did it to himself, for science).

[[Freya]] now has enough gruung-skins to make a jacket out of them, which is what she intends to do. 

> We all discuss the good time the night before, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s clear growing affection for [[Vask]].

With the [[Gruung]] situation settled for now (if there's one thing we know about gruung, it's that there are always more gruung), we finally approached [[Damien]]'s home, surrounded by a graveyard that did not feel entirely dead. [[Damien]] came out with a crossbow leveled at us.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] told him she just wanted to talk, and explained that while they were there on [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s behalf, they were not necessarily committed to working in his interests. Finally, he allowed us to come inside, if we left our weapons at the door. 

[[Damien]] did not trust anything coming from [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], which, *fair*. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] wanted his property back *or* the flute, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] reminded [[Damien]] that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] doesn't give up easily. [[Damien]] said Julian had no right to demand anything from him, and showed [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] the records he'd kept of the payments he'd been making on the initial loan that got him into this situation, but the interest outpaced his payments. And, as [[Costi]] reminded him, [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] will twist the terms to mean whatever he wants them to mean.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] pointed out that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] didn't care about the property until [[Damien]] got this [[Magical Flute]]. So, if someone wanted to keep [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] from getting what he wants, it would make sense for that person to maybe give up the property instead of the [[Magical Flute]], right?

(By the way, [[Damien]] was not alone. He seemed to have a whole bunch of undead figures around to keep him company. He spoke to some in infernal, which [[Costi]] understood.)

[[Costi]] volunteered that he intended to kill [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] someday, and if he did, [[Damien]] could get the flute back. [[Damien]] didn't seem to think this was likely to happen, but he was very interested in whether [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was on board with the killing-Julian plan. 

Regardless, we were *really* there to talk about his *music*. So we asked to hear the *cutting-edge* stuff he'd been creating, and we managed to be sufficiently persuasive about it ([[Rez]], at least, was genuinely curious). So he played us something on an instrument of his own creation... *The Saws*. 

(See what I did there with "cutting edge"?? Thanks, I'm proud of it.)

It was rough to listen to. But [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] suggested the sound would carry beautifully across the forest, and perhaps this specific space was holding him back creatively. [[Costi]] suggested breaking the instrument apart at the end of the piece in a violent explosion. [[Damien]] liked the second idea. Whatever. 

After trying out [[Costi]]'s shattering-saws technique (and realizing the echoes *do* layer interestingly in a larger space), [[Damien]] came around to the idea that maybe we were here to help. He called to his undead buddies and told them "We're moving." To pay off the rest of his debts, some of the skeletons pooled together the jewelry they were buried with! Such sweet skeletons.

As we were leaving, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tried to get a bit more information out of [[Damien]] about how he and [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] worked together. [[Damien]] said he'd really only done one job for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], with [[Sienna Burbank]] and [[Cliff Burbank]] and [[a guy whose name was or wasnt Jimbothy]], and a [[girl who played the bagpipes]], and maybe someone else? They were all at [[Redscale]] at the same time. Damien said that [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] was always nice, and that [[Cliff Burbank|Clifford]] was a douchebag. 

As we left, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] told [[Damien]] to get in touch with [[Costi]] if he ever did want to take [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] down. Not her. She's very loyal. Obviously.
