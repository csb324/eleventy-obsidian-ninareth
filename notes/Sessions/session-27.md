# Session 27: two truths and a lie

We went to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]], ostensibly to thank [[Divitston Goldstone]] for making [[Rez]] such a nice ring, but more importantly, to procure some lead to shield the real [[Ring of Efreet Summoning|ring]] from [[Norathar Pent]].

[[Divitston Goldstone]] was a real sweetie about it. [[Costi]], ever paranoid, looked around to find goldstone's calling card - a signature detail that could be traced back to him. Turns out, he has one! A thin line where the blade meets the hilt. But it's only on weapons, so, the ring is probably not traceable that way. 

[[Rez]] asked for some softer metals, maybe, so that she could practice her metalworking without being at the forge all the time. She may have suggested that she's going to make [[Divitston Goldstone]] a thank you present. but now we have lead. 

([[Hugh]] went to the hearth to look for lead but didn't find any.)

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] saw some compelling glowing trees at [[Corellon's Grove]] and decided to stop by. She wound up in the cave she visited [[session-24|earlier]], which was empty. the acoustics were exactly as good as she hoped they'd be.

She'd also hoped she'd run into [[Dawenys]], so she left a note. And then she ran into [[Dawenys]]! They exchanged questions such as "what the fuck is going on?" and "what are you missing?" (to which the answer was most certainly NOT "people") and "what does [[Corellon Larethian]] WANT from me?" and "have you ever expressed a feeling in your life?" which is an incredibly offensive thing to ask a musician, by the way. Did anyone get forthright answers? Unclear. ([[Dawenys]] also mentioned that she shouldn't go into the caves without letting someone know. Sometimes there might be monsters or something down there)

When we all linked back up at the [[The Golden Gryffon]], we had a note waiting for us. [[Ellinev Del]], the delegate that [[Victor]] wanted [[Costi]] to meet, wants to meet with us, because she's investigating the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]] and related explosions (in coordination with [[Vigo Underswell]] and [[Ricci Scrucks]]. We discussed whether we wanted to talk to her, and decided it was probably a good way to figure out how to get access to [[Vigo Underswell]]'s office for [[Operation Incriminating Letters]]. So we decided we'd do that in the morning. 

Finally, we talked a bit more with [[Hugh]] about lying. We ended up playing two truths and a lie, to try to make the whole thing more fun. We learned that [[Rez]] has seen a dragon (from very far away), [[Costi]] has a school friend named Marius but who is known as Loops, [[Freya]] can skin a goat in under two minutes, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] has two brothers and isn't allergic to sesame seeds.
