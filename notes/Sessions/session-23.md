# Session 23: oh, it's ghosts 

We made it back to  [[The Golden Gryffon]], and [[Twigs]] immediately went to bed (your correspondent hopes they're feeling okay).

We talked a bit about [[Operation Incriminating Letters]]. Costi suggested we do a press tour, to disguise our interactions with our targets. Adrienne thinks it would be easy to set up that sort of meeting with [[Vigo Underswell]], but isn't sure how [[Norathar Pent]] would receive it -- and we all agreed that if we *can* pull this off without involving our real identities, we should. [[Rez]] suggested maybe we learn more about their hype-trafficking via [[The Stagehands]]. 

We're planning to do the thing on day 4/5, and create an alibi of dinner with [[The Miscasts]]. [[Rez]] wrote a note to schedule to [[Jenson Davour]]. Before then, we'll do some information gathering and come up with an actual plan. To that end, we're meeting [[Giary]] tomorrow night. He said it'll cost us. 

[[Rez]] asked if [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] might contact [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] and ask for information on our targets. this was a stupid question. 

Before bed, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] identified the [[Bag of Screams]] from [[Jecka]]'s room. It turns out to contain a corrupted human soul, in a bag, waiting to be sacrificed. so, there's that. 

We made plans to resume our normal routines [[session-24|tomorrow]], or at least appear to.
- [[Hugh]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] are going to the [[Praise District]]. Wasn't there another errand we were going to do in the praise district? Hm, probably not important. 
- [[Costi]] was hoping to visit the libraries at [[Redscale]], secretly looking for public records on our targets. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was going to come see if her alumni status would help. 
- [[Freya]] and [[Rez]] were going first to the [[Wayfinders]], then to [[The Promenade]]. There, they figured they could locate [[Norathar Pent]]'s lumber mill and do some reconnaissance. [[Freya]]'s ability to disguise herself and [[Rez]]'s best-stealth-in-the-bunch make them well suited to this task. If [[Twigs]] wakes up, this might be the kind of thing they're well suited to.
- Someone was going to go shopping, at some point. We used all our potions in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]].

With that figured out, we went to bed.

## And then we woke up 

[[Rez]] and [[Freya]] woke up to a table being thrown at them. [[Rez]] shouted about ghosts, which [[Hugh]] believed immediately and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] did not. 

Then, a series of mishaps.

Once the threat of ghosts had proven to be a genuine one, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] assumed a connection between these furniture-throwers and [[Jecka]]. So she picked up the [[Bag of Screams]] and offered it to them. This was a stupid decision. The ghosts weren't interested. But then, with the screaming, she couldn't put it down. 

[[Rez]] has mentioned this cool trick she can do sometimes where her chaos bolt gets doubled and hits someone new. And it happened! But it turns out, you can't poison a ghost. It looked cool, but that was pretty much it. 

[[Freya]] keeps forgetting that you can't bite a ghost. It's okay [[Freya]]. You'll get those dang ghosts eventually.

[[Costi]], never again wanting to sleep through an important moment, made himself *very speedy*. This was one of our few good ideas and it wasn't even *that* good an idea. 

[[Hugh]], as always, is the reason any of us are alive. 

Eventually we beat them back. [[Costi]] recognized these as the same type of creatures we saw in the [[Temple of Pelor outside Jalantar]], in [[Father Gryuu]]'s crypt. They probably came from the [[Summoning Stone]], not the [[Bag of Screams]]. So, getting that sorted out just moved up on our to-do list.
