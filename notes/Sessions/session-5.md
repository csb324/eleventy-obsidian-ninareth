# Session 5: whats up with these yaks

[[Brent]] - porter at [[Guruden Estate]]
[[Jalop]] is a farm fella (orc)

- Yaks have big claw marks and teeth marks and stuff 
- Adrienne's MO here is basically play a calm little farm song and stand back 
- Freya talked to a yak and asked *Who opened the door to the pen?*
	- Small, riding something that looked like a yak but wasn't a yak. A
	-  couple of things riding other things. 
	-  Animal thing had big claws 
- UH OH ITS [[Gruung]] probably. riding... bears?? or something like that. 
	- Rez confirms with minor illusion
- Frog guys lore: Fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to all other beings ! Dwell in trees! Strict caste system based on color ! Very poison! They enjoy enslaving other creatures and beings. 

Bossy little motherfuckers. Slaves are fed poison 

red is middle danger, gold is most 

Costi has a raven named Samuel. Samuel won't talk to him. what's that about 

Samuel rules. we stan a legend. 

we might set a trap for the gruung. 

Uh oh the grung found us. they lured us with a yak trap. Oh well. we're gonna kill em. 

known aliases for [[Freya]]: gruungslayer.

The bears are poisoned :( Clara loves the bears and Adrienne does not care about this at all

Slavery is technically legal but frowned upon in arkhosia 

Brent invited us to lunch with [[Willen Guruden]] 

We tell the green gruung we have changed our minds and we want to join team gruung. 

willem needs a word with Julian! Also, I told the group i work for Julian. I should clarify that. Do I want them to know I do? Or don't? Do I? Don't I? I need to think on this one.

Rez tannin ! 

Willem asks what costi thinks about Dharinov
