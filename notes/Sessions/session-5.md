# Session 5: whats up with these yaks
![](/assets/obsidian/comic%208.jpeg)

We visited the [[Guruden Estate]], where the [[Brent|porter]] showed us to the scene of the yak crime. (We also met [[Jalop]], a farmhand). [[Freya]] spoke with the witnesses (two yaks named Steven and ... something that started with a T) and got a description of, you guessed it, [[Gruung]]. Riding bears! [[Brent]] got us a bit more background on [[Gruung]] from the library at the [[Guruden Estate]].

We went into the woods to try to locate the [[Gruung]], thinking of setting a trap for them. We also talked to [[Costi]] about [[Samuel]] -- who refuses to communicate with [[Costi]] but nonetheless warned us that in fact the [[Gruung]] were waiting for US!

We killed most of the [[Gruung]] (and [[Hugh]] became friends with a bear, who had been mind-controlled by frog poison), and took the last one for questioning. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] convinced the hostage that we had seen the error of our disgusting human ways and wanted to aid the [[Gruung]] in their domination (while [[Freya]] hopped menacingly nearby) ([[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] did not want to be part of this, knowing it would end in violence). The [[Gruung]] 100% ate this shit up, and told us about the [[Gruung Attack on Tinzelven]] tomorrow morning. We swore fealty, recieved new gruung-loyal names, and killed him with a single swing of a new axe.

Then [[Willen Guruden]] invited us in for lunch, and we talked briefly about [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]], as well as [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] and various folks around town. He's informed [[Deeksta]] about the attack tomorrow. And we got paid! In coin (25 platinum) or favor (a piece of paper that says "help them out - WG")
