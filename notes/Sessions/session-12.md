# Session 12: [[Arazoak]]s and Errands

We pursued the set of footprints coming out the back of [[Fridian's Favor]], and managed to corner [[Kara]] in an alley. 

(First, we briefly ran into some guards and played it like we got attacked. they wanted to take us to the station for full statements, and while we tried to backtrack, the [[Vrolbekk Pixies]] saved our asses with a sleep spell. Thanks, pixies! But also, #todo: talk to guards again perhaps so we don't become suspect)

Anyway, [[Kara]] said the [[Zalevi Military|Zalevis]] took [[Zephra]], [[Rosco]], and [[Drenden]]. THEY were the hoofprints. 

We should assume at this point that anyone with a horse is a member of the zalevi military. 

We convinced Kara we weren't working for them, she basically figured out that we are bad at crime, and she told us to fuck off, she'd handle this. Which is good, because [[Rez]] did not want to become a fugitive in her home country (and in general, none of us want to be fugitives over this weird situation that fundamentally doesn't seem like our business).

But [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] stipulated that [[Zephra]] MUST get out alive, because she was going to fix Adrienne's harp in exchange for this favor, and Adrienne really didn't have 3000 gold to get it repaired elsewhere. So, leave [[Zephra]] alive, or, we would turn Kara in as well. Kara agreed, and we arranged a dead drop location. (Others found this somewhat unreasonable and demanded to know what the deal was with the harp. Adrienne agreed to discuss this with the party... later.)

Then we went back to [[The Gilded Instrument]] to get our things, and spoke to [[Raven]] who is understandably stressed about this. But raven also said the harp repair would cost 400 gold (a friends and former employees discount), which is WAY less than[[Zephra]] had quoted us. So. 

We checked into  [[The Golden Gryffon]], where we're staying in the admiralty suite. It's fancy AND nautical! 

[[Hugh]] went to the front desk and asked where he might get a repair. The concierge recommended [[St Jitterbig's Devotional Workshop]] in the [[Praise District]], so off he went. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was also heading to the [[Praise District]], and [[Costi]] came with her to try to find [[Hugh]]. meanwhile, [[Freya]] and [[Rez]] went to the [[Jalantar Wayfinders Outpost]] to check in.

Freya spoke to (old man) and asked about [[Akros]], as she was directed to do by [[R]]. Akros is out of town but she will keep checking in!

[[Rez]] mentioned to the wayfinder there that [[Father Gryuu]] could probably use more company, and fewer ghosts. Also mentioned the death of [[Tenali]], who was (it turns out) a dear friend of this guy. 

Meanwhile, [[Hugh]], a warforged wandering the city alone, was stopped by guards. suspicious of a warforged walking alone, they concluded that he must be malfunctioning. (Talking about his son didn't help.) Luckily, [[Costi]] had sent [[Samuel]] ahead and Samuel led us to [[Hugh]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] spoke up for him. They showed their documentation into the city and were left on their way but may not have made a great impression. 

[[Hugh]] and [[Costi]] then went to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]], the local temple to [[Moradin]] (and, to a lesser extent, [[TrueSilver]]). Hugh endured an incredibly painful repair, and had a nice talk with a nice dwarf, [[Father Thronestone]]. [[Costi]] fell asleep in yet another semi-public place. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], meanwhile, went to [[Corellon's Grove]] and asked a devotee to send a message for her to [[Fig]] and [[Bevin]]. She paid the fee, and then tried to engage in spirituality via gardening. It didn't go awesome, but she kept the shears, so she has those now.

After the forge, Costi and Hugh wanted to check out [[St Jitterbig's Devotional Workshop]]. They sure did, dude. Costi set up a meeting with a cleric who seems least likely to take [[Hugh]] apart and examine his insides. that's in a month or so. Costi also told the front desk person that he knew his parents, Boris and Karen, from the party, down the street from... you know! 

Finally, when we were all back at the hotel to meet [[Niko]] for dinner, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] explained where she got the harp -- she got sick on the road to [[Demphinster]] from [[Quaath]], and was dropped off at [[Temple of Corellon Outside Quaath]]. At the temple where she recovered, there was a very old harp that looked like it had once been quite nice, and to repay the [[Fig|people who healed her]], she decided to get it fixed. 

That's the short version. 

Anyway, now we're meeting [[Niko]] for dinner.
