# Session 43: 

We all watch them leave, then decide where to spend the night. Looks like this haunted house has been totally cleaned out. We decided to rest there, and [[Hugh]] makes a hut. [[Freya]] seems restless going to bed, wonder what that's about. [[Costi]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]] to message [[Costi's mom]] (she said [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]'s spy training camp often moved, but wanted more information into why [[Costi]] cared. [[Costi's mom]] says she last knew of him being on [[Breakers Bay]] coast of [[Eberron]] about 7 months ago.

[[Hugh]] sending's [[Qik]] to tell her [[Costi]] didn't mean to run out of town and leave her hanging. Costi tried to ask for help finding a way to apologize for ghosting her for two weeks. [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] had some interesting suggestions. 

Adrienne goes out to play her harp in nature, freya heads out later to look for anywhere that reminds her of home.

On the road we discuss the secret friend that [[Freya]] knows who will help us fight [[Threthdia Scrivit]], floundering with her lie, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] chimes in that [[Callgrim Pogleliggle]] had to be who it was - and TOTALLY seemed like he was connected in high places.

We walk back to [[Jalantar]]. One the way, we encounter some strange mushrooms on the ground - brown speckled with gold. We take a few, after [[Freya]] interogates a local lizard. [[Costi]] sendings to Prof. Krange to ask if he knows anything about this, she says to set them down and leave quickly. After some lamenting, we do.

Finding a nice place to camp tonight, we're suprpised by an attack of two banderhobss, a red cap, and a large blue creature with white hair and somewhat giant features who has a scroll with descriptions of [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] and a loose outline of when they can expect our return. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s keen eye says the handwriting looks quite like [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s. His glave is engraved in gaint, reading on one side: "sun's set" and "moons crest".
