We left [[Willen Guruden]]'s place in awkward silence, before talking a bit about whether we were going to stay [[Gruung Attack on Tinzelven|defend the town]]  or get the hell out. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is cautious (she isn't scared stop saying that [[Hugh]]). [[Freya]] seems interested in leaving too. 

(Of course we aren't going to.)

We bumped into [[Innis]], who IS leaving - [[Livia]] is needed in [[jalantar]] immediately for [[Wayfinders]] business, and Innis wants to get back to her girls. Her girls? Yeah she runs a brothel. sex work is work! [[The Fiddlers Respite]]? Something like that. 

Then we talked to [[Korvae]] ([[costi]] told him now is the time to panic, so he did) and then [[Deeksta]] (who did not appreciate the panic). Deeksta knows how to do her job, and had a very solid plan: act like we don't know anything, go to the party at the [[Laborers Hall]], make sure it's lit as hell, then go to bed early and be ready to funnel the gruung into the town square where we'll be waiting. maybe fifteen people in [[tinzelven]] are capable of fighting, so everyone else can stay out late. 

She asked us to get some paper and make some signs for the party. we got a LOT of paper from the [[Tack & Trade]] because we are insatiable for paper. It's on the captains tab. 

- [x] "What do an Island and the letter T have in common"

Then we made signs, and [[Rez]] (with freyas help) devised a plan for where to put them around town, to funnel the [[Gruung]] into the square. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh]] went to go make sure [[left side haircut]] was ready for a show tonight (the show MUST go on). [[Juliette]] seemed on board. Adrienne pressed her about rumors at [[Redscale]] and [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|heard a pretty amusing one]] 

Finally, [[Flick]] found [[Freya]] and gave her a message from... a [[Wayfinders|Wayfinder]]? Something like that.
