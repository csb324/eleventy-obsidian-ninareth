# Session 10

On our way to [[Jalantar]]! 

> Along the path from [[Tinzelven]] to Jalantar, we were hit by a smell. 14 humanoid bodies litter the clearing, damage to surrounding plants shows fighting with weapons. At least a few were killed in slings hung in the trees, like they were ambushed. Ragtag armor with no insignia or delineation is clear. Seem to have only been dead about a day, wounds enter from upwards, as though on horseback or very tall. Were not (thoroughly) looted. Niko inferred they were killed by the [[Captain Fretze|Zalevi guard contingent]]

We also met a **very small very angry little goat**. Turns out, it was a troll that Bel and Klida polymorphed for us. Thanks, [[Vrolbekk Pixies]]! 

In the evening, we came across a small temple set off the path, dedicated to  [[Pelor]] -- the Patron deity of the Wayfinders

- [[Father Gryuu]]: elderly orc who’s overseen the temple for about 40 years
- Has an issue with things in the crypt going missing (incense, matches), unexplainable sounds from the crypt at night for the last couple of weeks. 
- We went down into the crypt and discovered some sort of ghost, bulbous head and pointed ears, near the urn of Tenali. And some shadowy friends. We killed them though
- Found a hidden [[summoning stone]], looks like a small black rock, tied to a spirit. Barely magical at this point. 
- Gryuu couldn’t figure out anything about the stone. 
- Wayfinders keep track of where they stop along the way, so maybe they could figure out who left the stone here
- People do come through the temple to pay their respects, and Tenali died a few months ago
-  [[Tenali]]: former friend, wayfinder, worshiped Pelor -- DECEASED
