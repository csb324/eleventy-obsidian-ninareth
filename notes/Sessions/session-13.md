# Session 13: dinner with niko

Before meeting [[Niko]] for dinner, [[Costi]] found a mysterious box in his bag. It must be [[Niko]]'s! How did it get there? [[Rez|No one could possibly know]].

We discussed (again) our plan not to tell [[Niko]] about the [[Zephra Affair]] and the encounter with the [[Arazoak]]. We of course did not consider that we still look like shit. As soon as he saw us, he knew something had gone down. We told him we'd discuss it in private.

He took out the gems from [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], which he got verified. They are indeed real! We have gems! [[Hugh]] took the diamond, the rest are TBD.

[[Costi]] gave the box back, and [[Niko]] seemed relieved to have it. Also, he absolutely knew something was up. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] confirmed that [[Rez]] had taken it, via *message* in the "restroom". As for what was inside, a little money but mostly documents for [[The Providers]] nominating convention.

[[Rez]] also used the "restroom" to cast *message*. [[Hugh]] then excused himself to the restroom, by which he meant [[The Golden Gryffon]] lobby. When [[Loomis]] asked [[Hugh]] what was going on, he reported that he was using the restroom. This was not what Loomis wanted to hear. 

Anyways. We finished dinner, and [[Niko]] charged some *nice* bottles of whiskey to [[Willen Guruden]]'s account. Genuinely a small act of political sabotage. 

Upstairs, we came clean, and he kept close track of how many people had gotten our names -- [[Rez]]'s name, in particular. He advised us not to speak to the guards, and to specifically avoid [[Captain Fretze]] if we run into him. He also didn't want us going to the dead drop spot to get info from [[Kara]] -- it sounds like he'll be handling that instead.

(He made two marks on his paper -- one for [[Kara]] and one for [[Lish|the bartender]] at [[Fridian's Favor]], who he seemed to know).

He's staying with his friend [[Giary]] at [[The Sheath and Sickle]], in [[The Promenade]]. We have plans to meet him there in a couple days. ([[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] offered to keep him company tonight, but he said he had work to do... probably work that we created).

After [[Niko]] left, we spoke more about our plans. [[Loomis]] asked to speak with [[Costi]], and it *seems* he wanted to discuss the situation with [[Hugh]] and the "restroom". [[Costi]] also asked for more pillows. When he returned, he talked to [[Hugh]] about it, and [[Freya]] explained to [[Hugh]] what's going on with bathroom stuff. [[Hugh]] and [[Costi]] went back to the front desk so [[Hugh]] could apologize / explain. Poor [[Hugh]]. 

We had another talk about the buddy system, specifically for [[Hugh]] but also for all of us. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] mentioned that there's a bit of an edge underneath [[Niko]]'s demeanor. For now, we can trust him because his name is attached to [[Rez]]'s, so he has a clear incentive to keep us out of trouble. But we really don't know what his goals are, and we should keep an eye on that.

[[Costi]]'s pillows arrived, and he and [[Hugh]] went off to make a pillow fort. [[Hugh]] had never done this before but was excellent at it. The pillow fort was no girls allowed, but there was also a password. 

[[Rez]] tried for a very long time to guess the password, but never said "banana". Then, feeling forgettable and sulking about it, she went back to the hotel bar to sweep a beautiful woman off her feet. 

We talked for a minute about our plans for tomorrow, which are mostly errands. [[Freya]] got a new shield from the [[Jalantar Wayfinders Outpost]], and checked in on [[Akros]] who still hasn't arrived.
