# Session 14: trying to do errands with mixed results

First stop: [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. Hugh was there to pray and be a sweetie. Costi was there to meet a wizard -- and [[Father Thronestone]] let Costi know a few more details this time. The wizard in question is [[Professor Vendorsmere]], an instructor of arcane-swordstuff at [[Redscale]] (specifically, the Burbanks FIT). 

[[Rez]] wanted her face fixed. And, by god, she got her face fixed -- the copper scales now have a seam of silver running through them. It was painful, and expensive! Did she have the money? You bet she didn't. So, now she's signed up to spend two weeks working off her debt to the temple of [[Moradin]]. She's okay at it. 

Thronestone gave [[Rez]] some wine to get herself ready for a no-anestheisa surgical procedure. [[Freya]] joined her, in solidarity, and spent the rest of the morning pretty drunk.

Then we split up into team grove ([[Hugh]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]) and team bird food ([[Costi]] and [[Freya]]) (while [[Rez]] had her first day at ironworking school). 

**Team [[Corellon's Grove|Grove]]**: [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was reluctant to ask [[Hugh]] outright to join her, but he figured out that she wanted help! They went to [[Corellon's Grove]]. Adrienne couldn't find anyone who seemed like an authority, so [[Hugh]] asked a clearly grieving person for directions. They were very nice and said the space was open to anyone.

Adrienne asked Hugh how he knew what to even do when he was at the Hearth. Hugh said something along the lines of, "I liked these mushrooms, so I thought [[TrueSilver]] would also like these mushrooms, so I gave the mushrooms to her." This was surprisingly useful advice - Adrienne found a spot she liked, sat for a moment, and started to play harp sounds that she liked. And then an hour passed, very quickly. 

When Adrienne and Hugh were leaving, they noticed a [[Latharian Rose|blue rose]] and a note left near a bush. The note said "Thank you for your gift". When [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] went to the central building to ask about the message she sent yesterday, a volunteer named [[Rayenna]] explained that the blue rose is a rare flower associated with corellon, and that it was a very high compliment. She also mentioned an underground theater that Adrienne could audition to play at, and some Corellon activities in the [[Divian Wilds]].

**Team bird food:** [[Costi]] needs snacks for [[Samuel]], AND he's being EXTREMELY weird about something (but only [[Freya]] knows). They went to a store called [[The Black Gull]], a bird supplies store, and met [[Srictha]] and his bird, Klaus. [[Freya]] talked to Klaus for a while about how [[Samuel]] needs to learn how to do bird stuff. [[Costi]] had a similar conversation with [[Srictha]]. Turns out there's like, a dog-park-for-birds situation in the [[Divian Wilds]], so we may go there. 

When [[Costi]] was checking out, he asked the owner, a halfling named [[Trindleswip]], about a box for him. There was no box. This was a weird thing to ask. [[Freya]], sobering up, noticed this and asked what the hell he was talking about. [[Costi]] wouldn't tell her much, but said he would maybe tell her things once he found out more things. Right now there's no box, so there's nothing to say about the box. secrets!! 

They then went to the [[Burbank FIT]] to try to make an appointment with [[Professor Vendorsmere]]. The girl handling check-in was not impressed at all. 

Finally we reconvened. We found out that [[Rez]] is a bit sloppy with her ironwork, so [[Costi]] bet her a platinum piece if she could do five perfect pours in a row. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] talked about the importance of learning your scales on a musical instrument, but admittedly harp is [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s number one passion in life, and ironworking is something Rez picked up today to get out of paying 100 gold, so it's not exactly the same situation. 

On our way out of the praise district, we thought we'd drop off the [[summoning stone]] at the [[Temple of Pelor in Jalantar]]. They wouldn't take it, (specifically, a dragonborn named [[Ickthin]]) but they're going to let us make an appointment. [[Rez]] has the stone now.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] bought a forgery kit, and [[Costi]] couldn't find a lockpicking kit - but we went to a cheap music store and found him a Karimba to disassemble. The little narrow teeth-guys might work in a jam.

Now, we're headed to the [[Seven Hooves]], a sort of rowdy bar on the southern end of  [[The Academy District]].
