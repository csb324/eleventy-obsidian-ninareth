# Session 20: [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in|PRISON BREAK]]
We were in the History halls of the [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar]], and [[Freya]] noticed a lever. At around the same time, an unrelated explosion went off. 

## Combat 1: The History Halls
We signaled [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] to blow some shit up with the [[Ring of Concussion]]. [[Rahbu]], who was waiting with us, figured out that we were being pretty shifty. 

Combat ensued. We pulled the lever Freya had noticed and opened a secret staircase! And also, we killed [[Rahbu]] -- and the two other guards assigned to keep us safe. 

> Fretze was right about you

> - [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], with a killer insult

After the explosion, our friends [[Innis]], [[Giary]], and [[Kara]] came in to join us. We quickly tried to make the bodies look like they were exploded, rather than stabbed, then put on our [[Hawktails]] disguises and ran down the stairs.

(Costi showed a particular talent for dismembering corpses. So. Uh. That's interesting.)

Downstairs, we came across a large prison cell. [[Niko]] and the [[Arazoak]] weren't in there, but [[Qik]] was! This seemed to be where they were keeping their low-risk prisoners. Anyway, [[Innis]] escorted them out. 

Then, [[Kara]] and [[Giary]] went one way, while [[Our Party]] went another. More stairs led to more prison cells and more guards.

## Combat 2: The Prison
These prison cell locks would coat your hands in liquid metal if you tried to open them incorrectly. [[Costi]] learned this the hard way. The rooms were also heavily trapped with firearms. 

The [[Zalevi Military]] seems to have an advantage when they're stabbing down at you, even if that means they're standing on, like, a desk. So, that's something for us to be aware of. 

We took out the first round of guards, who seemed to be on high alert. In the first cells, we found [[Rosco]] and a weird guy who later told us his name was [[Kel]]. Or, at least, that's what we could call him. Seriously, he was a *weird* guy. 

[[Rez]] has cultivated chaos into a skill. A combination of a torch, oil, and an immovable rod bought us a little bit of time before the next round of guards showed up -- including [[Sogha]] and her pet, a displacer beast (a.k.a. thundercat). [[Sogha]] had never trusted us, and was delighted to be proven right. 

More combat! Punches: punched! Spears: Thrown! [[Freya]]: Temporarly trapped on the wrong side of a door! Portents: Portentious! 

[[Hugh]] got the killing blow on [[Sogha]], who was retreating -- which would have been incredibly bad for us, since she had figured out who we were under the masks. This is the second time that's happened to him lately. Hopefully that won't have psychological repercussions! 

## Rescue
Finally, we were able to track down a ring of keys and set the four prisoners free ([[Niko]], [[Rosco]], [[Zephyra]], and [[Kel]]). [[Niko]] asked what our plan was, and we told him we were going to go back upstairs and make it look like we'd been innocent, terrified bystanders. Except, we were covered in blood, so this might be a tougher sell than we thought. Anyway, [[Niko]] had a better idea -- he could take us as hostages. 

We gave him [[Grounder]] back, and he aimed it at our heads. [[Zephyra]] apologized to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], while holding a knife to her throat. More Zalevi guards arrived, including one who [[Niko]] seemed to know. They had a brief conversation, while we looked convincingly scared and helpless. 

Zalevis take their responsibility as hosts very seriously. So, when the choice was "get [[Niko]] and kill the hostages" or "Let [[Niko]] go and protect those nice people we invited over," they chose the second one -- and we escaped to safety, through the sewers.

> [[Rosco]]: If I throw you down there will you make it?
 >[[Freya]]: Yeah, I just want to get out of this shithole
 >[[Rosco]]: From one shithole to another

 [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] used the [[Circlet of Sending]] to talk to [[Giary]], who confirmed that he and [[Kara]] also rescued [[Drenden]] and [[Sarker]]. All [[Arazoak]] are accounted for, per our agreement. 

We took a circuitous route to an [[Underground Safehouse]], and that's where we're hanging out for the moment. 

I have a sneaking suspicion that we are going to have some *conversations* down here.
