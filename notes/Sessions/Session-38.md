# Session 38: Let's rip some arms off

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] recovered from her sessionpox just as [[The Unforged Few]] was coming back from the potluck at the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. They were ready to cut off some arms! [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] had follow up questions. I wouldn't say they were answered completely to her satisfaction, but the situation did seem urgent. 

(She also got caught up on everything going on with [[Threthdia Scrivit]] -- mostly that we need to be careful at night, because the [[Banderhobbs]] are really good at kidnapping people when it's dark out).

We walked down to [[The Fallsides]], stopping on the way to buy some weapons that might look like dragon claw marks. Our plan, at that point, was to break into this weird little hideout and make it look like all the dragon-cultists killed each other. We also disguised ourselves, via magic or makeup. [[Rez]] added some gold to her natural scales, to appeal to [[Burru Ilp]]'s affinity for [[Galaphanel]].

We got to [[Burru Ilp]]'s house, which was not a weird little hideout but actually a quite ostentatious mansion. This man was not subtle at all. It's basically *the Tiamat house* on this very fancy block. Five colors of stone and jewels, and dragon stuff everywhere. The gate was ajar, so we entered carefully and saw that the whole bottom floor had been abandoned, ransacked, et cetera. Anything metal or shiny was gone, and it looked like no one had been up here in a while. Upstairs was even worse, or at least, dustier.

The general decor vibe of this place was: dragons are so cool. One interesting fresco stood out as one that none of us recognized (the rest were mostly [[The Three Dragons War|well-known world events]], unfamiliar only to [[Freya]]). On one panel, a group of dwarves surrounding a silver dragon. On the next panel, those same dwarves celebrating around a boulder. 

We also found out that [[Azir DarAxia|Saint Goldborn]]'s nephew [[Caleb DarAxia]] is a foremost scholar on dragon things. [[Burru Ilp]] had his books. 

[[Costi]], who was a *total* dragon kid, found it very easy to step into [[Burru Ilp]]'s mindset and locate the secret entrance to the basement. So that's where we went.

A fellow named [[Sqwank]] opened the door, and was initially a bit menacing, but seemed impressed by [[Rez]]'s scales. He had his arm wrapped up in bandages. He brought us to [[Burru Ilp]], who had an arm that was swirls of red and blue dragon scales. He was a weird guy! [[Costi]] (as *Vosk*) said he too felt that he was the descendant of [[Galaphanel]]. [[Burru Ilp]] gave him a big sniff and decided, yes, this was true.

There was a [[weird boulder]] in the basement, by the way.

Our plan to infiltrate was going pretty well, until he invited us to watch him work. His patient, [[Cortis]], was a halfling who did *not* want incredibly dangerous dragon-grafting surgery. He was begging for help. We tried to tell [[Burru Ilp]] that someone who does not *understand* the glory of their draconic heritage doesn't *deserve* to see its fruit, but [[Burru Ilp]] guy was committed to cutting this guy's arms open. We all get that feeling sometimes, I guess.

Anyway, [[Rez]] had finally had enough and cast Hold Person on Burru. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] followed suit. 

## Combat ensued. 

[[Hugh]] freed [[Cortis]], and asked for his help. [[Cortis]] said "sure whatever" and ran away, so [[Hugh]] knocked him out again. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] made a big deal about [[Freya]] having the true draconic powers, what with her claws and all. [[Costi]] disguised himself as [[Sqwank]] and managed to convince the Paladin of [[Bahamat]] (yes, a paladin of [[Bahamat]] was there; his name was [[Jorus]]) that he had the keys and everyone was leaving. 

Point being, we killed everyone, except [[Cortis]] -- who was immediately willing to tell us everything.

- He was just a bartender in [[The Promenade]], until he met [[Burru Ilp]] who smelled within him the blood of [[Galaphanel]]. 
- He was like... okay cool? Thanks?
- [[Burru Ilp]] helped him make money, let him know about some investments, and he was able to buy his bar and generally thrive financially.
- This weird guy liked [[Galaphanel]] a lot, but, whatever, it seemed casual.
- Until a few weeks ago, when things got out of hand.

[[Cortis]] pointed us in the direction of [[Burru Ilp]]'s journals, which were written in code. He broke the code for us, so, it should be pretty easy to decipher now. We need to figure out what to do with the information.

One more person knew about the grafting -- a man from [[Thelran Asari]]  named [[Pleetos Alentas]]. He was going back to the [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]] to pass along the knowledge, presumably.

[[Cortis]] swore he would not mention us, but also made it pretty clear that he's going to figure out who we are, because clearly we're *somebody*. Fair enough.

**Our cover story** is that we were never here. [[Cortis]] would say he'd been on a bender for days, woke up to a trashed house, and left. Eventually, someone will discover a dungeon clearly set up for some sort of cult activity, and a heap of dead bodies in the bodies-chute (yes, there was a bodies-chute). The obvious answer is that the cultists killed each other, driven mad by dragon powers. This is like, 98% true anyway. 

## One more thing.

[[Cortis]] also told us a little more about the [[weird boulder]]. Apparently [[Burru Ilp]] spent a ton of money on it, and according to legend, it contains a part of a silver dragon that was turned into a stone. 

[[Costi]] kissed it. It felt warm. [[Rez]] also kissed it, IIRC. They agree that something is going on with this rock. This is not a normal rock. It's a [[weird boulder]].
