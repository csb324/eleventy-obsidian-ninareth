# Session 33: 

## Before the Bellissime

* [[Hugh]] started planning a Get to Know TrueSilver open house at the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]
* [[Costi]] practiced his sword and went on his date with [[Qik]]
* [[Rez]] hung out with [[Vask]], and practiced metal working. She worked with [[Costi]] to plant the first few Vask-fishing letters courtesy of an unwitting [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] 
* [[Freya]] 
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] had a lot of work for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]].

**[[Costi]]'s date with [[Qik]]:** He brought her flowers! She had one of her clients set up a boat for them at [[Gorva's Resovoir]]! They tried to both row the boat and it did not work! [[Samuel]] was there! There was a light show! A date for the ages, truly.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was busy with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] but was able to get some time to go to the [[Corellon's Grove|grove]]. She also asked [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] whether there was anything he needed in particular from the group. He said to keep an eye on [[Rez]] (because, who knows), encourage [[Costi]]'s political aspirations (puzzling!), and make sure [[Freya]] knows which fork to use at the [[Bellisme Show]]. 

The group also got new clothes for the concert. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s, directed by [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] - but the rest of the group got to choose their own. [[Hugh]] wore a suit embedded with sapphire dust. [[Costi]] got a number of red herrings embroidered on the inside of his coat, and asked for a raven-feather cloak. [[Freya]] and [[Rez]] wore some outfits you've probably seen before.

## The show, part 1

On our way into [[The Pirate Queen]], a dark-skinned gnome got into our carriage. He had a staff badge, and he said his name was [[Neiragneg]], and that his job tonight was to facilitate a meeting between [[Rez]] Tannin ("it's Tanin") and his boss, [[Rhend Triverswill]]. He clearly had some connection with the [[Fire Raisers]], but also seemed to think *we* were the ones connected to the [[Fire Raisers]]. 

Pretty much everyone we've ever met was at the opening reception. [[Victor]], who we talked to about the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]] and [[Niko]], [[Ellinev Del]], who we talked to about [[Vigo Underswell]]'s arrest briefly, [[Relakas]] and [[Ricci Scrucks]], who we learned rejoined the [[Dragon's Hide]] after [[Norathar Pent]]'s arrest -- he is shocked at the crimes she and [[Limley]] got into, apparently. 

Then we got a message from the [[Fire Raisers]] that they wanted [[The Unforged Few]] to help them with a task later. [[Costi]] got the message, said yes, then read it again and noticed that they'd actually asked for all of our help. Whoops lol.

[[Vask]] pranked [[Rez]] by pretending to be guards believing she was a terrorist due to missing / improper papers. [[Rez]] caught on pretty quick, but it was a well done prank, AND it made us remember we need to get that taken care of. 

On our way up to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s suite, [[Winnie|someone dressed as a Jalantan Guard]] got into our elevator. This was the help that the [[Fire Raisers]] had asked for -- she needed our assistance distracting a guard. [[Rez]] did her one better and cast invisibility, and then [[Costi]] asked to use the restroom, and we just acted like we were lost. [[Winifey|Winnie]] climed into a crawlspace in the ceiling.

[[Winifey|Winnie]] also introduced herself to [[Neiragneg|Neir]]. It was becoming even less clear who knew how much about what.

Back at the Circler's Lounge, we met some folks, and [[Costi]] *detected* some of their *thoughts*:
* [[Sienna Burbank]], whose name is on the gym we keep going to. She's a friend of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s who did not want to be left trying to make conversation with [[Henrik]]. She didn't seem to have any surface-level ulterior motives -- just excited for a good concert.
* [[Threthdia Scrivit]], who seemed like a nice old lady but was actually burning with white-hot murderous rage. Apparently, she'd asked to see [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[The Unforged Few]], so [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] mostly left her alone while he was talking to...
* [[Vel Scrooks]], whom [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] met with privately in a side room, and whom we didn't really talk to.

We all settled in and saw the [[Bellisme Show]]. It was quite a show! She's a very talented singer!

## Talking to the Magi

Finally, some friend of [[Neiragneg|Neir]]'s showed up and said it was *time*. So we went up to the rafters, and spoke with the Magi [[Rhend Triverswill]], a deputy Magi at [[The Slavaadi College]]. He was working on the [[Bellisme Show]]'s illusionary effects, and he's a big fan of the [[Fire Raisers]]. 

[[Rez]] had a great idea, which was to ask if [[Rhend Triverswill|Triverswill]] could turn her into a dragon. She thinks it would be cool to be a dragon.

He can't. But he said he'd set up an appointment with the Archmage. Then he asked [[Neiragneg|Neir]] to set up an appointment with the Archmage. [[Neiragneg|Neir]] said it would be difficult. 

While we were there, [[Rhend Triverswill|Triverswill]] also took a look at [[Costi's Sword]]. He noticed that it's closely connected with [[Samuel]], and that it's full of "undifferentiated" magical energy. Basically, it's full of potential. [[Costi]] mentioned that [[Costi's Dad|his dad]] was a warlock, which is news to us.

Finally, [[Rhend Triverswill]] left, and told us to get on the next elevator. But before it could arrive, [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] were *attacked*... and we ended on a cliffhanger.
