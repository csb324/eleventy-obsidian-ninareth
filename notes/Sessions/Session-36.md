# Session 36: Julian gets some of the truth

[[Rez]] temporarily got a rash. 

The rest of us spent the morning talking about the events of the night before. [[Costi]] was feeling disillusioned with the [[Fire Raisers]]. [[Freya]] was straight up angry. [[Hugh]] was lobbying to go to [[Eberron]] next, in our search for [[Costi's Dad]] -- and set up drinks tonight with [[Magister]] to talk about it. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] said she still needed to sort things out with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. And a couple other things. 

[[Hugh]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] went to the praise district. At [[Corellon's Grove]], Adrienne asked [[Dawenys]] some questions she wasn't entirely equipped to answer. Such as "why can I suddenly feel a fiend in my hotel room?"

> "When a person feels strongly about a god, or a concept, or a thing, or a person, or a place, or that god, or concept, or person or thing or place feels strongly about them... sometimes this can happen"
> -- [[Dawenys]], on where paladins come from 

The long and short of it was that [[Corellon Larethian]] likes [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and *sometimes it be like that*. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was not completely satisfied with this answer, but she was given much to consider.

[[Hugh]] oversaw some potluck preparations at the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] [[TrueSilver|Hearth]]. He performed a small miracle and returned with pies. 

## Donkey Butt

Back at  [[The Golden Gryffon]], [[Costi]] delivered a coded message to [[Henrik]], presumably for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. The content of the message was largely "donkey butt".

The Listening Stone responded, and summoned [[Costi]] to a meeting. So he and [[Freya]] went to the lobby for coffee, and then [[Costi]] disappeared. [[Freya]] drank his coffee. 

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] was waiting with another enchanted stone -- this one containing a Zone of Truth spell. "Is the official story of how you got out of the embassy that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] told me true?" He explained [[Costi]]'s options: tell me the truth about what happened in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]], or I will find out from [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]], [[El'Haliand]], et cetera. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] knew [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] had lied about something there, and he wanted to know what. And [[Costi]] owed him the answer to a question. So, it was time to settle his debts. 

After some protest, [[Costi]] told [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]  more about what happened. Importantly, not everything. He referred to the [[Fire Raisers]] as "[[Niko]]'s compatriots" who had an underground "hideout", but he didn't say we were responsible for the explosion. 

He also told [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] "â€œI hate you very much and you have made me want to do everything in my power to really foil every thing you do now..... oh. wow. Fuck you." which must have felt good. 

[[Henrik]] served [[Costi]] horse flank for lunch. Donkey butt. 

## Guess who is not chill about this

[[Costi]] and [[Freya]] went back to the room, where [[Rez]] was feeling better. He filled them both in on what happened, and [[Rez]] used the [[Circlet of Sending]] to tell [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], who was just meeting up with [[Hugh]] to head back anyway. She BOOKED IT. This has been a Very Fucked Up 24 Hours. 

Tension ensued, as you might imagine. [[Costi]] said [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was just like [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], which was a low blow. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was condescending enough to him that she probably deserved it. 

**In the middle of this very tense conversation,** [[Victor]] came over! [[Ellinev Del]] and the rest have asked him to step into [[Vigo Underswell]]'s seat as overseer of the southern publics. He basically just delivered that news and left, because the vibes were *wild* in a bad way. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] decided there was probably no reason to continue pretending [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] had her loyalty. They both know she lied, and they both know how he responds to that, and maybe the best thing is to walk away now before things get worse. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] wanted to be the one to bring this up, rather than waiting for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] to do it when the moment served him. 


## On the mountain 

Off we went to [[Guspen Resort]]! [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] was on the mountain, and had given their information to the ski-concierge-people (requesting a brightly colored childrens toboggan for [[Costi]] 

- [[Freya]] was straight up the best skier there. People want to take lessons from her. 
- [[Hugh]] went tobogganing and had a fantastic time. They'd never seen snow before, and it's great!
- [[Costi]] was distracted by how much he hates [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], who was his usual friendly self when they arrived at the resort. 
- [[Rez]], who has never had a bad time in her life, went down the mountain on a snowboard face first.
- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] skied alongside [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] and tried to have a conversation. The gist of this was "I know you know, and I do not appreciate you threatening [[Costi]]. I submit my resignation." [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] said "no, you don't. It's not a good time for me. After the elections, that would be an okay time for you to resign. And resigning when it is not convenient for me will become very uncomfortable for you."
	- He also seemed to want [[Costi]] to help him with a job in the next little while. 
	- Adrienne tried to emphasize the fact that [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] travels together now, and if [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] needed to speak to them she'd like to be his point of contact. Also, that he shouldn't threaten them anymore in general. 
	- To this he basically said "lmao I don't need to threaten you *anymore*"

Finally, after dinner [[Hugh]] met up with [[Magister]] as planned. [[Magister]] said it wasn't a good time for us to come with him and [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] to [[Eberron]]. She's working on some kind of family project, apparently. But [[Magister]] promised he'd stay in touch and keep helping [[Hugh]] understand who he is.
