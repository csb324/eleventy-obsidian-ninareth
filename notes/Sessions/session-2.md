# Session 2

We go get the emerald from [[Hanna Dimbleswelter]]'s lab! 

On the way to the lab, we're attacked by [[frog guys]]. The frog guys apparently have seen Freya, Hugh, and Costi before, and have sworn veeeaannnggaaance. We didn't kill all of them, so they probably still want veeeaannnggaaance.

Anyway, we get to the lab, work our way through, and fight some elemental type things, and a few mimics. 

We kill them and get the thrice-travelled emerald. And then we fight about what to do with it. [[Costi]] kisses it. [[Rez]] wants it for herself because she thinks it's cool. [[Costi]] also thinks [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] is some kind of evil nefarious man who shouldn't have nice things. So we vote, and we decide not to give it to Klipitz ([[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout]] in the minority.)

That doesn't go well. Rez tries to insist this was all a big prank. Klipitz doesn't buy it, but docks our pay and moves on with his life. We think. Anyway, he says to stay in town and he'll pay us even more if his machine works. So we do.
