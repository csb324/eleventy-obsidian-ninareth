# Session 34: Ceiling stuff, mostly

## Fighting in the rafters

Where we left off: [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] were grabbed by big creatures in the rafters. There was also a third, smaller creature.

We fought those creatures! [[Neiragneg|Neir]] can construct things on the fly, which was super usesful. [[Freya]] noticed that these things sort of looked like [[Gruung]], and we know what she does to [[Gruung]]. [[Rez]] sang one of the creatures a lullaby. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] had the good idea to use a lamp. The smaller creature was wearing big boots, and he kicked [[Hugh]] in the chest.

After the fight, [[Costi]] let us know that all those creatures were from [[The Feywild]], probably. We also noticed that they didn't expect [[Neiragneg|Neir]] to be there -- and that they'd seemed to target [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] in particular.

Adding those pieces together, we thought, perhaps this is connected to [[The Beauties of Shadow]]. The [[Beauties of Shadow Dog Tag]] was written in Sylvan, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] specifically antagonized those witches by attuning to their [[Circlet of Sending]] and [[Rez]] might have been carrying it at the time. Or, if not, she certainly uses it pretty often. 

## Back to the Circler's Lounge

In any case, we cleaned ourselves up and went back to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s box, where he was talking to some old and new business contacts -- [[Captain Fretze]], [[El'Haliand|Finn El'Haliand]], and an Eberronian general, [[Rhicka Surtev]]. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] was trying to sell [[Rhicka Surtev]] a piece of art.

[[El'Haliand]] formally apologized to us for what we *went through* at their embassy. We also discussed the ongoing craziness all over the [[Southern Cities]]. Apparently there have been fires in [[Arkhosia (City)]], caravans have been attacked in [[Zalev]], [[Mulfara]] is also having increased discontent, and pretty much everyone in the conversation expects tension and trouble between the [[Southern Cities]] to increase.

When they left, [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] asked what the hell happened. We said we had a meeting in the rafters (true) and then we were attacked by creatures from the feywild (true). [[Costi]]  decided to offer [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] an exchange of information, believing he could trade the true story of the sapphire tooth for an explanation for [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s murderous rage.

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] did tell us more about [[Threthdia Scrivit]]. Her family has been illustrious for generations, but he doesn't think there's a family at all -- he believes she is the same being, who keeps reinventing herself as the next generation. He believes she is non-human, and possibly Fey.

He was not interested in [[Costi]]'s tooth. He will let [[Costi]] know when it's time to pay that debt. Good luck, buddy.

## The Miscasts' show

We, the conclusions-jumpers, decided [[Threthdia Scrivit|Scrivit]] was probably on her way to wreak havoc with [[The Miscasts]] before their show! We had to stop her! So [[Rez]] used the [[Circlet of Sending]] to warn [[Jenson Davour]], and we made our way to the western crows nest to see their show.

[[Jenson Davour]]  brought us backstage, where we warned him about the *(checks notes)* [[Threthdia Scrivit|secretary of arts and culture]], who is actually a soul-eating murder machine. He said, okay, uh, duly noted. But meanwhile, [[Josh|Jinx]] was upset about not getting a bigger venue -- another band, called [[Rike's Rats]], beat them out. [[Rez]] gave the band a cheerful pep talk. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gave [[Josh|Jinx]] a more forceful talking-to about his attitude, and low-key offered to murder [[Rike's Rats]]. She was just trying to prove a point, but this one may not age well.

We also mentioned to [[Lorian]] that maybe it would be good if he and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] were seen to be having an affair. He seemed on board.

[[The Miscasts]] took the stage, and they *nailed it.* We stan a *legend*. Their show was the best kept secret of the Bellisime, and we made sure to start saying that to people at the afterparty.

## Afterparty

Finally(?) everyone ended up in Lillith Hall, where there was food and drink and dancing. [[Neiragneg|Neir]] asked us what we were called, and we didn't have an answer. So, with his support we came up with a name! Our party is now known (to us) as [[The Unforged Few]]. 

Helping the inept organize their thoughts is one of [[Neiragneg|Neir]]'s strong suits.

[[Magister]] took [[Hugh]] up to the roof for cigars and drinks, and introduced him to the [[The Self Made Men]]

## The Attack

> the roof, the roof, the roof is on fire. the [[From the Ashes Flyer]], Ash Monsters and that whole shit

> â€” Chelsea's original recap, which is genuinely flawless

We fight with a lot of friends and around a whole bunch of innocents bystanders. [[Vask]], [[Victoria Several]], [[Magister]], [[Relakas]], [[Ricci Scrucks]] and some guards fight. 

As we break down the big ash monsters [[Winifey]] shows back up and says "no don't kill it!" Too late, we do. And things get WORSE. 

everyone almost goes down, things get dark. the [[Fire Raisers]] bit off more they can chew, and everyone gets into their feelings.

[[Hugh]] panicks and mistrusts [[Magister]], but learns he was trying to help. [[Costi]] jumped on a fire grenade and puts it in his wrist pocket. [[Rez]] swallows her pride and uses a cold dragon breath to help save the party and [[Vask]], who went down. 

[[Ricci Scrucks]] thanks us for our help in the fight and sends us home. [[Hugh]] grives for those who died, [[Costi]] is rethinking some of his impressions of the [[Fire Raisers]], [[Rez]] is visibly angry and worried for [[Vask]]'s life. He helps her feel better. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] wonders about the implications, and shakes off almost dying. [[Freya]] looked fine.
