# Session 0
[[Adrienne Spout]], [[Rez]], and [[Innis]] are travelling with a cheerful orc [[Wayfinders | wayfinder]] to [[Jalantar]]. We got stopped by some pixies who asked for help getting their speedy cousin to leave their pond. Also they broke our carriage. Anyway, in the pond we found some boxes -- one with an immovable rod, and one with something belonging to [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], who lives in [[Tinzelven]] -- right on our path to Jalantar.
