[[Rez]] wakes up with [[Deeksta]] and finds out about some jobs the [[Tinzelven Town Guard]] might need help with:
- [[Willen Guruden]] had some yaks killed last night, and he's the captain, so it semes like he's gonna pay more.
- [[Korden]] has some sort of crop circle problem that objectively sounds more interesting.

([[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] also wakes up, we just did a whole bunch of morning-after stuff)

[[Our Party]] catches up over breakfast. Freya talks to Hugh and Costi about her magic situation. Rez lets us know there are some things going on, and we agree to take on the Yak problem. 

First we go to the clothing store and talk to... a [[Victor|fella costi talked to earlier]] and his armoring [[Bliken Hammerov|dwarf friend]]. [[Hugh]] buys some new clothes. Then we go to the [[Tack & Trade]], where [[Rez]] hears a cool story about a ring but does not buy it. 

We find out about a [[Laborers Hall]] party from the fella and the dwarf. They invite us. The dwarf is a delegate for [[The Providers]] party. [[Costi]] is ENTHRALLED. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] encourages him not to sign up for any crusades before he knows waht the hell is going on. [[Hugh]] encounters anti-warforged racism.

We made it to the [[Guruden Estate]]. YAKS INCOMING.
