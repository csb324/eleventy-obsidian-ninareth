# Session 1

Waiting with [[Gora Klipitz]] in [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]'s lab, his dang robots get out of hand. [[Niko]] runs in because this is the sort of thing he's paid to fix, and we help subdue the rogue robots because we're all in the room. We meet [[Freya]], [[Hugh]], and [[Costi]] (who is drunk).

Klipitz asks us to go get the emerald from [[Hanna Dimbleswelter]]'s lab.
