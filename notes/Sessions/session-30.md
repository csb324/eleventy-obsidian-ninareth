# Session 30: Ambushed! Twice! Sort of!

Well, we tried to reason with [[Limley]].

She lost her job, and she's pissed about it. She mostly wanted to know [[Fire Raisers|who hired us]], which was not a question we were willing to answer. [[Rez]] tried to convince her that we were going to write an article about the bad workplace conditions at [[Pent Logging]], and now that [[Limley]] didn't work there anymore, she could probably ruin [[Relakas]]'s career too. [[Limley]] said, "That's a good idea, and I'm also going to kill you."

So anyway, we killed [[Limley]]. 

The folks she brought with her decided this wasn't worth dying for, so they left when the tide turned. The purple dragonborn, [[Perzeiros]], told [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] they'd probably meet again soon. 

Back at the hotel, we identified [[Vigo Underswell]]'s vial. It's [[Sovereign Glue]]! It's a good thing no one drank it. We also identified [[Limley]]'s [[Flame Tongue Longsword]], which [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] quite likes.

[[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] went out to do some kind of errand but your correspondent doesn't know what. [[Costi]] was busy practicing how to pick locks, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] had practicing to do, and [[Freya]] seemed distracted -- so no one went with them.

On the way to dinner, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asked [[Freya]] why she was so distracted. It turns out, she heard from [[Niko]] about the [[Mysterious Circles]]! [[Niko]] told her (via self-destructing letter) that [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]  recognized the symbol from his studies. So [[Freya]] had a lot on her mind.

We met [[The Miscasts]] at [[Kalikar's Bistro]]! A very fancy place, with very tasty food. [[Costi]] tried drugs for the first time, and seemed to enjoy it. [[Hugh]] remains very worried about [[Rian]] - specifically whether he has any injuries. [[Rian]] seemed to want to catch up with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] but maybe he's just friendly. Or maybe it's a scheme! You never know, thinks Adrienne.

And *speaking of schemes...*

[[Jenson Davour]] pulled aside [[Rez]], [[Freya]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], saying he had a friend who wanted to meet them in private. Having been ambushed earlier that day, we were hesitant, but [[Jenson Davour]] assured [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], at least, that he didn't want to cross [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] either. So, they went into the room next door, which *as it turns out* has a one-way mirror into the room where we were having dinner.

In the room next door, darkness. A line of candles. A figure in a black robe wearing a porcelain mask. [[Jenson Davour]] was permitted to sit in the corner. Major cult vibes.

The figure introduced themself as [[The Curator]], and invited the three of us to join their [[The Collection|collection]]. From each of us, they wanted a gift. From [[Freya]], a story. From [[Rez]], a joke (preferably bawdy). And from [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], a song (preferably classical).

Let the record show that we did hesitate. We don't totally know what being a part of this collection means. But the way [[The Curator]] put it, we would be encouraged to just keep doing what we're doing (they've been *watching* us). And if we needed help, they could potentially put us in touch with the right people. Because [[The Collection]] is pretty cool.

[[Freya]] agreed first. She answered some questions about snow foxes, and signed her name.

[[Rez]] joined next. She made an excellent dick joke at [[Jenson Davour]]'s expense. [[The Curator]] liked it.

And finally, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] agreed. She played a song on the harp, signed her name, and tried to ask [[Jenson Davour]] what the fuck he'd just gotten them into. [[The Curator]] did not appreciate this attempt at communication. But when we left the room, [[Jenson Davour]] made it clear that we just got **ourselves** into this.
