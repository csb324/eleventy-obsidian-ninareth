# Session 28 (short morning camping session!)

We visted [[Ellinev Del]]! She's a lady, and an artificer, it seems. We made our way through the [[Divian Wilds]] (where we walked past a zoo) to [[Gorva's Observatory]]. 

She took out a notebook.

She asked us to repeat our story about the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]. [[Costi]] had a good feeling about how insightful she was going to be, and he was right - she seemed to believe us. We volunteered to speak with anyone else who might need to hear our account, and she said it would be easy to get time with [[Vigo Underswell]] in [[The Publics]]. He's been wanting to talk to us. 

She also mentioned that the zalevi embassy bomb broke the pattern of the other explosions -- including a new one yesterday. So, those are still happening. 

(The [[Fire Raisers]] need to chill out. They're getting in their own way here.)

Anyway, we asked if we could also talk about [[Hugh]], and she took out a new notebook. 

She asked [[Hugh]] a few questions, then sent them out of the room. It turns out, she's seen something like this before, with warforged from [[Eberron]] (specifically the [[Eberronian Military]]). They have a protocol they do when a warforged isn't serving its purpose, which sounds like what would cause the memory gaps. She advised us not to push him to remember things his mind is blocking -- lest we cause more internal damage. But a master artificer, with knowledge of the Eberronian techniques, could probably reverse it.  

[[Costi]] also wanted to talk about politics. She took out another notebook. 

She was warm, and seemed like a straight shooter -- someone who just wants to get to the bottom of things. If we can keep up our web of lies, she'd be a great friend to have.
