# Session 26: Puppies, Pie, Pent Logging

[[session-25|Last session]] we set up a plan. This session we executed it. And we executed it pretty successfully!

## But first, an awkward wizard moment
Something is going on with [[Costi]]. When he woke up this morning, he looked like [[Qik]]. It turns out, he now has the ability to look like whatever he wants, whenever he wants. And that's great. But also, we don't know why it's happening (although it seems to have something to do with [[Costi's Sword]]). #mysteries 

## Team Logging
[[Rez|Amy]] and [[Freya|Courtney]] got into their disguises and went to work at [[Pent Logging]]. They are unusually good at woodworking. [[Callgrim Pogleliggle]], their boss, gave them the good advice not to go to the fanciest restaurant on the campus, because apparently it makes people super sick. 

That seemed like as good an excuse as any to be late coming back from their lunch break.

Honestly, a bunch of things happened but the main thing is that they got into [[Norathar Pent]]'s office, which is extremely nice and extremely magical (built in large part of Ghithyarti wood). [[Rez]] who *definitely* knows how to pick locks did a pretty decent job picking some locks, and slipped the [[Operation Incriminating Letters|Incriminating Letter]] into a file cabinet -- and left a clue as to which-folder-it's-in. So, hopefully that's enough. 

They also may have gotten [[Limley]] into some shit with the guards at [[Pent Logging South]]. [[Limley]], who was already suspicious of our woodworking heroes. So perhaps we should not go back there. [[Rez]] and [[Freya]] left a letter and some gold for [[Callgrim Pogleliggle]] as an apology.

## Team PromenAid

[[Costi]], [[Hugh]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] went to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] to pick up the decoy ring from [[Divitston Goldstone]]. It seems like he worked on it all night. That guy is a real sweetie.

From there, we went to the [[Jalantar|Terrivar Fields]], where the event would be taking place! The [[Promenade Aid Society]] was hosting its annual "Puppies and Pie" fundraiser, which is *simply delightful*. [[Costi]] used his new mysterious abilities to disguise himself as a guy named [[Costi|Marius]], who he once knew. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] took on the identity of [[Costi|Marius]]'s made-up cousin Cassie, and [[Hugh]] stripped naked to look like a regular warforged bodyguard.

Speaking of, last night [[Hugh]] noticed something on their arm. It was a black heart, and it made them angry. It was also probably pretty identifiable, having the [[Beating Heart Regiment]] written on it, so we asked [[Hugh]] to carry our coats to cover it.

[[Adrienne Spout|Cassie]] conspicuously bought a *number* of glasses of wine, and seemed to be drinking them with enthusiasm -- so that bumping into [[Norathar Pent]] and enabling [[Costi|Marius]] to steal the ring would seem like a natural chain of events.

[[Costi|Marius]] did equal amounts of asking-people's-opinions about [[Norathar Pent]] and expressing his own admiration. The vibe on her is generally good, although a few folks seemed to have some complicated feelings about [[Pent Logging|Pent Logging]] as a workplace.

[[Hugh]] adopted a possum named [[Maurice]]. Or, rather, [[Costi|Marius]] adopted a possum named [[Maurice]] and handed him to [[Hugh]] to carry. But we all know this is [[Hugh]]'s possum.

After the winner of the pie contest was announced, we got in line to shake the judges' hands. The plan was:
- remove [[Ring of Efreet Summoning|Pent's ring]]
- WHILE bumping into her so that she doesn't notice
- Hide the ring in a **wrist pocket**
- Drop the decoy ring on the ground

Reader, it *worked*. Pent's head of security [[Relakas 1]], seemed to make a mental note of [[Adrienne Spout|Cassie]], but she was also being very sexy about it, so maybe he just wants to call her for drinks. (Alternatively, we have a new problem. It's possible that this isn't the first time someone has been pointedly-sexy to try to distract the head of security. This might in fact be the kind of thing a head of security would know to look out for.)

As we were leaving, a falcon dropped a pouch with the exact amount of gold that we paid for [[Maurice]] the possum. So, another promise from the [[Fire Raisers]] has been fulfilled.

Finally, we all linked back up at [[The Golden Gryffon]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] investigated Pent's ring and discovered it as a [[Ring of Efreet Summoning]]. We don't want to have one of those in our hotel room, so [[Rez]] messaged [[Cinder]] to ask if we could coordinate a drop-off. [[Cinder]] said no - not until we also have the vial from [[Vigo Underswell]]'s office.
