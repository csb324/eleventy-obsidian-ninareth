# Session 25

### The Library
[[Hugh]], [[Costi]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] went to the [[Redscale]] library. It turns out, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] hadn't been paying her alumni dues, but after a small donation to the school fund, she was restored to "good standing" and could get them access to the library.

She also found out that [[Redscale]] is cosponsoring the [[Bellisime]], and she got a bit more information on the events around the concert.

[[Costi]] went looking for information on [[Norathar Pent]] and [[Vigo Underswell]]. [[Norathar Pent]]'s name usually came up with relation to her charity work, specifically with the [[Promenade Aid Society]]. [[Vigo Underswell]] was all over [[The Talon]], doing general public-official blurbs. Nothing spicy, but it might come in handy.

[[Hugh]] went looking for information on recent wars in the [[Southern Cities]]. There's a lot. The [[Southern Cities]] are frequently at war.

### Dinner
We had dinner with [[Giary]]. He didn't want to know about [[Operation Incriminating Letters|anything]] that might undercut the financial success of [[The Stagehands]]. [[Rez]] was able to make him see the value of playing both sides, and he agreed to help us in a few ways. He could ask [[The Stagehands]] for:

- Information on when [[Norathar Pent]] and [[Vigo Underswell]] would be out of their respective offices
- Possibly *moving* when they would be out of their offices to a time that is more convenient for us
- Getting [[The Stagehands]] to look the other way, if something perhaps happened when those people were out of their offices

For a price. So, we agreed that we definitely wanted the information, and we'd let him know about moving the dates if the dates were a problem.

We also learned that the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]] had made [[The Talon]]. It turns out, [[Zalev]] had permission from [[the Mayor of Jalantar]] to arrest *dangerous criminals*, like [[Niko|The Hunter]], but they didn't technically have permission to go around arresting [[Qik|random small-time criminals]]. When dozens of people escaped the [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar|embassy]], officials around [[Jalantar]] (including [[Ellinev Del]]) started asking questions. [[Darfu Zeen]] has been called back to [[Zalev]], and things are generally tense.

### In the morning

[[Giary]] sent us a very obscure message, which let us know two things:
1. [[Vigo Underswell]] would be meeting with [[The Stagehands]] in five days. We asked if he could make that three. We're on a deadline.
2. [[Norathar Pent]] would be in a public setting tomorrow, at 2pm, for a charity event with the [[Promenade Aid Society]]. 

We made plans to meet up with [[Giary]] and publically cry about how deceived we were by our mutual friend [[Niko]]. Who could have suspected that he was a wanted criminal? Not any of us, that's for sure.

We discussed the plan at some length. Since [[Freya]] and [[Rez]] had already made contact with [[Pent Logging North]] [[session-24|yesterday]], we decided the best way to get into [[Norathar Pent]]'s office was for them to *actually get jobs*. So today, their task was to return to the logging camp, no longer projectile vomiting, and get themselves hired.

Meanwhile, while [[Norathar Pent]] is at this society event, [[Costi]] thinks he'll be able to steal the ring we need off her finger with a cool spell he just learned (from a scroll he found at the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]]). [[Hugh]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] will go too. So their plan for the day was to do more research, and to try to find a replacement ring.

### Job interview part 2
[[Rez|Amy]] and [[Freya|Courtney]] put on some mundane disguises and came back to [[Pent Logging North]]! It's a good thing, too, because [[Limley]] had a whole squad of guards investigate them for illusions.

They got another bit of a tour, and then the job was theirs -- the only question was where, specifically, they'd be working. Enter [[Ferro Whipwind]], foreman and boss, who oversaw the contract signing and explained how life at the company works.

The pay structure of this place *sucks*. 1 silver a week, plus 10 Pentcoins. Pentcoins can be used for things like "drinking water during your 12 hour shift" and "literally everything else". But don't worry, you can get payday loans of Pentcoins, and the interest rate is, if I recall correctly, in the neighborhood of 35%.

[[Rez|Amy]] and [[Freya|Courtney]] wound up in warehouse E-4, where they met [[Callgrim Pogleliggle]] who was pretty hostile at first. But our logging heroes impressed him with feats of strength, and he invited them to work in his warehouse. He seems to have some kind of ongoing disagreement with [[Ferro Whipwind]]. Tomorrow is their first day of work!

### Across the city

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Costi]], and [[Hugh]] showed up at [[The Ring Box]] just in time to remember that they didn't actually want to go to [[The Ring Box]]. They realized, just in time, that asking someone you don't know very well to make a replica of a ring that's about to be stolen is probably a bad idea. Especially because they probably couldn't do it in time.

However, asking someone that you *sorta* know is a very good idea. Someone who, perhaps, is pretty down for shenanigans and knows metalworking. Someone like [[Divitston Goldstone]]. 

So they went to a few stores and found some costume jewelry with glass gems approxmiately the right sizes and shapes, then made their way back to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. 

[[Divitston Goldstone]] asked how [[Rez]] was doing! They told him she'd come by soon, but that they needed a favor -- they needed him to make a ring, with these stones, in this configuration. He didn't seem totally sure, until they confessed that the ring was a present for [[Rez]]. She's been having such a hard time since the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in|kidnapping]]. [[Divitston Goldstone|Goldstone]] agreed to do it by tomorrow morning. Thanks, friend!

Meanwhile, [[Hugh]] went to the hearth. [[Carvin]] has started wearing a symbol of [[TrueSilver]], by the way. [[Hugh]] made an offering to the fire ([[Rian]]'s sporty outfit, which I guess the goddess... liked?) and asked her about healing, hurting, and the path they're on. The answer seemed to be a warm one. Seems like [[Hugh]] is on the right track, but the healing is her preference.
