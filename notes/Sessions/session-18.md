# Session 18

We got back to [[The Sheath and Sickle]]; [[Niko]] was not there. After some conversation (and some spying) [[Giary]] finally decided to tell us he was worried (and made [[Innis]] and [[Qik]] leave). He said a little more about the steps he'd be taking to try to track [[Niko]] down, then left his keys on the counter and left the bar. 

[[Freya]] went outside to talk to Uru, who seemed worried about [[Niko]] and hopeful for a snack. Uru told her niko had been going to see someone named Dorik. Petting Uru seemed to help freya calm down as well.

Up in [[Niko]]'s room, we found some very interesting things. This man has a lot of secret compartments. 

One interesting thing was a secret pamphlet that [[Costi]] snatched out of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s hands. It had flames on it, but she didn't get a chance to read the words. It turns out, [[Costi]] is worried about Adrienne feeding sensitive information back to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|somebody]]! [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was salty about this. 

[[Rez]] took the pamphlet and read it, and told [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] it was probably not helpful to find [[Niko]] anyway. 

[[Hugh]] found a metal stag and liked it. [[Hugh]] does not like [[Giary]]. 

Also interesting:
- a beautiful Zalevi bow called Grounder, especially good at knocking folks off their horses. 
- Some arrows that are so explosive that they can burst holes through walls 
- a fancy red quill with an embedded Ruby. It communicates with another ruby, so any message written with the quill is written on paper near the other ruby. Like, perhaps, the one in his bedroom back in tinzelven. 
- Two fake IDs
- A history of arkhosia and a history of mulfara
- A novel 
- Money 

When [[Giary]] got back, we asked more questions about [[Niko]]. It turns out, [[Niko]] is VERY wanted in [[Zalev]]. He's known as "the hunter", and he's "stolen" (read: freed) a huge amount of "property" (read: enslaved zalevis). He might be the reason the whole Zalevi crackdown is happening - he's a big deal to them. 

> Fuck politics, but fuck slavers.

We told [[Giary]] that [[Niko]] was meeting with [[Dorik]], so he followed up on that lead. [[Dorik]] is an elderly gnome who bouncesq around [[The Promenade]], so he's not the easiest to track down. Unclear what Nikos business was with him, but they're known to be friends. 

[[Giary]] also mentioned that [[Rez]], who came into the city under Niko's supervision, would also probably be a target, if the threat we're dealing with is the [[Zalevi Military]]. And things are looking more and more that way. [[Giary]] said he'd try to help [[Rez]] out through [[The Stagehands]], and that [[Niko]] could pay him back after we saved his life. 

We all sort of triggered [[Hugh]] about murders. 

After [[Hugh]] and [[Costi]] went to bed, [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[freya]] discussed having a collective bag of secrets, metaphorically. It's a good idea, but that doesn't mean we trust each other enough to do it. 

We all crashed at [[the sheath and sickle]] after a LONG night. 

The next morning, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] had a conversation with [[Costi]] about how in touch she is with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] (not in touch at all), and sort of soft-launched the trusting-each-other conversations that we are all due for. [[Costi]] seemed open to it, but needs to keep certain secrets anyway. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] didn't disagree. 

[[Costi]] read [[Jecka]]'s necklace - it said "the beauties of shadow", in Sylvan. Weird! Adrienne also identified the diadem, which can cast sending once per day. 

[[Freya]] had to break the bad news to Uru that [[Niko]] wasn't back yet, but promised him soon. [[Rez]] called in sick to [[Dragonsfire Forge|ironworking]].

Then, we hit up the [[Divian wilds]] to meet the birdlovers. [[Srictha]] and Costi had a conversation about their mutual friend [[Niko|Kristoff]]. [[Srictha]] didn't have much to add, but mentioned we should stay in [[The Academy District]] for the next couple days. He also asked about jewelry, which was a *weird question.* 

[[Freya]] talked to [[Klaus (Falcon)]] and his less intelligent bird friends. [[Rez]] talked to some bird lovers. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] played the harp, and something about the forest and the [[Larethian Rose|rose]], which still hasn't wilted, really put her in a good headspace. With [[Hugh]]'s guidance, she tried to ask [[Corellon Larethian]] what he *wanted* from her. The rose blew back to her. 

We left the wilds and went back to [[The Golden Gryffon]], where we had a package of clothes delivered! We made a big deal about being seen at dinner and talking about how drunk we got at the [[The Miscasts|concert]] and how we stayed at [[The Needle Cushion]] for safety because *jeepers* [[the promenade]] is dangerous at night! 

[[Samuel]] did us a favor and checked out our drop point with [[Kara]] (looked normal) and the [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar|Zalevi embassy]] (looked like 60ish guards, which is more than normal, but they weren't acting crazy weird)

Right before going to bed, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sent a message to [[Giary]] using the diadem. She also spent a bit more time with it, and ended up telepathically linked with some [[The Beauties of Shadow|very spooky witch voices]]. On a hunch, she asked if one was Orlie. It seems it was not. it also seems that has given the angry witches more information than they previously had. This was probably not a good move. 

Luckily, [[Hugh]] was in [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s room all night with one eye open. [[Rez]] [[costi]] and [[freya]] all slept in the foyer.

[[Giary]] said to come over in the morning, so we did (first stopping by the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] to break the news that [[Rez]] no longer has time for ironworking and will pay off her debts with money.) 

We came over and Giary let us know that 1) odds are, the [[Zalevi Military|Zalevis]] have [[NIko]] in [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar|the embassy]], 2) [[Giary]] is going in tomorrow, and 3) there was a weird explosion at a Guardian-aligned space in the [[Northern Wing]] this morning. #mysteries 

(Wonder if [[Srictha]] knows anything about that, given that he told us to stay in the academy district. Costi are you laundering money for domestic terrorists or what?)

Then [[Innis]] came in and let us know 4) [[Qik]] was also taken by zalevis. So she's coming with us. [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] is with her! We love that for him. 

We used the diadem again to contact [[Kara]] and tell her to come to [[the sheath and sickle]]. she doesn't trust us but is coming over anyway. 

So. We don't have a plan, but we do have a PLAN, and it's to [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in|go free everyone in the zalevi embassy dungeon]].
