# Session 31: Insert Spiderman meme

We wrapped up dinner with [[The Miscasts]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] mentioned to [[Jenson Davour]] that he should be careful where he gets his drugs, because *[[Vigo Underswell|someone]]* high level was probably going to be getting arrested soon. No reason we should know that.

The next day, [[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] went on a [[Rez Hires an Actor|mysterious errand]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Costi]] went to the [[Burbank FIT]], so Costi could talk to [[Professor Vendorsmere]]. Vendorsmere was a little impressed, but not tremendously impressed. [[Costi]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] got guest permission to use the training rooms, so they trained, a word which here means "One person threw knives at the other person until she was on death's door".

[[Freya]] stayed home to read.

As we were all getting back from our various errands, [[Loomis]] said there was a problem with our payment. But it was a *prank*. [[Vask]] is here, and he brought his friends! You never know what you're gonna get with that guy.

His friends are:
* [[Victoria Several]]
* [[Magister]]
* [[Pik]]
* [[Pak]]

[[Magister]] was very interested in meeting [[Hugh]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tried to warn [[Magister]] about [[Hugh]]'s memory issues, which [[Magister]] did not appreciate. He does not like being condescended to. He doesn't like labels either. He doesn't like a lot of things, but he does like [[Victoria Several]] and her family, so that's who he works with now. By choice.

From the hotel, [[Vask]] insisted on bringing us all to the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Jalantar]]. There, we saw a huge statue of [[Azir DarAxia|Saint Azir Goldborn DarAxia]] and talked about dragons. [[Vask]] and [[Rez]] really like dragons. ([[Hugh]] went to the hearth and discussed having a pot luck)

While we were at the sanctuary, we were told we could not leave! There had been a *number* of [[Mysterious Explosions]], and the whole city was locked down! So we hung out for a bit.

Eventually we were allowed to leave, and we had our midnight rendezvous with [[Srictha]] in the [[Divian Wilds]]. We turned over the [[Sovereign Glue]] and the [[Ring of Efreet Summoning]], and we found out that, in the process of clearing the buildings after those explosions this afternoon, someone found evidence leading to several high profile arrests! How interesting.

*More interesting,* however, was that the [[Fire Raisers]] actually delivered on their promises. They gave [[Freya]] a cool sheild, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] a cool piece of armor, and a book about how to get better at wearing heavier stuff. That's all fine. They said they'd set up some kind of meeting for [[Rez]] at the [[Bellisme Show]]. [[Hugh]] has a possum. And *Costi*.

Costi got to talk to [[Terrav]]. [[Terrav]], who says he knows [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] and has been corresponding with him regularly. The last he heard from [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] was four months ago, and [[Freya]] picked up that perhaps [[Terrav]] wasn't telling us everything. He didn't seem to be lying, but he did seem to be trying not to worry us, in a situation that may be indeed worrying. Point is, *we have more evidence that [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] is alive.*
