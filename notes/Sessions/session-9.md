# session 9: a long day

Back at the [[Laborers Hall]]... 
- [[Hugh]] talked a bit about how much he dislikes death
- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talked to [[Costi]] about mage pong and encouraged him to forgive [[Hugh]].
- [[Gora Klipitz]] arrived, MASSIVE rifle in hand, to say [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] had news for us

We went to [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]'s lab, and made a big deal about enjoying Gora's charcuterie plate. Klipitz showed us his bag that seems to just generate gemstones. He gave us 1 diamond, 2 sapphires, and 2 rubies.

He's not sure they're real though, so he's sending [[Niko]] to [[Jalantar]] to get them looked at (he has many others). He also sold [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] a pearl for identifying things, at way below market value. But uh, earth elementals may come looking for it. So, probably good to replace that soonish. (Adrienne told [[Costi]] they could share the pearl for the identify spell)

From there, we stopped by the [[Wayfinders]] post so [[Freya]] could leave a note. The box isn't magic or anything. We checked.

Next stop: [[Guruden Estate]]. [[Brent]] let us in and gave us something to read for a little while until [[Willen Guruden]] was free. 

When he finally had time for us, he gave us our reward for helping the town!
- 500 gold
- An [[ivory pistol]]
- A [[Gust fan]]
- A potion of Lightning Breath
- a Cloak of Elvenkind

He also let us know the name of a place to stay in Jalantar, on him. [[The Golden Gryffon]]

Then we went shopping! From [[Tack & Trade]], we bought some rations and [[Rez]] inquired again about the [[Ring of Sorrows]]. ([[Costi]] secretly bought the ring and gave it to [[Samuel]]). [[Hugh]] bought a keychain at a reasonable price. [[Abaria]] called [[Hugh]] a hero, which he liked :) At [[Bliken's Forge]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] bought a chain shirt and a small shield.

Finally we went to [[The Thrusting Trumpet]] to relax. 
- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] proposed that the five of them keep working together when they arrived in Jalantar
- [[Victor]] found [[Costi]] and told him about [[Ellinev Del]], a Provider delegate in [[Jalantar]] that Costi might want to meet. He gave him a letter of introduction, *and* [[Victor's Gloves]]. They're very cool gloves.
- [[Willa]] approached [[Hugh]] and thanked him for saving her life. It turns out she's a [[The Wayward Wardens]], which led to a whole conversation about [[Stalwart Mudd]] and  [[The Zumbinis]] ([[Freya]]'s world history knowledge has some pretty significant gaps). 
- [[Niko]] met up with us to talk travel logistics, and [[Hugh]] made it weird.
- [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] discussed [[Costi]]'s image and how to maybe help (step one: ask Hugh to stop putting Costi places)
