# Session 15: witherspoon? we barely know him. 


We arrived at the [[Seven Hooves]]. Hugh and Adrienne went to the bar and talked to the bartender, [[Quarrin Witherspoon]], and chatted about running a gambling establishment. Adrienne mentioned they were possibly looking for work. Meanwhile, [[Rez]],  [[Costi]], and [[Freya]] played five-cup shuffle and lost.

Next, we played Sixes against a young elf named [[Dorian]], and an older halfling named [[Ulia Glorsbade]] who seemed to be both teaching [[Dorian]] how to gamble, but also trying to get money out of him. [[Costi]] lost five gold on purpose. Why? Unclear! But it was weird! To keep things sporting, the halfling gave Costi a bottle of Best Cask Mead -- she just opened a brewery here in jalantar, and is advertising. 

Eventually we ordered some pub food. That's when a faintly green-skinned person approached Adrienne and said he might have a job, if we could talk in the back. So, we went out behind the bar, where we encountered [[Lish]], the bartender from [[Fridian's Favor]].

Lish and his gang were there to extort us, it seems.  We were not interested in being extorted. Apparently [[Fridian's Favor]] was raided by guards almost as soon as we left, so, they're not happy with us. [[Hugh]] immediately cast thamaturgy to call the guards over to us. Combat ensued! [[Freya]] ripped [[Lish]]'s organs out, and [[Costi]] killed one of his friends, but otherwise most of the gang escaped. Guards never actually showed up, to our knowledge.

**Who were they**

- Lish, the orcish guy 
- A redscale student who used a scroll to cast fireball and seemed nervous
- An assassin who ran, IIRC
- A guy who got the giggles
- The green-tinted fellow

As the gang started to flee, [[Quarrin Witherspoon|Witherspoon]] came out with a rifle and asked who the fuck set his bar on fire. We said, not us, and he approached the giggly guy.

> "We wait in the wings" 
> "We run the show."

Witherspoon told us this was unsanctioned and that Lish was a hothead. It turns out, everyone involved is a member of [[The Stagehands]]. 

We talked to [[Quarrin Witherspoon|Witherspoon]] for a bit while we cleaned ourselves up. Adrienne mentioned the [[Zalevi Military]] was involved in the raid at [[Fridian's Favor]], so we really weren't the problem. That seemed to make sense to Witherspoon. Looking to build a relationship, we then offered more information in exchange for some unknown amount of gold. [[Freya]] had the idea to share info on the [[summoning stone]] from the [[Temple of Pelor outside Jalantar]], and [[Quarrin Witherspoon|Witherspoon]] decided that was juicy enough. 

([[Rez]] tried to pocket the gold, with the argument that she's the one who he was physically speaking to at the time. The rest of the party did not agree with this. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] thought it should be split up, but [[Freya]] suggested we keep the 50 gold as party funds. We now have party funds!)

Finally, we went back to [[The Golden Gryffon]], where [[Costi]] made the very noble decision to let everyone into the pillow fort. Inside the pillow fort, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] got drunk and everyone played a [[Wayfinders]] game called **"What the fuck is up is that"**

[[Freya]] let us know a bit more about the origin of the [[Mysterious Circles]], [[Costi]] told us his dad's name, [[Rez]] defended her spending habits, [[Hugh]] revealed that he can't swim, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] insisted that she definitely *has* had friends before, it's just *objectively* weird for people to be nice to you.
