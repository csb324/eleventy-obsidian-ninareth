# Redscale Academy for Music and The Arts

[Location::[[Jalantar]]]

A music conservatory, arts school, and general daycare for the children of the upper classes. Except also night-care, because it's a boarding school. 

They don't teach magic, really. 

*They used to. When students ask, the answer is “it was too dangerous” but that’s definitely not the full story. Only by individual petition were certain spells permitted to be taught. Feather fall for the dancers, for example. Dancing lights. Harmless spells.*

[[Adrienne Spout]] went there, as did [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]].

## History

> In [[Lillith Redscale]]’s hometown of [[Jalantar]], in the mountains of Arkhosia, it was decided that they needed to honor her memory with a school. A school to train young musicians.
> 
> It starts humbly, but the idea of going to a school affiliated with the zumbinis is appealing to a lot of people. So people start sending their children from far away. They build a dorm. And a kitchen. And assign teachers to live with them, to make sure they don’t get homesick. They try to nurture the kids into great artists, musicians, and smart, fearless adults. In Lilith’s honor.
>  
> Over time, things change. These days, Lilith would hate this place. It’s an exclusive institution. An ivory tower of excellence, musical and otherwise. It’s prestigious, isolated, and intensely competitive. Tuition is steep.

100ish years ago, there was a headmistress (Corynn Akhodi) who took the arcane instruction too far. Something went awry. She was removed as headmistress and her legacy was buried. 

### Past Headmasters:

##### [[Antonius Slater-Runehorn]]
Really contributed to the worldwide renown of the school… and the atmosphere of elitism. Placed a lot of emphasis on performing for crowds, and having the students impress world leaders. For networking. He was a storyteller, which helped with the networking.

##### [[Corynn Akhodi]]
Played the bagpipes and was up to some shady shit.

##### [[Durstane Brystewood]]
Immediately after Corynn Akhodi. He oversaw the removal of arcana from the curriculum, for safety reasons.
