# Aurelia Vlaicu Academy of Divination

School, Deal 'Ras

[Location::[[Deal 'Ras]]]

TL;DR

## NPCs

```dataviewjs
const { Campaign } = window.customJS;
Campaign.listNPCs(dv);
```


> Deal ‘Ras is largely built upon the success of the Aurelia Vlaicu Academy of Divination (AVAD), founded about 640 years ago by a former Head Magi of Divination at the Slaavadi College who, disenchanted with the political attitude of the College, left to start her own Academy with a focus on Divination. The Academy grounds are one of the few parts of the [[Southern Cities]] where slavery is not permitted. This rule does not extend to the rest of Deal ‘Ras or to Jezeten. It is a poorly kept secret that AVAD attracts political malcontents, and is the primary gathering place for those interested in serious reform to Eberron’s government. It is also heavily monitored by Dharinov and Luthei’s agents. Basically everyone knows everyone is up to something, but no one is willing to make the largely intel based war a hot one.

Slavery isn't allowed

[[Costi]] went there. Maybe still goes there?

They play Mage Pong.
