### Dharinov Duchy

There are two cities, each relatively close to one another, that serve as the seat of power for Duchess v’Dharinov. They were unified about 280 years ago, to provide additional protection from Frendrion the Hellrainer. These are the political capital of Jezeten and cultural capital of Deal ‘Ras. On maps, they are often lumped together; the choice of which name is used is often a political one.  Deal ‘Ras is largely built upon the success of the Aurelia Vlaicu Academy of Divination (AVAD), founded about 640 years ago by a former Head Magi of Divination at the Slaavadi College who, disenchanted with the political attitude of the College, left to start her own Academy with a focus on Divination. The Academy grounds are one of the few parts of the Southern Cities where slavery is not permitted. This rule does not extend to the rest of Deal ‘Ras or to Jezeten. It is a poorly kept secret that AVAD attracts political malcontents, and is the primary gathering place for those interested in serious reform to Eberron’s government. It is also heavily monitored by Dharinov and Luthei’s agents. Basically everyone knows everyone is up to something, but no one is willing to make the largely intel based war a hot one. The ELA is based out of Dharinov.
