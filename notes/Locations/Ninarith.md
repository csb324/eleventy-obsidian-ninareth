# The World

![](/assets/obsidian/world.jpg)

It is the year 3451, exactly 350 years since the Second Sundering.

# Regions:

### [[Major Nations]]
> In the north, the three great kingdoms continue to serve as the primary economic powerhouses of the continent. [[Taleem]]'s navy patrols the seas, and their farms keep the world fed under the generally benevolent rulership of the Viraxes family. The elves of [[Dilandil]] guard and nurture the [[Liveth forest]], keeping close watch on the lines between the Feywild and the Prime Material. And the dwarves of [[K'falgaard]] have expanded out of their ancestral home in the towering Ragndaar Mountains, establishing a home in [[Zilvengrod]] in the south.

### [[Narathian Plains]] 
> Further south, [[Thelran Asari]] continues to dominate the world’s political structure from its seat in the center of the rolling hills of the Narathian Planes. The extensive support they received after [[the Three Dragons War]], not to mention the extensive international clout they could throw around because of their deep connection to most of [[The Zumbinis|that war’s heroes]], established the city as a hub of diplomatic power they have been reluctant to let go. 

### [[Southern Cities]]
> In the Southern Cities, life continues as it always has ... They’re all still always at war, squabbling over this, or that, or the other thing.

### [[Turian Waste]]
> The Turian Wastes, for so long an ugly and painful blemish on the continent’s face, have in the last two centuries begun to recede. It’s happened slowly, in fits and starts, but the deadly winds and harsh cracks and divots in the earth have begun to pull back.

### [[Deregheir]]
> As the [[Turian Waste|Wastes]] have retreated, civilization has stepped in. The Wanderers, left without a Waste to Wander, found a new purpose. After [[the Three Dragons War]], they, along with volunteers from the allied armies, established the outpost of [[Antaourth]] to watch and monitor the retreat the of the Wastes. Others joined them, and together they have turned the dead land into a new nation, [[Deregheir]], dedicated to keeping [[Tiamat]]’s forces where they belong.

### [[The Tendrils]]
> To the east, the cities of [[the Tendrils]] continue their never ending quest to stamp out the pirate menace that plagues their coasts, keeping commercial traffic on the east coast afloat if not always perfectly safe.

### [[Tinkate]]
> The desert city-state of [[Tinkate]], historically isolated and withdrawn from the affairs of the rest of the continent, has further withdrawn into itself since the Second Sundering. While travelers are sometimes welcome to partake of the vibrant markets lining the city's streets, much of the goings on in Tinkante remain a mystery.

### [[True North]]
Well, one can assume it's cold.

# Urbanization

Immediately after the Second Sundering, the world was broken. Many tried to number the dead, and most agree that even the most liberal estimates are on the lower side. Even though the dragons were beaten, they weren’t broken. It took decades for the attacks to truly cease. In the meantime, the thousand thousand tiny towns, hamlets, and whatever name a group of three houses clustered together called themselves decided to give city life a try.

Life has moved to major settlements. Pastoral folks flocked almost universally, from every place on the continent, to places with walls. And the cities ballooned. Most were scarcely prepared to take in so many stragglers, but they made do. The fact that there were now a great deal of vacant houses didn’t hurt, either.

Eventually, people remembered that living in squalid conditions in overcrowded slums was not ideal. And so they began to set out into the wilds. Over the last three hundred years, the wilds re-earned their name. Initial settlers realized too late that it was no longer safe to live weeks away from the nearest major settlement. So instead of being a few weeks away from large cities, they settled for being maybe a few days out instead.
