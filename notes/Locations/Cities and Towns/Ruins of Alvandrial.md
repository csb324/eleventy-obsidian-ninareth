# Alvandrial
Ruined City, [Location::[[Dilandil]]]

A city that was destroyed in [[The Three Dragons War]]. Or was it? Did that war (the one against [[Taleem]]) have a different name? 

Anyway. The city was destroyed one way or another. 

It is now very spooky over there. 

Nearby, [[Thelforiel]] sprung up in its absence.
