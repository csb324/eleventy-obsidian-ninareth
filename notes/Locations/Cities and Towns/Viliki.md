# Viliki
Town, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Eberron]]</span></span>

A newer settlement, about 46 years old, with a population of about 10,000 people. It's about a weeks travel outside [[Jezeten]]. 

Northern [[Nushkev]] is a few days away from the [[Burbank Compound]] by walking. It's under [[Baron Pendaras Nushkev]]'s protection, who known as an absentee baron and rules very lightly. The [[Burbanks]] have filled the void, and are essentially in charge. The [[Eberronian Second Division]] tends to be the dominate force wherever it goes.

There's a small wall around the town, with a break in the walls overlooking the bay, and a giant fountain in the center of [[Fendridad Square]]. A path cut into the stone goes up the mountain, with a large mansion 500 feet up, for [[Baron Pendaras Nushkev]]. We and the [[Mayor Galfeedz Drakurshire]] have offices in the [[Ratoucha]], which he says is essentially a town hall in [[Eberron]].
