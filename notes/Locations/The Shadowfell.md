# The Shadowfell
Plane

One of the [[Planes of existence]]. We’ve seen evidence of it a few times now…
- at the overrun [[Zhakastin Expedition]], we found sorrowsworn in the larder. ([[Notes-144]]). We then discovered that 
- nearby, we found a whole portal, created by [[Kaycee Teapetal|Rez's Mom]] for her best friend [[Mr. Blueberry]]. She moved it. 
- Inside the [[Heal the Anchor Tree|anchor tree]] where [[G'zraad]]  was operating, there was also a [[Hungry]].

Apparently, there’s some drama going on down there! Specifically, in [[The City of Endless Night]]. There’s a new sheriff in town, or something? [[Zormvrik]] seemed to identify as a refugee/exile. [[Notes-145]]


[[The Raven Queen]] also resides in the shadowfell.
