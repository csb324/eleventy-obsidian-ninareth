# Home
A mysterious, newly discovered island nation off the coast of mainland [[Ninarith]]. It's about a month's travel by sea below the southern islands.

Those that lived there didn't know anywhere else existed. Turns out it was a bit of a cult in general, and now there are continental powers who are talking about renaming it. 

It was a magical utopia for about 17,000 (!!) years, before recorded history. That was happening because they were pulling magic from all the rest of the world. Without all of that magic, things deteriorated quickly after that.

Most homelanders will be making their way mainland, as it's gotten pretty bad there.

### Ties to [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]] 
[[Samson]] tells us about the two people who were pretending to be gods: [[Gosar]] and [[Elgen]]. The captured the magic over [[Home]] with a powerful enchanted dome, it consolidated the weave so magic was limitless and enhanced. The dome then gained consciousness, named [[Kaloren]], and wanted to teleport off the [[Prime Material]]. There was a void surrounding them that had multiple tears, bringing creatures and items from multiple [[Planes of existence]]. 

[[Kaloren]] wrote the letter to [[Sezathkathon]], which had the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]. 

[[Kaloren's Letter to Sezathkathon]]:
	[[Kaloren]] -
	I'm so thrilled to hear that our suggestions helped bridge your most recent research blockage. We have found that a willing participant serves as a much more effective conduit for the Derival Plinth's energy; a thrall serves in a pinch, but you waste so much effort forcing them to assist you. Having them volunteer leads to less spillage. This should mean you're close to making your next attempt, correct? Do you have a date set? We'd like to watch the skies to ensure we can follow your ongoing efforts, even from half a world away! Additionally, I wanted to let you know that your advice has once again born fruit. An indirect approach, while somewhat wasteful (it seems waste of magical energy is becoming a theme of this message!) has allowed us to circumvent her quite significant barriers, and we are making excellent progress. Barring any significant delays, I suspect we'll have finalized crystals--improved upon the most recent batch we sent you--within the month! Good luck with your ascension, and I hope to have followers in your name leading prayer groups in our camps soon. 
	As Ever, Under the Eye, Your Friend [[Sezathkathon]]

### [[There's Plainly Something Wrong with the Planes]]
[[Samson]] tells us about his magical divorce making him powerless, until he picked up a sword and fell into a lake with a [[Kraken]] who wanted to come to the [[Prime Material]], and needed help, in exchange giving [[Samson]] power. We get a whole scoop about his ex [[Rill]] and her new wife [[Vani]] and the messy messy implosion of his last marriage. 

Once he got here he realized the [[Kraken]] was going to hurt a lot of people, wanted to come into [[Yent Lake]] - he lost his power, again. He's in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] but is pretty upset with [[Samson]] and will likely be sending folks after him. 

After that, he was laying in bed and saw a woman (read: a devil formerly know as [[Gemma]]) in a very hot room with butterfly wings, who said something like, "[[Samson]] you're involved in things bigger than you join me and I'll help you kill [[Sezathkathon]]". He's part of the [[Cult of the Butterfly Queen]]. She was very helpful with scoping out the [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]].

[[Samson]]'s realized he's a good window for powerful beings. We wonder if [[Samson]] is a [[Synchrona]]. He says he can ask [[Gosar]] and [[Elgen]] if they've heard of this. We decide it's too big of a risk. [[Eirian]] notes how the concentration of the Weave seemed to tie into the planar overlap. 

### Expeditions and Exploration
An airship expedition has already gone, captained by [[Bigseeker]]. News of [[Home]] is spreading. [[Eirian|E]] knows some from folks from [[Durmask]] and [[Ru'Nileth]] have sent folks too. 

[[Trisha]] has expressed interest in leading an expedition.
