## Economy

Largely agrarian, but that's changed in the last few hundred years

Leading in industrialization
- Guns
- Steamships
- Airships
- Warforged

Very secretive / authoritarian
Major income/wealth inequality. Serfs in factories. Probably doesn't work as well as agrarian serfs, huh.
 
(Still some farming, but they also import food from [[Taleem]])

## Culture
The focus of all life and teaching is on how to better Eberronâ€™s future. Incredibly insular. 

> More nefarious, there are rumors--many backed up by evidence--that Eberronian royalty engage in some pretty horrific magics. Blood magic, forced necromancy, bodily dominance; you name it, there are stories about Eberron doing it.


## The Duchies of Eberron

> Eberron is divided into three distinct duchies. Each is in theory as powerful as the other, but the Luthei region is for all intents and purposes the dominant one, and the Duke v'Luthei functionally rules the whole nation. There is a Duke of each, and while they exercise power over their duchy, they bow to the Duke v'Luthei. Typically, a titled noble is referred to by their title, not their birthname. For most, use of their birthname is an insult, and many keep it closely guarded.

**[[Dharinov Region]]**
**[[Bihor Region]]**

## Political Opposition

> In the last century, a concerted effort has arisen to make some serious changes to the political structure of the duchies.
