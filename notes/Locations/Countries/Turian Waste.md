# Turian Waste
Country, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Ninarith]]</span></span>

A massive foreboding desert. Once the site of a great high-elven society, then the site of a great calamity, then the site of [[Lillith Redscale|another great calamity]]. Home to monsters and other things that shouldn't be on the [[Material Plane]].

> The Turian Wastes, for so long an ugly and painful blemish on the continent’s face, have in the last two centuries begun to recede. It’s happened slowly, in fits and starts, but the deadly winds and harsh cracks and divots in the earth have begun to pull back. The broken ruins of the ancient city of [[Gu’athrithen]] remains off limits to most of the world, and it is widely believed to have been rehabilitated by the survivors of [[Tiamat]]’s armies.

As the Wastes have retreated, civilization has stepped in -- calling their new nation [[Deregheir]].
