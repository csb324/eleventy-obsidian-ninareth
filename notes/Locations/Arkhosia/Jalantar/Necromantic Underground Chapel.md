Place, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Jalantar Sewers]]</span></span>

![](/assets/obsidian/NUC.jpeg)

Stained glass window room, with strong sense of death. A decaying corpse is strapped to a St. Andrews Cross in the middle of the room. The corpse seems to have been there for the better part of a year. It seems to have some kind of discoloration on it’s left wrist, and a bit of an indentation behind the left eye like it was impaled. 

Each window has soft blue light depicting a figure floating through spaces: 

*Left* (long raven hair and pale, bathed in a line of black light, looking up and clearly ascending. Below her are tips of fingers) -- the Raven Queen, the last mortal to ascend to godhood. One of the gods of death, a figure of heavy folklore and myth

*Middle* (skeletal figure in right profile with sunken face, fluttery jet black robes with a staff in it’s right hand, looking up) some sort of powerful undead creature, infer also ascended. We’ve heard of a lich, seems to ring that bell. [[Magister]] tells us it's of [[Vecna]].  

*Right* pointed ear figure elven, lowered than the other figures but still elevated. Above a swirling mass of purples that seem to project the figure upwards, with a pronounced ring. Could be [[Morthos]]?
