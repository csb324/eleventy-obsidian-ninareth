# Divian Wilds
District, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Jalantar]]</span></span>

A huge park in the city of [[Jalantar]], between [[The Academy District]] and [[The Fallsides]]. 

Near a statue of a green dragonborn, the bird enthusiasts from [[The Black Gull]] get together and let their birds do bird things.

Representatives from [[Corellon's Grove]] hold hunts in the Divian Wilds, as a form of worship or communion or some such. They're also raising money to make the park more "inhabited".
