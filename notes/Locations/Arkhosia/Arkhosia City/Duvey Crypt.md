# Duvey Crypt
[Location:[[Arkhosia (City)]]]
[Location:[[Halls of the Dead]]
### What is it?
A crypt for the [[Duvey Family]], in the [[Halls of the Dead]]. 

[[Jade]] heard a rumor, of the Duveys, they are involved in international item shipping, and they're up to some shady shit. She's heard people talking about them similarly to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. 

### Why do we care?
[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] was sent to investigate for the [[The Raven Queen]] order within the [[Halls of the Dead]], searching for [[Raven's Edge]]s and news of their missing acolytes. 

We were also searching for the [[Mirror of Life Trapping]] and the [[The Gaze Grafter]] for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. Those were with [[Sheske Eeping]]'s crypt. 

Had some lingering dunamantic time-shift magic. We got caught in the process and looped through several timelines of the crypt. 

It lead to the [[Halls of the Dead Necromantic Chapel]], which included the [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]], [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]], and had several tortured goblins powering it's magic.

### Duveys In It
There's a small plaque, it says, "[[B. Duvey.]] 3369"

 "[[R. Duvey]] 3284". On the center of the table there is a fine plate engraved, "[[Z. Duvey]] 3336".  The cabinets are full of food and trinkets, with three other plaques not put on anything yet, [[K. Duvey]], [[J. Duvey]], and [[W. Duvey]]" but no dates listed.
 
### Other Findings

While investigating the bookshelves further, they pull out a novel that's been popular for a couple hundred years, and behind it we see a sheet of paper. It looks like older than everything else in the room, [[Jade]]'s glasses flash ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]), and unlike everything else in the room it does not seem maintained. It appears blank. It pings now on [[Costi]]'s detect magic, of illusion magic, the books in front of it were backed with lead. [[Jade]] tries to see through an illusion, but it doesn't ping. We get [[Costi]] to start to identify it. Before that, he tries to walk around sensing the dead spots, but the magic is too pervasive for him to catch a beat. His paper did not read magical, but it has illusion magic. There is nothing hidden on it though, so we're not sure how it connects. [[Hugh]] tries to draw on it, and a normal line appears. *JOE NOTE - 70-75*

There are several larders that are chilled filled with food, there are the most perfect olives ever.
