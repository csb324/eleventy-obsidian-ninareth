# Halls of the Dead
Place, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Arkhosia (City)]]</span></span>

Entrance is free, many embark on pilgrimage here as it's one of the only places dedicated to the gods of death: [[Kelemvor]] (peacefulness, nothingness, and rest), [[Loviatar]] (god of tormernt and pain), and one to [[The Raven Queen]] (the moment of death, and the last mortal to achieve ascension in the age of gods.  Hates anything that messes with the sanctity of life).This area makes up an extremely small portion of the area. 

If you have an ancestral connection to a tomb, you can make a yearly payment you can visit them, or through a generous donation you can visit whoever you want. You're paid to be taken to a specific place. It's very guarded and solem. Sometimes has student groups go through, but it is secret in layout. 

Operates through a lift similiar to the on in use at the [[Chapel of the Lost]], with a row of buttons: it goes up to 12, and down to 50. Runs through a key
 * On the 7th floor, there seems to be desk outside
 
Employs death workers who move with caskets, who have a uniform of ash grab robes.

Requires a hefty donation to go and visit specific gravesites, however the lobby is open to all.
