# Gorva's Observatory
Government building, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[The Fallsides]]</span></span>

It's a government building. 100 foot light house looking strucutre, with landing pads circling up towards a large platform at the top with a large crystal, but right into the water. The second-tallest building in [[Jalantar]], shaped like a lighthouse with a glowing crystal at the top. (The crystal has something to do with the city's defenses.)

Top three gov buildings in the city, main airship landing post and heaquarters of the [Eyes of Jalantar] (the information appartus of the government), as well as main hub for civil engineers. Tied to the protection of the city in an unspecified way. 

Heavily guarded. Need badges to walk around.
