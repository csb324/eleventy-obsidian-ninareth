# Fridian's Favor
Tavern, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[The Academy District]]</span></span>

A slightly-off-campus tavern in [[The Academy District]]. It's nice, and performing there is a bit of a rite of passage for [[Redscale]] students.

Turns out, it's also a safe haven for [[The Stagehands|criminal types]], but ~~the [[Lish|bartender]] can be paid off~~. Or, he could, before he tried to extort us and we killed him. It turns out, the whole place was raided by the [[Jalantan Guard]] shortly after we left, and we were imagined to be involved somehow.
