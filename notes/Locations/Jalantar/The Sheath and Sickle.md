# The Sheath and Sickle
Tavern, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[The Promenade]]</span></span>

A dive bar in [[Jalantar]]. It's sticky. Owned by [[Niko]]'s friend [[Giary]].

Affiliated with [[The Stagehands]].

There's a silenced booth in the corner for private conversations. This seems like a very useful feature.

This place has so much character. Like, an almost excessive amount of character. The beer is not very good. [[Giary]] is so proud of this place.

The bar is performance art. per [[Giary]].
