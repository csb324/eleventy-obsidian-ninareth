# The Golden Gryffon
Hotel, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[The Academy District]]</span></span>

[[Willen Guruden]] has promised to pay for our stay, as long as we don't stay too long and embarrass him. Apparently it's a big [[The Guardians|Guardian party]] hangout. The dinner menu is prix fixe, and the concierge, [[Loomis]], seems like a nice fellow.
