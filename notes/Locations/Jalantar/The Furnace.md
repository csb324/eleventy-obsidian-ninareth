The headquarters of the [[Fire Raisers]], buried deep under [[Jalantar]] in the [[Jalantar Sewers]]

The entrance is hidden behind an illusory stone wall. But inside, there's a large red banner, with lack flames along the bottom, and gray ash rising up to form into the shape of a phoenix. When we arrived for the first time, we saw at least sixty people, but only three have been allowed to speak to us so far.

Everyone down here has terrible haircuts.
