# The Pirate Queen
Place, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[The Publics]]</span></span>

A massive theater (really a complex of theaters) in [[The Publics]] of [[Jalantar]]. 

Surrounded by a small moat that's accessible by paddle-boat (and many footbridges), It's shaped like a sinking ship, with a bust of [[Lillith Redscale]] on the bow. The ship has five distinct decks, each containing its own theater (and with its own crow's nest)
