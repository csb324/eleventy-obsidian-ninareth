# Kalikar's Bistro
Place, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Jalantar]]</span></span>

A very fine restaurant. [[Jenson Davour]] invited us there. [[The Curator]] was in a shadowy room with a one-way mirror wall. So, one would think this place is in on it.
