# Pent Logging North
District, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Jalantar]]</span></span> [Location::[[The Promenade]]

Eventually reach an area of the city with 18ft tall black iron fences on either side of the road for the whole block. Each mill is the size of a city block. 

Thick cables about 40 feet above the ground connect the furthest points of both the north and south properties, ferrying large wooden platforms (about 35x20). 

There are gates on either side, entering in the mills, each with 3 private guards all wearing black and green. Everyone traveling in and out are generally wearing dark clothes. Heavily guarded, around 60 guards between the two compounds and at least 100 employees. 

Seems to want workers to stay on campus, workers can apply and live in on campus housing, also have pubs, shops.
