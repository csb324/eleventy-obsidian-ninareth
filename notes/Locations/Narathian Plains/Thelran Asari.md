# Thelran Asari
City, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Narathian Plains]]</span></span>

> Thelran Asari continues to dominate the world’s political structure from its seat in the center of the rolling hills of the Narathian Planes. The extensive support they received after [[the Three Dragons War]], not to mention the extensive international clout they could throw around because of their deep connection to most of [[The Zumbinis|that war’s heroes]], established the city as a hub of diplomatic power they have been reluctant to let go.
