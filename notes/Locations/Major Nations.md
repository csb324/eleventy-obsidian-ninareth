# Major Nations

>  In the north, the three great kingdoms continue to serve as the primary economic powerhouses of the continent. [[Taleem]]'s navy patrols the seas, and their farms keep the world fed under the generally benevolent rulership of the Viraxes family. The elves of [[Dilandil]] guard and nurture the [[Liveth forest]], keeping close watch on the lines between the Feywild and the Prime Material. And the dwarves of [[K'falgaard]] have expanded out of their ancestral home in the towering Ragndaar Mountains, establishing a home in [[Zilvengrod]] in the south.
