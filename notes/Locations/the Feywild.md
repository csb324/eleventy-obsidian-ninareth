# The Feywild
Plane

Here's what we know about the Feywild:

It has similar vibes to the [[Vrolbekk Forest]] and the [[Liveth forest]]. Most things (including vines and fish) seem to speak Sylvan. The sky is in a beautiful perpetual twilight. 

One of the mirror planes -- the counterpart to [[The Shadowfell]].
