# The Tiamat House (A.K.A. Vask's House)
Place, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Jalantar]]</span></span>

Former home of [[Burru Ilp]]

## What it was like wen we found it
A nice estate in the [[The Fallsides]].  Themed in five chromatic colors: Ruby, Emerald, White Crystal, Onxy, and Sapphire. The gate is a dragon heads. The house is filled with rotting food, and is totally trashed. 

We look around, most of the walls have tapestries of major moments of dragon history: the battle of the fork from the first sundering, the battle of [[Guâ€™athrithen]] from the second sundering, [[Galaphanel]]'s flight from [[Durmask]] (behind which is a door), one depciting where [[Tiamat]] is being held, [[Bahamat]]'s asecension, one titled "boulder making" (two paneled a silver dragon surrounded by dwarves, and then those dwarves cheering around a boulder). Has a four volume titled "the second sundering", by the foremost expert on the second sundering -- [[Caleb DarAxia]]. Another small one depicting Kaycee riding a dragon.

On the ceiling is a major fresco, 60 ft panel 40t ft up, of [[Tiamat]] fighting [[Bahamat]].  Anything of value aside from the art is gone. All the metal and shiny things are gone. There are some gouged marks from what might be claws in the wood, like large wyrmling or very young adult but only seems one sided (on the right).

A hidden basement inside, a very large half-orc named Squawnk, around 8.5" tall with a left arm swollen and wrapped in a bandage. A club is on their back, modulated with glass and nails through it. A workshop is in the center of the space, it seems to be a forge (a silver dragonborn is inside).

A statue of a small red and blue dragon, but seems to be made of real scales -- patches have been torn off. A halfling, named Cortis, is strapped to a table who's been a long time member of their cult but now is begging not to have the procedure.
