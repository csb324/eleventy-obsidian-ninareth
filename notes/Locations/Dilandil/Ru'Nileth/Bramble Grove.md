# Brambles Grove
Place, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[The Brambles]]</span></span>

A small temple of [[Corellon Larethian]] in a poorer neighborhood of[[Ru'Nileth]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] played the harp here as a child.

[[Dalyor Torlana]] works here, and has for a long time. She remembers [[Willow]], who was then going by Davi. 

[[Costi]] and [[Rez]] left a significant donation.
