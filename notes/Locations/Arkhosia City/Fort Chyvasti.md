# Fort Chyvasti
[Location:[[Arkhosia]]]


A collection of ruins open to the air on the road between [[Jalantar]] and [[Arkhosia (City)]]. The ceilings are blasted open, with large chunks of rock in a several hundred foot radius. 

### Background
Used to be a military outpost before cities were consolidated becfore [[The Three Dragons War]], but seems to have been targeted in the attacks and has been ruins ever since. It was the site of a horrific slaughter of more than 700 soliders were burned alive during the [[sundering]]. 

### Layout
There's a large watchtower that is still standing, dispite holes throughout it's structure. Inside seems to mostly be birds and their nests.

The ground floor and main visible area has been thoroughly picked over throughout the years.

Hidden tunnels underneath are extensive. 

### Notes
Were told by [[Winifey]] that this serves as a [[Fire Raisers]] waypoint. Heavily trapped in the tunnels underneath the structure.
