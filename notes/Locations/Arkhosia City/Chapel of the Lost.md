# The Chapel of the Lost
Inn, <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">Location</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[Arkhosia (City)]]</span></span>

A luxury hotel, converted from a chapel to one of the true gods (k something). It's a massive glass pyramid in the [[Death halls]]. It has a gym.

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] is staying in the penthouse. He's paying for [[The Unforged Few]] to stay as well.
