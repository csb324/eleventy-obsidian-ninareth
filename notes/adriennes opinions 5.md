[[Costi]]: dope magic missiles, kid. And he handled himself at lunch with guruden. Maybe not the worst liability.

[[Samuel]]: Hugh thinks he's Costis dad but Adrienne thinks Samuel is costi's dad. She does not care for it when he is on her head. get off. 

[[Hugh]]: won't kill a [[Gruung]] -- troubling. his pacifism is worth keeping an eye on, but still: having an indestructible healer around is a good thing. Also he thinks it's fun to practice with the forks!! and this is charming. 

[[Freya]]: GRUUNGSLAYER. adriennes plan with freya at the moment is to hype her up. She doesn't seem like she's gotten a lot of hype in her life, and she's not thirsty for it but that's kind of why it could be effective. 

Making a big deal about being freyas biggest fan -> 
- loyalty
- a more empowered freya (which Adrienne thinks we need, to hold off the forces of impulsive pacifism)

[[Rez]]: we are sisters in fealty to the gruung! Whenever Adrienne is talking shit about "these people", make sure Rez feels like Adrienne means the others.
