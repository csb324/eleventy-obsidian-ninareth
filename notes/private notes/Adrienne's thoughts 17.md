TO DO LIST:
- buy lockbox
- visit vendorsmere 
- talk to Rez about her mom 
- find juliette and ask if those other girls (and jecka) are really redscale students at all

Jensen asked around and found out about Adrienne. calls Julian "S R" 

### the rose 

the rose is staying with Adrienne because corellon wanted her to have it?????? That's. that's bananas. that's like... 
Brain breaking 
like, WHY??

if you want me to do something, tell me what it is 

go to the grove, ask about whether fig has replied, and ask what the hell corellon wants from me. 

"hi. I need to talk to someone." she wishes she could talk to fig. 

she does really like the rose. but why is it LOOKING at her???

### On the party 

**I feel like tonight was a turning point for our group**

**feelings on Rez:** 
DEAD MOM!!! OOHHHH. okay. something is under this. she's been sad before. she's defending something. 
it's a weird amount of "never brought it up before" and "answers immediately when asked" that is so vulnerable. 
plus she actually poured the knives. 
and the miscasts are a surprisingly good band. 
anyway, I kept her up in the fight because I didn't want the fun night ruined. and I don't trust giary, so, yeah I'll burn his bar to the ground if Rez doesn't get back safe. 

**feelings on Hugh:**
oh good, it's starting to get easier to remember. maybe we can find Costi's dad sooner. 
hope he's doing okay though.

**feelings on freya:** 
really went for it on mirror-costi. 
wow she is not doing well huh. She is deeply rattled. 
Okay, hey, feathers! that's pretty good.
conspiratorial friend. 

**feelings on costi:** 
oh you sweet child. your dad is almost for sure dead. but given that rez's mom is for sure dead, must be careful with the phrasing.

### on the topic of the witch 

does Jensen have enemies he's worried about? might have been a band sabotage attempt. 

Costi will read the dogtag, Adrienne will identify the diadem.

### what a tangled web we weave 

next time costi goes to vendorsmere, Adrienne should go too and say hi. just to get that out there. so he knows she knows. like... dibs. 

it would be good for the forces against costi, if they thought Julian was involved already. like, "we don't need to worry about this, someone is on it". SR is involved, so *don't* interfere. 

for Adrienne the name of the game is LET PEOPLE THINK WHAT THEY THINK, and LEAN INTO IT. if they want obsequious they get obsequious. If they expect bitch, they get bitch. if they expect loyal to jsr, they get that. If they wish she weren't, she'll say she isn't. (She isn't. but they'd be right to wonder if she's telling the truth)

### How she does ~seductive~ 

big across the room eye contact 
warm and friendly laugh, talking to other people

"I was wondering when you'd come talk to me"
OR, if they've noticed the eye contact and seem interested but aren't coming over...
"okay, you win. I'm Adrienne. do you want to buy me a drink or do I just have something in my teeth"
