BEFORE WE START GAMBLING HOLY SHIT


**ADRIENNE'S THOUGHTS ON GAMBLING**
- never expect to win
- the person who proposes the bet expects to win
- that's why they proposed it
- only gamble if you'd be happy to lose
- and right now, i need cash, so, probably not gonna gamble 

speaking of, we need to find a job



**what did the harp in the grove mean to adrienne**

this is confirmation: there's some kind of connection here, and it's an unfamiliar feeling. but at least she knows corellon isn't just fucking with her for fun. she didn't misread things.

on some level, **she wanted a sign**. because without a sign, is this a totally selfish choice, to say, oh, actually i'm just doing this thing i love because a *god* wants me to? is that delusional? or self-serving, like when you give someone a gift you know they'll hate because you want to borrow it? 

today in the grove made it feel less like that. 

plus, in other ways, **adrienne doesn't want a sign**. Adrienne isn't a person who waits around for signs. she doesn't want to be led by mysterious coincidences.

she wants to make her own choices. She doesn't want to just do things because she stumbled into them. that's happened enough times (including in tinzelven, to be honest -- but now, traveling with the group is a choice). she wants to do things because she's making a *decision*, because every time she's failed to consider her options and the outcomes, she's suffered for it.

but, especially in this kind of situation, she wants to know that it's a reciprocated choice. if she's choosing corellon, she has to be sure corellon is interested. she DOES NOT want to be rejected. 

so, the sign is less "come over here and hang out" and more "i see the choice you're making, and i welcome it." and that's how she's interpreting the rose, if she's interpreting it. 

**what did the latharian rose mean to adrienne**

re: the *note*, red flag red flag red flag what do they want, that's very nice, but, who did this and what do they want?? 

a major fear of adrienne's: being taken advantage of, especially without her knowledge. 

the rose itself is very nice though and she does like it. and she can hold onto the possibility that perhaps, although the note was put there by someone who she doesn't trust, these flowers don't just come along every day. the flower is, maybe, an answer to her question.

**there is some real tension between vibing it out and making deliberate choices**

adrienne HAS been micro-deliberate, macro-vibes. she has made a choice to be macro-deliberate. but perhaps she also needs micro-vibes.
