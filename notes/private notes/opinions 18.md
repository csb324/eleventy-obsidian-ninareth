if I can get nikos trust, THERES my army. but he wants to probably fuck Julian up. whereas I see that as my least favorite plan. 

but he doesn't trust me. and he's actively talking shit about me to the people I need to trust me. and that's a problem. but I don't have time to be  mad about that. it's fucked up but calling him out gets me nowhere. 

anyway, saving his life should fuckin help. 

and meanwhile, time to undermine niko to costi slightly. just to keep costi on my team. but also, I'm not super worried about that because by the time I need Costi's help, it should be obvious I'm not helping Julian (oh, unless Julian wants to take away something I value, which would be the relationships) (ok, yes, getting Costi's trust matters)

but ALSO convince giary that I have big feelings about niko? nah. convince him I have small secret feelings for niko. **ask in a *sad* way if niko has said *anything* good about me** (Im about to risk my life for him, and I just want to know...) so that it sounds like my feelings are hurt.
