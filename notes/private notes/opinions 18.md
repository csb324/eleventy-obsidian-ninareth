if I can get nikos trust, THERES my army. but he wants to probably fuck Julian up. whereas I see that as my least favorite plan. 

but he doesn't trust me. and he's actively talking shit about me to the people I need to trust me. and that's a problem. but I don't have time to be  mad about that. it's fucked up but calling him out gets me nowhere. 

anyway, saving his life should fuckin help. 

and meanwhile, time to undermine niko to costi slightly. just to keep costi on my team. but also, I'm not super worried about that because by the time I need Costi's help, it should be obvious I'm not helping Julian (oh, unless Julian wants to take away something I value, which would be the relationships) (ok, yes, getting Costi's trust matters) LOL WRONG

but ALSO convince giary that I have big feelings about niko? nah. convince him I have small secret feelings for niko. **ask in a *sad* way if niko has said *anything* good about me** (Im about to risk my life for him, and I just want to know...) so that it sounds like my feelings are hurt.

meanwhile, who in jalantar is authorizing these arrests?

Connor alsidian might know. plant suspicion. "Mister slater runehorn was unable to come himself, but he needs to know -- sorry, it was important to him that I get this part verbatim -- what in the nine hells is going on in your city and don't bullshit me connor."

(might also be a good way to find out what the jalantan guard thinks about the zalevis and who attacked the embassy)

(WITH QUILL WRITE IN CODE. WRITE NONSENSE. so if it's at nikos house, nothing happens)

and then, "i won't hear back from him until tomorrow at the earliest -- unfortunately this thing only works one way. but, if there's anyone else  talk to today, could you make an introduction? 

oooof this was a good idea and absolutely it will not work at all.
