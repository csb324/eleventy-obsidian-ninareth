post <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">up</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[session-5]]</span></span>, thoughts on the party:

[[Costi]]: dope magic missiles, kid. And he handled himself at lunch with guruden. Maybe not the worst liability.

[[Samuel]]: Hugh thinks he's Costis dad but Adrienne thinks Samuel is costi's dad. She does not care for it when he is on her head. get off. 

[[Hugh]]: won't kill a [[Gruung]] -- troubling. his pacifism is worth keeping an eye on, but still: having an indestructible healer around is a good thing. Also he thinks it's fun to practice with the forks!! and this is charming. 

[[Freya]]: GRUUNGSLAYER. adriennes plan with freya at the moment is to hype her up. She doesn't seem like she's gotten a lot of hype in her life, and she's not thirsty for it but that's kind of why it could be effective. 

Making a big deal about being freyas biggest fan -> 
- loyalty
- a more empowered freya (which Adrienne thinks we need, to hold off the forces of impulsive pacifism)
- Plus, she really doesn't ask for much. so, that's always a good thing. 

[[Rez]]: again, really wants to be on the team, whatever the team is. We are sisters in fealty to the gruung! Whenever Adrienne is talking shit about "these people", make sure Rez feels like Adrienne means the others.  unless she's weaponizing it.
