ok so, we told people about the harp and fig and Bevin. Zephra did almost get us killed, and freya started to insist, and if this is going to work they're going to find out eventually, and damn it today was weird. 

to do: 
- bring that stone to the temple of pelor
- go back to the grove and act like I know what I'm doing there. what do I know?? harp. the good parts of ru'nileth. people confusingly being kind to me for no reason. wanting to do the same?
- gotta talk about Rez's box at some point
- I guess we're going to a concert 

we COULD go to the guards about zephra. "I came to get my harp repaired by my friend raven. raven told me she had a harp specialist on staff, and the specialist told us she needed to go to the marketplace for materials. we went to the marketplace, and she started acting really weird - she wouldn't explain, she just said we had to go into an alley. then, when we were there, some guys came out of a cellar?? and they all fought, and we defended ourselves, LUCKILY! anyway, eventually we just ran. that's when we ran into some guards, who were taking our statements... when they just fell asleep. we circled back, and that's when we noticed hoofprints. so we thought they might have a horse?? but my friend Rez is from zalev and she pointed out, maybe the zalevi police took them. and honestly, i HOPe. THATS THE CASE, I'd feel so much safer, because we saw their faces and I just don't know WHO might be after us."

wwjd- go to the guards for sure. 

do I care about zalev? no. do I care about not going to fucking jail? yes, very much. do I also care about not leaving a huge paper trail for Julian to follow? also yes, but, it's a little late for that. 

Niko: smash
