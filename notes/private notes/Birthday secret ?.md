I regret tbis: 1:08

I'd like to say to you Clara my friend 
happy happy happy happy birthday 
I planned to sing, that bits not at its end,
But killed my voice by drinking yesterday

Instead I thought I'd simply say to you
that Wow you're old so old dear god so old
And while you're not the geezer of our crew 

(picked up the ice cream?)
I mean like, pelors light, 30? that's old. 

We all still like you fine, you're pretty neat
an Excellent artist with two good boys 
With friends who cannot underdo a beat? bit?
these videos a yearly burst of joy 

I know a simple birthday wish isn't 
as interesting as a song full of sweat
But I hope this simple and *clear* (picked up the coffee??) visit?? 
with zero hidden meaning, never fret

can still bring joy to you this April day.
Is that the third time that I've rhymed with day?
I'm getting lazy something something hey
Another line, fuck it, it's four, may?

I promise music next year, don't be vexed
and loomis needs you when you see them next 

(mayyyyybe visit the temple of pelor again?)
