ask joe whether Julian has associates in zalev and maybe one major name 

fundamentally respect zephyra fwiw. she handles her own shit. She had something I needed and she got us into a situation 

if someone dies doing this, that's on me. unless it's zephra - she was already involved. but no one ELSE would be involved if not for doing me a favor. so when this is over, be VERY GRAND about it. 

costi reminds me of my PAST self in some ways but he reminds me of all the kids I hated in other ways and that's a good way to give a child whiplash

note to self: do not use real names. fake name: hana. 

REZ: She's in over her head with this box. again. 
Is it now worth intervening?
- might be 
- scolding doesn't work on her, she isn't costi 
- she wants a friend! a friend she shall have. 
- "hey thanks for agreeing to go along with this in the first place. I'm glad we're square on the gold -- the irony is, I was pressed about it because I knew I'd need all the gold I could get to afford this repair. but I realize this situation is more trouble than fifty gold worth"
- speaking of, I hope you didn't take the cash box to pay me back ðŸ¥º I would feel so guilty 

and then, listen. 

"Well If you need help getting it back to niko, let me know. Least I could do."

For most of my life, I was focused on one thing. one goal. I worked my ass off to get it. and it was working, but when I got there, it was... hollow. 

or the MUSIC wasn't hollow... but, everything that came with it. Most things, honestly. 

so I'm at a bit of a loose end, because I can't keep doing what I've been doing, but if I give up  music I don't know what I'll have left. and when I met Fig and Bevin, when I spent time at their temple, I felt like maybe there was another way forward.

We could tell the bartender the guys in his basement were zalevi informants, who wanted to sell out the jalantar criminal organization. They'd betrayed our friend in zalev, and now they are gonna betray YOU so you should tell us everything you know about them, keep an eye out for them, et cetera.

you ever notice how much time they spent around the zalevi embassy? INFORMING!

 goal: alienate these troublemakers from the local crime scene, get them to do our work for us. 

send freya for disguise stuff
