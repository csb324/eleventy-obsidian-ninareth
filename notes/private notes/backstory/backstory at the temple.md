## the temple of [[corellon larethian]] 

From [[Quaath]], she almost went to [[Demphinster]]. She hired a wayfinder. And only a few days into the trip, she got sick. Pretty seriously sick, it seems -- she doesn’t remember most of it, but there was a fever. 

The wayfinder left a note for Adrienne explaining the situation -- she was too sick to go on, and the people at this temple would be able to heal her, but the rest of the travelers in the group needed to continue to demphinster, so when she was feeling better she’d have to make her way back to [[Quaath]] and meet up with the next group.

And when [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] read the note, she was in the [[Temple of Corellon Outside Quaath]]. 

Not a temple like the ones she’d been to as a little girl -- those were bigger, and they were in the city. This was unusually remote, isolated in the hills.

But there were clerics at this temple, and they did heal her. As soon as she was awake, she tried to leave -- she hated being sick, and she hated being at the mercy of total strangers -- but [[Fig]] said absolutely not until she had recovered completely.

Fig was a half-elf as well, which might be why Adrienne listened to her. She looked older than she acted. Her long gray hair was pulled back into a wild bun. 

Honestly, if you ask Adrienne to explain why she stayed at that temple as long as she did, she’d have a hard time making it make sense. After the first day, when she tried to leave and Fig said no, she just sank into it. She rested. She had weird and vivid dreams. Dreams about [[Ru'nileth]]. Dreams about music.

As she healed, she started talking more with [[Fig]], who was tasked with checking on her, and with [[Bevin]] (gnome, also older). And she slowly learned, or maybe remembered, more about what had made those temples from her childhood so magical.

> It was the harp, but it was also… something else. Some way the light reflected off the stones. Something about the sound in the cavernous space -- so unlike a concert hall. The way she could feel people’s internal chaos settle just a little bit when they stepped into the room. There was something here that reminded her of all those things.

Fig and Bevin didn’t prosthelytize much. They asked Adrienne questions about her life. She gave them accurate-but-heavily-sanitized answers. She asked what they were doing in a temple in the wilderness, and they told her it was a long story. 

No one told each other everything, but they talked about a lot.

There was an old harp at the temple, though, and it told its own story. Adrienne took an interest -- you hate to see something so beautiful fall into disrepair -- and although she didn’t have any repair experience, she was able to adjust a few things to make it sound decent. In tune, at least. 

Eventually, she got better.

[[Fig]] looked unreservedly sad to see her go; [[Bevin]] looked a mixture of sad, relieved, and vindicated. She got the feeling [[Bevin]] wanted to like her, but didn’t. She got the feeling [[Fig]] actually did. She genuinely liked both of them. They’d been kind to her for no reason at all. That was a weird thing to do! But she was starting to think, maybe it wasn’t weird? Maybe that was always an option? And usually it would make her suspicious, and this time it didn't, and that was interesting too.

But everything has a price, she knew that. 

So she gave some thought to how to repay them. Not necessarily out of gratitude, although she was grateful. More out of a need to to balance things again. You can’t just go around owing people favors, not knowing when they’ll come to collect. 

Finally, she asked [[Fig]] if she could take the old harp to get properly repaired. Before she could even explain the caveats -- she didn’t know how long the repairs would take, it was possible the harp would be damaged again in transit although she’d be careful, it was even possible that the harp was too damaged to be worth saving -- Fig said absolutely. For whatever reason, she trusted Adrienne. And Adrienne doesn’t know what to make of that either.

But she’s bringing the harp to [[Jalantar]], to [[Raven]] at [[The Gilded Instrument]]. And she’s going to get it repaired, and she’s going to bring it back, and maybe that will resolve the whole thing.
