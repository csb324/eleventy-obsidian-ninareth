# spell vibes

**viscous mockery**: do not hold back at all (this is a good time to be sarcastic and/or generally a bitch)
- can i *help* you?
- did you think this was a *good* idea?
- oh, you might be in over your head
- just look them up and down and say "yikes"

**dissonant whispers** - just a spookier viscious mockery. like "*you're going to die today, you're pathetic, you're nothing, you shouldn't have come, this was a mistake, you will leave nothing behind*" (this is a good time to be very ominous and cut to the core of a person). straight up threats. 

**shatter**: Pluck a harp string SO loud. crescendo that shit until it breaks their brains.

**tasha's hideous laughter**: act like THEY told a joke ("omg remember when you did that thing? that was soooo funny hahahahahahaha")

**bane** - musical, play a discordant song so it bounces off their heads the worst

**hold person** -
