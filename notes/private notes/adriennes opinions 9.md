### Hugh
honestly you can't even be mad at him, he's like a space alien. 
HOWEVER he cannot have these gemstones. because we do not know if they are real, and if he is counting on them to save our lives, that's a problem for all of us.

(also he doesn't have that spell yet lol)

### Costi
rez said he listens to me more than her.  that's probably true. worth giving some thought to what style of cool he might be made into.

### Rez
goddamn it, so many things would be easier if she just paid me back. at this point it's a bit.
**new plan**: forget all about the 50 gold. don't let it become a funny joke. don't give a reaction at all. but continue freezing her out a *little*.

### Freya
seems anxious to get to jalantar. same.

# other npcs
### Niko
probably good to start sort of fading out on him. but not in an awkward way. on the other hand i require people to all be in love with me. 
ah, but i am so unattainable
i'm just gonna be the unattainable sexy mysterious type 

# metaphysical
sort of feel the feeling from the temple slipping away, not happy about it. looking forward to getting this harp repaired asap. 

should send fig a letter when we arrive in jalantar.
