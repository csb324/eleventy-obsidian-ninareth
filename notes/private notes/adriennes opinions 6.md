post <span class="dataview inline-field"><span class="inline-field-key">up</span><span class="inline-field-value">[[session-6]]</span></span>, thoughts on the party:

- juliette is right, travelling with hugh all the time would have significant advantages.
- costi thinks the normal way to date someone is to be friends for half a decade first. lmao this kid has baggage.
	- also joe mentioned his family background was extremely wary of surveillance... interesting!!!

##### Adrienne's intuition is telling her to help freya with this circles question. 
- ask freya about the circles
- freya has an ex-fiance??? gonna have to follow up on that one
	- "So you almost got married. Spill."
Tell her I want to help her with this
(Also ask niko to draw the circles from the field -> BEFORE talking to freya.)

##### re: niko
- silently beckon him in a sexy way (try to do this before he encounters the group)
- something acknowledging the awkwardness of the morning / my vagueness 
	- "interesting day, huh"
	- "Hey I hope I didn't offend you this morning."
	- IF he pushes or it seems natural: "im a little bit mid-reinvention right now, does that make sense? trying to get some distance from some things."
	- THEN ask about circles

##### politics
honestly safest not to engage much with the providers politically. look supportive, obviously. Maybe mention I can't be too vocal because of my job. 

(Also, Tim/costi clearly really wants to and it's not fun if I'm kicking him under the table the whole time lol)

##### HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT JULIAN
- avoidant for one thing 
- Let everyone keep thinking she works for him because HE thinks she still works for him and she doesn't want word getting back to him that she doesn't intend to keep doing so 
- don't do things that will piss him off
- the GOAL is for him to believe she's been working for him in his absence and has SLOWLY determined she has learned enough actually thank you
- She doesn't really want to get to the bottom of things, she just wants to live her own life for a minute 
- He will come for her 
- MAYBE he will just say "ok hi time for job again" and she needs enough power to say no, sorry, find another assistant
- MAYBE he will say "how daaaaare you" and then she REALLY needs backup because he will end her life (unless it's somehow costly to do so. the problem right now is that it would basically cost him nothing to just take her off the board)
- The temple felt like something more powerful, more right
- maybe these people are also, together, a type of power?? worth considering. 
     - but they're also a liability, so. 
     - Who's to say 


why leave Julian at all
- does evil things 
- holding me back / controlling 
- empty
