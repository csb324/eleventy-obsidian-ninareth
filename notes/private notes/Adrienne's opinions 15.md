Quorin needs to be a friend. stagehand friends would be good for us. 

We're gonna have to tell niko about this 

freya got a note when she left her hometown. that's weird!

Costi's dad told him no one has to see it for a good thing to do to be a good thing to do. that like... seems like they're talking about a different game than the one I've been playing. 

Also poor costi doing a homicide. 

Adrienne got druunkkk and said perhaps too much. 

in character what to do about Rez vs out of character what to do about Rez are very different questions 

In character she can't keep doing this. out of character, ok, this is her quirk or something. How do we mold it into something that doesn't trigger the fuck out of Adrienne. plus how to get Adrienne to be cool-ish about it without "not my chair not my problem" because that's gonna make the vibe weird. 

oh, we have party funds! That helps. Taking money decisions out of her hands is genuinely good. maybe we all just agree to pay Rez insurance. If the good outweighs the bad.
