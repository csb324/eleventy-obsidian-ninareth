# Meta Knowledge

Letter from Home:
	Kaloren - I'm so thrilled to hear that our suggestions helped bridge your most recent research blockage. We have found that a willing participant serves as a much more effective conduit for the Derival Plinth's energy; a thrall serves in a pinch, but you waste so much effort forcing them to assist you. Having them volunteer leads to less spillage. This should mean you're close to making your next attempt, correct? Do you have a date set? We'd like to watch the skies to ensure we can follow your ongoing efforts, even from half a world away! Additionally, I wanted to let you know that your advice has once again born fruit. An indirect approach, while somewhat wasteful (it seems waste of magical energy is becoming a theme of this message!) has allowed us to circumvent her quite significant barriers, and we are making excellent progress. Barring any significant delays, I suspect we'll have finalized crystals--improved upon the most recent batch we sent you--within the month! Good luck with your ascention, and I hope to have followers in your name leading prayer groups in our camps soon. As Ever, Under the Eye, Your Friend Sezathkathon
