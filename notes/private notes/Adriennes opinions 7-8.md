re: [[session-8]] and [[session-7]]

# party

### Hugh
if we want the rewards of traveling with an indestructible healing robot, we must suffer the mortifying ordeal of being seen with costi. damn though, he's good at healing! 

### Costi
once we're officially a group, this kid needs to rethink his vibe. he needs a cooler vibe. An image overhaul. a PR campaign. I can get Rez to do this. 

### Rez
honestly delegating to her is a dynamic that works pretty well. Rez is so game, so if Adrienne wants something done but doesn't want to do it -- Rez is right there and probably doesn't even mind. 

### Freya
she doesn't trust me either and we love that for her!! intuition says, whatever trouble she's in isn't something she had coming. which is unusual. 

also, gotta hire her for the way back to quaath.

(does adrienne believe this or does she believe it's the best way to convince hugh and costi to delay their dad-hunt? wink emoji)
