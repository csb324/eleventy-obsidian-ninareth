she's not *scared* she's *fucked* there's a difference. re: [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|julian]]

[[Niko]] knows a LOT. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was over it but we do love a man of mystery. Also he's a voter! Wild. 

this temple of [[pelor]] ghostly business is pretty weird. 
I bet we could sell the [[summoning stone]], but I don't want to. 

idea -- 
draw up a contract 
- we split all payment equally among the five of us
- *If we find a stone and the stone is magical, we do not keep the stone except as a last resort.*
- if a payment explicitly given to the group cannot be divided equally, we will have the payment appraised.  each of us shall hold one fifth ownership. 
- when one owner is decided for the item, the new owner shall buy out the other party members shares, paying 20% of the price to each remaining party member 
- If, *after appraisal*, one party member holds an item for longer than a period of 14 days, that constitutes ownership and they will need to begin paying out the remaining party members for the item (or sell the item, or return it to the party)
- **exception**: life saving items (such as healing items) shall be distributed for expediency in the case of emergency. using a life saving item is in everyone's interest.
- if one person insists on entering a preventable life threatening situation over the advice of 4/5 of us, and life saving items are used in that situation, that party member will be liable for the value of those items. before the event takes place, 4/5 of the group must invoke this rule verbally and the final party member must affirm that they understand.

I don't want us to screw each other over. People screw each other over. this is less about the money and more about having clear expectations
