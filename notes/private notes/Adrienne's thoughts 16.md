"do you still have a sense of loyalty to your employer?"
".... no."
"do you have a sense of loyalty to anyone except yourself?"
Adrienne laughs a little 
"wow, okay. I sound like a bad person if I say no, huh. well. no one's earned it"

WELL THAT GOT REAL

what would it take for her to change her mind?

it's gonna be the party. 

by my count, Hugh has saved my life at least twice. that's good but it's also his job. still, developing a soft spot. he's also given me good advice?? idk what they scrambled his brain with but it was probably gold. 

that would be a good question to ask Hugh. "how did you get like this? like, not like other warforged?" in a pillow fort maybe, for safety

about the hotel, two options 

1. just book another one and announce it confidently 
2. pay a bit of the bill with the gem money 

(Adrienne does not want to burn all of the guruden goodwill. it's more important to keep him thinking fondly of us)

--------

to do: with group funds, find a way to secure group funds. a lockbox or bag of holding or something secure. we have too much money to just be walking around with it in a bag. 

(Adrienne is stressed about money)

--------

 practice the harp WITH the rose. 

Adrienne knows how to power through being frustrated. she's done this before. this time is kind of different but not really. 

so usually, she would stop, breathe,read the sheet music again or practice the fingering on her arm or imagine the crescendo. it's no good to play frustrated. a lot of the skills are just emotional management. so, she knows how to do that. 

now, rather than focusing on the technical elements, focus on the rose (as a way to stand in for the rest of the corellon larethian jnsq). she *likes* the rose. zoom in on *that* to reset, and try again.

JULIAN QUESTIONS 

so like, I've been very vague about "yeah Adrienne knows he's doing behind the scenes shit" but it would help if I knew like, an example or two he'd be doing that Adrienne WOULD have known about (given that she saw the trees but not the forest). 

(he's gonna put it in my google doc)

re: Chelseaâ€™s question "yes sir" vs "got it" -- that is 100% dependent on whether Julian would have requested yes sir. Adrienne is a "got it" person but if he wanted her to call him sir, she would have. but I do want to know which one 

(it's sir in public, always. in private, Adrienne slowly stopped) 

Why does Julian have Adrienne's self esteem in a chokehold?
- he is as critical of her as she is of herself. this means (to her) he is also the only person who sees what she's capable of. he's not grading her on a curve. he's pushing her because, theoretically, he believes she CAN be better than she is. he doesn't waste time. 

most people haven't heard of Julian 
most people at redscale would recognize the name from the buildings. 
most who have heard of him know him as a musician 
so who the fuck is niko
