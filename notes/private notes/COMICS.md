Private: true

Rez and Adrienne both sneaking out front doors across the street from one another (niko's house. deeksta's house)
"oh hi"

Rez: so what were you doing before this?
costi: we ran into some frogs 
everyone: that probably won't come up again though 
frogs: wrong!!

frog: where have you taken me (coming from inside a shed)
Adrienne: somewhere safe. We want to join you. 
Rez: we worship frogs. Tell us your plan so we can help
frog: seems legit
Freya: behind frogs with an ice pick

Rez: winking and doing finger guns: you're fancy!
guruden looking totally jolly and pleasant: yes.


(Hugh -- smiling, walking around with everyone.  a thought bubble like "I know a lot of gossip!")


victor: thank goodness you were able to warn us of the  attack tomorrow morning. now I hope you'll still be coming to my bbq tonight. 
costi: I wouldn't miss it!!
deeksta: they're actually sleeping there 


Just toasty costi 


I could draw a quiet tinzelven at night. Like, an inverted drawing. 

our pixie friends waking us up, Hugh awake in the corner like "WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON"

the frogs come in, madness ensues 

Hugh looking down at a frog: war is hell 

Cleaning very bloody room, Adrienne and Rez are drinking. 
Adrienne: ... you still owe me fifty gold btw 


ANYWAY BACK TO COMICS?
