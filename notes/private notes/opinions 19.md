Ok ok plan. Options. 

### ask Julian to let her stay. 

"Mister slater runehorn, we need a new arrangement.

We both know I'm capable of more than filing papers. Everyone important I meet already thinks I'm running your errands. but I've *almost* convinced this group that I want nothing to do with you. That was for my own purposes, at first, but I think it puts both of us in an advantageous position, don't you think?"

## change her name and go into hiding 

Nahhh

## just sign back up for team Julian 

nope 

## Simply refuse?

I mean..... it's not a GOOD idea. but it's an IDEA. 

## end things amicably?

Doesn't seem like an option. 

# How fucked are we
depends a lot on how this jailbreak goes. 

subsequently: this also impacts how fucked adrienne is wrt Julian 

# Doubts!!!

reasons why it makes sense to bail on this whole thing and link up with Julian again:
1. no one else is going to push me as hard (but also!? he is intentionally holding me back!)
2. Perhaps I've been naive and irresponsible to ghost my boss and that's a me problem 
3. Being his enemy isn't workable.

best option is to work with him but keep traveling. give him updates. exaggerate how much costi doesn't trust me, so I don't have to give up too much information. 

> fuck, connecting herself to other people and putting them in Julian's line of fire is the most selfish thing Adrienne has ever done.
> if he starts coming after them, the noble thing for Adrienne to do would be to hand herself over. 
> is she noble? uh not at the moment
> but what a dramatic turn that would be 

do not under any circumstances tell Julian about the temple of corellon larethian

-------

she is genuinely ambitious. she can use that. or she can appear weak in the ways he expects her to be. and he can give up on her... or frame her for zalevi crimes. fuck, he doesn't even have to frame her. she's CURRENTLY DOING zalevi crimes. 

------- 

also, operation be-endearing-to-giary was a success.

What's safe to tell Julian 
- traveling with wayfinders 
- Got stuck in tinzelven 
- Willen guruden had a problem that we agreed to help solve, he was very appreciative, he sends his regards by the way
- Frogs 
- Oh, Jensen davor is representing a new band that's actually pretty impressive 
- Costi is looking for his father, but he's in denial because his father is for sure dead. still, costi is holding something back
- Hugh is an oddity 


Freya is the first capable wayfinder I've ever traveled with, and she's still a trainee. 
Rez can make anyone her friend,
The warforged is a healer, if you can believe that,
And I don't know what,
But Costi is involved in something big. He's in over his head, but he won't share it with me. And you could change that, if you wanted to. 

So he could like, publically fire Adrienne. To sell it. 

So the party would -think- ok they're done. He must have been so mad about something. 

then they'd apply their brains for two seconds and realize, no, that could have been a lie

So, IMMEDIATELY tell costi, "do not tell me another word about your father." Because if she doesn't know, she has nothing to tell Julian. unless he just tells her 60% wrong information? 

putting me in a confusing situation! Because I want to help FIND his father. no, this won't work. 

plus, then I can't do any of his other errands.

**Over the last few months, ive been learning to use everything you taught me. Before you left, I had been holding myself back. But im ready now. I still have so much to learn from you. And I think I can help you more from out here.**

I'm more capable than I was when you left. 

Let me prove it to you.

Different kinds of intimacy look different For different people. 

to solve my impulsivity I need to remember I'm FEELING How Adrienne feels. I'll *feel* shocked and then think what would she do when shocked. but actually I need to think, DOES she feel shocked? because I'm acting like a shocked Adrienne but Adrienne wouldn't be shocked. or, mad, or, embarrassed, or, entertained. 

when elhelaind mentioned Julian, I went through a panic tunnel but Adrienne did not. 

Adrienne thought, "oh  :|  hm :\"

which is much more manageable. she's thinking quickly but calmly. "How do I make this work. honesty. go."

and then one step ahead for each thing he said like she's working through a puzzle but also surfing or something. following the conversation where it went. keeping up. keeping calm. she doesn't give the friends a flash of panic. she actually isn't panicking. she knows this is bad, though.
