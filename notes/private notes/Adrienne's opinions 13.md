what is niko involved with and is it possible he is perhaps on the run from these zalevi slave carchers? It feels possible.

(Huge q: Adrienne and **Rez** flirting ??? )
I wouldn't rule it out!!

take it along the lines of "friends who tell each other they're so pretty" and see what the vibe is. Could really just be a fun basis for a friendship but if the vibe shifts... it's an interesting idea 
like, roommates who stay up late talking and then something more feels like it might happen 

Adrienne is never going to get a good reason to like Rez so it has to just happen spontaneously 

just like, a very fond "you're adorable" once in a while will get the point across. no need to belabor it. plant the seed.

I want to know what's up with freya so bad. she just seems chill but she's got things going on. there's things going on in there. The problem isn't that she's hiding it, that's her business. but what manner of things? 
her history isn't what's interesting. Her present has questions. How are you finding the southern cities, have you traveled with any interesting people, what's true north like generally, etc 

Costi needs a plan. getting Hugh help is a plan, and a good one, but that's not why we're in jalantar. what did you come here for.

i want to start calling Hugh something like, chief, or captain or something. The colonel!!!! omg call him the colonel. Something good will happen. I don't know what. 

this weed is making me like, way too insightful

here's a question: is corellon fucking with me or something 

that would be a mean joke and i would not want to be on the wrong end of it. if you're getting bullied by DEITIES, there's really not much you can do to get back at them. 

walk in there confident.
**"Hi. I was here yesterday to get a message delivered. I wanted to check on that, and wanted to spend some time in here with my harp, if there's a good place to do that. Thanks."**

@ CORELLON

okay. i'm here. i'm trying. i *literally* don't know what i'm doing here, but if i'm reading this right, you've made it clear that you have something to say. 

You have been showing up in too many places for it to be a coincidence. you turn up in my life *exactly* when i'm backed into a dead-end. and

so, i'm listening, okay? you've gotten my attention. if you want something, say so.
