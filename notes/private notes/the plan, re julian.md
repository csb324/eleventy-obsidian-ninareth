when he calls for adrienne... 

# option a: just be super polite
message back, thank him for the opportunity but you'll be continuing on your own for the forseeable future. write kindly about all you have learned. emphasize that this was a difficult decision, but that you must follow your instincts. wish him the best. 

is this likely to work: depends, how willing is he to give her up?
is this likely to have negative externalities: probably
would adrienne do this: maybe

# option b: avoidance

if he contacts you... simply do not answer

is this likely to work: lmao, no
is this likely to have negative externalities: absolutely
would adirenne do this: nahhh

# option c: maybe we can talk this out
