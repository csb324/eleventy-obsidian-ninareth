A flyer that fell from ash generated from a wild display of heatless fire that covered the roof of the Lillith Hall during the after party at the [[Bellisme Show]]

From the [[Fire Raisers]], and maybe some help from [[The Unforged Few]] and potentially [[Rhend Triverswill]]

### The Flyer

To all loyal people of [[Arkhosia]] -

We call ourselves free. We pride ourselves, here in the “Most Democratic Nation in [[Ninarith]],” on our devotion to individual
liberty. We look down on our “oppressive” neighbors. The slave-trading [[Zalev]]. The soul-snaring [[Eberron]]. Even the domineering [[Slavaadi College]]. We think ourselves enlightened, better.

Free.

But what does freedom mean? Freedom, in a nation where only the select few can determine the course of millions? Freedom, in a nation where that select few revel in excess, most barely scrape by, and the rest live in abject squalor? Freedom, in a nation that quietly aids and abets the greatest humanoid rights abuses that this continent has seen since the Second Sundering?

Make no mistake: We. Are. Not. Free.

We exist today to serve a parasitic government and upper class that drinks from us like an [[Eberron]] noble, that puts its own self-interest ahead of the needs of its people, that will not police itself and cannot allowed to operate any longer. Time and time again, our leaders have had an opportunity to hold themselves and each other to account, and time and time again they have failed. Now, it is our turn.

When [[Norathar Pent]] was jailed, was it for her crimes against her workers? Was it for trapping hundreds of [[Jalantar]] citizens into inescapable cycles of poverty, grinding them into nothing more than the sawdust that fills her warehouses? For keeping them in run-down tenements, with just enough compensation to survive? For treating their bodies like machines? For filling her security rosters with jackbooted thugs and violent psychopaths who terrorized the district?

No. It was for drug trafficking, embezzlement of company funds, and–based on the severity of the charges against her now, most heinously–tax avoidance. Is this justice?

When [[Vigo Underswell]] was jailed, was it for his crimes against his constituents? For forcing renters and the impoverished out of their homes to enrich himself and his fat-cat friends? For allowing himself to fall into such debt that he was nothing more than a rubber stamp for those who would undermine the stability of his city for their own self benefit?

No. He was jailed for drug trafficking, embezzlement of public funds, and–once again, most legally significant according to the records we’ve reviewed–tax avoidance. Is this justice?

The priorities of those who run this country are clear. They work to protect their own power, privilege, position, and wealth, and to keep all those below them below them forever. But today, we say enough.

It is long past time that the oligarchs and elected autocrats who control this country, Provider or Guardian, be set aside. We call today for the following actions to be taken immediately by the leadership of both major parties in [[Arkhosia]], by the municipal governments of both [[Arkhosia (City)]] and [[Jalantar]], and by [[The Circle]]:
1. Permanently end all taxation for those who, as of today, do not have access to the franchise.
2. End all land requirements for access to the franchise.
3. End all wealth requirements for access to the franchise.
4. Forbid the sentence of involuntary labor as a punishment for any crime.
5. Suspend the sentences of all Arkhosians currently serving involuntary labor as punishment for a crime.
6. Terminate diplomatic relations with both [[Eberron]] and [[Zalev]] until they end their internationally recognized
practices of the nonconsensual manipulation of the undead, and lifetime involuntary servitude, respectively.
7. Immediately provide [[Mulfara]] with material support in their defense of their soverignty, including but not
limited to weapons, spellcasting components and focuses, military training, financial resources, and any
Arkhosian volunteer wishing to offer their services.
8. Make statements of support for, and provide assistance to, freedom fighters in nations anywhere in Ninarith
striving against oppressive regimes.

Should we not see action on these demands before the elections scheduled to take place in two months, our response will be swift, direct, and severe. [[Jalantar]] and [[Arkhosia (City)]] have already seen what we are capable of and how far our reach goes. Our tactics will escalate. There is nothing that we will not do to bring real freedom to Arkhosia.

To the great people who live under the thumb of oppressors in our flawed nation, know that we are here. We are legion. And we will fight for you.

To those with their boots on the necks of the Arkhosian people, let this be a warning: We are here. We are legion. And we are willing to die–and burn–for our freedom.

From the ashes.
