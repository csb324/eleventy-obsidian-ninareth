# Samson

An Aasimar, half-deva or planatar, and she didn't know they were still on the prime material. He's arrived with his family, and an elephantine named [[Ferdinand]]. 

Wearing the most obnoxious outfit any of us have ever seen. He has a light blue wolf cut, it a little portly, covered in bright, moving, contrasting patterns, and wear white gloves. He's made flashcards of who everyone was in [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. 

### Who's He to Us?
One of [[Eirian]]'s people, also tied to [[Gemma]]. Helping with [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]]. Seems like he may be a [[Synchrona]]. Wants to kill [[Alhoon]]s, specifically, [[Sezathkathon]].

More importantly, he's had a sense that all of us will be key in each other's lives, to [[Eirian|E]] and to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. Weird.

### What's His Deal?
[[Samson]] tells us about his magical divorce making him powerless, until he picked up a sword and fell into a lake with a [[Kraken]] who wanted to come to the [[Prime Material]], and needed help, in exchange giving [[Samson]] power. We get a whole scoop about his ex [[Rill]] and her new wife [[Vani]] and the messy messy implosion of his last marriage. 

Once he got here he realized the [[Kraken]] was going to hurt a lot of people, wanted to come into [[Yent Lake]] - he lost his power, again. He's in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] but is pretty upset with [[Samson]] and will likely be sending folks after him. 

After that, he was laying in bed and saw a woman (read: a devil formerly know as [[Gemma]]) in a very hot room with butterfly wings, who said something like, "[[Samson]] you're involved in things bigger than you join me and I'll help you kill [[Sezathkathon]]". He's part of the [[Cult of the Butterfly Queen]]. She was very helpful with scoping out the [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]].

[[Samson]]'s realized he's a good window for powerful beings. We wonder if [[Samson]] is a [[Synchrona]]. He says he can ask [[Gosar]] and [[Elgen]] if they've heard of this. We decide it's too big of a risk. [[Eirian]] notes how the concentration of the Weave seemed to tie into the planar overlap.
