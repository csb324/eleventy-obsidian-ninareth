# Detailed Notes: Session 47

For recap, see also: 

As we step into the clearing, we see a table set with a meal and a large gazebo, a few islands surrounding them. We also see a man in red leafy armour, with red skin and pointy ears, looks sort of like [[Tobias]]. There three female figures, who seem like the hags of [[The Beauties of Shadow]]. 

[[Threthdia Scrivit]] scoffs and drops pretenses -- they attack.

[[Freya]] uses the first [[Curator Quills]] on her [[+1 Ice Pick]], as she does, the metal lightens and is coated by a misty gray material. It does a bunch of extra necrotic damage.

It goes very poorly, folks are compelled and frigthened, [[Rez]] gets paralyzed and goes unconscious, [[Hugh]] heals a whole bunch, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gets hugged in a very unpleasant way but [[Rez]] makes sure it doesn't kill her, [[Threthdia Scrivit]] calls [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] theives, [[Costi]] hastes [[Freya]] , which lets her use the second [[Curator Quills]] on [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s back which seemed to reduce some of her strength. 

The fight goes on, and after seeing [[Threthdia Scrivit]] get healed by [[Tobias]] and everyone in [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] approaching exhaustion --[[Freya]] uses the last [[Curator Quills]] quill on herself. Bet that won't cause any longterm issues! 

On we fight, and everyone gets down to their final spells and the last legs, when [[Threthdia Scrivit]] finally overcomes [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. Knocking her unconscious, then tearing into her over and over until she dies. 

Turning her attention to [[Rez]], she does a handful of attacks before [[Freya]] - fully raging digs her claws into [[Threthdia Scrivit]] eyes, pulling her down and spitting in her face, killing her. 

We shortly kill [[Tobias]] and as the final hag runs into their hut, [[Freya]] chases and finds a trap of small rogue goblins. As she wails on them, the mirror ahead of her lengthens and opens to show a garden that looks remarkably similar to where we are. A way home perhaps?

The rest of the party leaves her to the fight, as [[Hugh]], [[Rez]], and [[Costi]] prepare to attempt to bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back to life. We rush through the window to get her back home.

[[Hugh]] begins the ritual, and calls out the power of the garden, telling [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] it would be such a shame to watch her rose wither. Overwhelmed with the gravity of whats happening, he struggles to convince her. [[Rez]] laments how short of a time they've had, and asks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] a riddle that she begs her to answer "The fewer you have, the more they're worth". [[Costi]] demands [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] remember all that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] put her through and says she has to come back to make him pay. 

The diamonds on her neck behind to glow, but then struggle. Watching the light starting to fade, silver drops off the material from [[The Curator]] on [[Freya]]'s blade, as [[Freya]] begs [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to come back. The lights pulse once, and despite our hope -- it doesn't seem to be enough to save her. 

In our panic, we realize time has passed from our trip to [[the Feywild]] - the sun is up now, and [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s house is on fire. 

Confused and grieving, [[Rez]] tries to ask [[Hugh]] what happened in the ritual, why wasn't she coming back? He responds "I failed" and walks off. [[Costi]] runs after him, saying it was all of us together, and that we have to stand as a team right now. [[Rez]] and [[Freya]] desperately try and talk through what to do next, as the fire grows.

Grasping at any chance, [[Rez]] sendings to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] "You want your rewards? You have your plans? Bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back. We tried... it didn't work. Make this happen". He replies, "We can discuss this further at my residence".

Panicking, we gather together and run [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to [[Corellon's Grove]], shouting for [[Dawenys]] to help. [[Dawenys]] says they don't know anyone that can bring her back, that isn't something they're capable of, and [[Rez]] asks if they know someone that can talk to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. Agreeing that was possible, [[Dawenys]] goes to find someone who can help. 

While she's gone, [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] discusses what it would mean to bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back, if it indebts her further, given that all she's ever wanted is freedom. [[Freya]] is determined to find a way, but [[Rez]] is adamant that she wouldn't want to come back under the hand of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] or [[The Curator]]. We don't know what to do. 

A cleric from [[Temple of Pelor in Jalantar]] arrives and says he can help us talk to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], so we think through what we want to say.

Questions to Adrienne:

Do you want to come back? We miss you. 
I think I tried, but it's not bad here. I'll miss you

If we can find a way, using [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] or our other friend ([[The Curator]]), with no debts, would you come back? 
Shit if it's easy! I assume it's not though. No debts is rarely actually no debts.

If you've found your freedom, and don't want to come back, is there anything you want from us? 
I should thank you... You're the only people I would need to tell. 

Are you happy there?
Yea, I mean. I don't think I'm supposed to be dead. But, don't worry too much about it.

Is there anything you wanted to get done, that we could do for you?
There's a harp I wanted to bring back to Quaath, I promised them I would. I don't want them to think I just took it.

As our ability to speak with her fades, she gives us one last message -- 
	Thank you for trying, to bring me back. The four of you meant a lot to me. 

She exhales one last time, and breathes out a final note... 
	and tell [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] to eat shit

As [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] tries to process what [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is telling us, [[Dawenys]] breaks our mourning to tell us the awards ceremony with the [[the Mayor of Jalantar]] is in 30 minutes, which means we were in [[the Feywild]] for just under two days. We decide to cancel our attendance -- we send a note to [[Victor]], and [[Costi]] sends one to [[Qik]]. 

Searching for answers, we decide to split up. [[Hugh]] and [[Costi]] head towards the [[Dragonsfire Forge]] while [[Rez]] and [[Freya]] go to find [[The Silver Halves]].
