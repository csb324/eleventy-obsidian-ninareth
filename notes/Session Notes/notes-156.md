# Detailed Notes: Session 156

We head to our meeting with [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]]. We feel like we're being tailed for the first minute or so of our journey, but we lose them. 

Reaching the safehouse, we do our designated code knock and are let into a basement. Entering into the main room, there's a group of 5 [[ELA]] bodymen. [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] is the only one we recognize, he says he's started traveling with a retinue for protection. 

He didn't know about the mimcry vampires, but says they've been actively trying to let the country know about the human farms and have been actively trying to let people know. We say there's 

They try to push that the bombs should still be used, because they need the narrative, and would maybe even dangle [[ELA]] leadership in the [[Stormwall district]] to try and draw [[Eberronian Military]] back to the area. We push back - it's ineffective and innocents will die. The people who could tell what's happening already exist and could tell that narrative without new monsters freed. 

[[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] tries to convince [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] that it's more helpful for us to push more military into the area, and keep the resources invested, and that they will try to set the bombs so that they push monsters into the streets. 

They say there's 57 bombs currently planted underground. We push that these undead can be smart, are releasing other creatures, and what good is winning the city if it's then overrun by undead?

That finally gets through to him some. He pushes that we must make it our priority to know where the military is moving so that they can keep the plan and funnel undead there. Anything else will significantly reduce the [[ELA]]'s chance of success. This is, they feel, their only shot. He asks for 48 hours notice on where we think military will be stationed. We offer for the bombs to be recalled, and placed on the tenement walls to free those inside. He says if we truly can't get the information they need, they'll pull bombs back. 

[[Costi]] proposes if maybe we put the [[Bone Breakers]] into the [[Stormwall district]] to discredit the [[Eberronian First Division]]. 

We go back to the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] to attempt to act like we never left. [[Freya]] immediately goes to find [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]], bringing along two glasses of scotch. He's with two army buddies, a dwarf [[Corp. Dulram Blackfury]] and a human [[Corp. Gol Mekorsk]], both of the [[Eberronian First Division]]. [[Freya]] makes them both super uncomfy before flirting. She also learns that [[Fingers]] has a pretty traumatic past. [[Freya]] uses the unknowable question of turning on a light as her segue. It works. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] stays close to [[Dania]], helping her with her tasks. Once they're alone, [[Hugh|Finn]] tries to see about her interest in freetime

[[Rez]] and [[Costi]] talk about the plan to put the [[Bone Breakers]] into the [[Stormwall district]], and talk through pros and cons. We decide to bring it up to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]. She already has plans for [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] and his crew - but they've already put things into motion on other options. They'll try to help us get information on where the [[Eberronian First Division]] will be on [[ELA Day of Action]] in the [[Stormwall district]]. 

There will likely be 'some' [[Eberronian Second Division]] still in the city, they'll know more in a few days. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] does say the upside is [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] could help clean out any that remain after our [[A Murder of Dukes]] plan. 

In the morning, as she leaves, [[Freya]] leaves a note telling [[Fingers]] she would like to try her pies. 

[[Rez]] gets a sending, "Transmission from [[Father Thronestone]]: unfortunately he has hit delays on travel - running three days behind, apologies, thank you."

[[Freya]] gets an invitation from [[Fingers]] to get pie. We talk about who's invited, and who has first (or second) dibs on hanging with her. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] clearly grants permission for [[Freya]] to do as she wishes, but [[Costi]] decides to tag along. [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Rez]] plan their own drinks - they go to [[The Dollhouse]], walls covered in antique babydolls. The owner, [[Nemia]] brings us the House cocktail, a saucer of alcoholic milk, and a tin of cookies. 

[[Rez]] asks [[Hugh|Finn]] why he wrote the letter, he plays dumb. He tries to turn the conversation about [[Rez]]'s recent traumas, and lack of pranks. [[Rez]] ignores that and swerves right into the need to plan more pranks. 

[[Rez]], sendings to [[Giary]], "WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THIS BAR, dolls, owner needs lesson staying on theme, horny old lady, [[The Dollhouse]]." He replies, "On my way".

[[Freya]] goes to get pie with [[Fingers]], at a place called [[Binkies]], turns out pies aren't on the menu, you have to be in the know. It very quickly descends, turns our [[Fingers]] room shares a wall with [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]]. [[Fingers]] likes what she hears. She hasn't ever gone there with [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]], she thought he only went for warforged, but thinks it makes sense as they so much in common -- both only minutes away from losing it at times. [[Fingers]] says they are deliberate, even if they appear not to be. 

Beyond that, [[Fingers]] has ordered her a 12 mini-pie flight, and they are some of the best of the pies she's ever had. [[Fingers]] says [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] and [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] have asked them to keep an eye on [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], and they've heard many things about us -- including who [[Freya]] has slept with. They head back to our house. 3/5 for [[Fingers]].

Meanwhile, [[Costi]] is planning his own elaborate prank. 

[[Giary]] arrives at [[The Dollhouse]]. He's obsessed. We decide we should each adopt a doll. [[Hugh|Finn]] finds a doll that he's seen before, maybe 170 years ago, it was sent by a former close friend, [[Baemier]] to his daughter. The doll was named Eloisa. [[Rez]] finds a lookalike. [[Giary]] finds one that's been burned. [[Hugh|Finn]] tries to determine how Eloisa came to be here. She was her great-great-grandmothers, sent to her by her father at war. [[Nemia]] says there are family diaries, and offers to help [[Hugh|Finn]] learn more about what happened to his friend. 

Finally coming home, [[Rez]] sees [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] in the hallway!!! As she tries to react, a wall of force surrounds her, she's shoved into her room, and where a wall should be, instead is air -- she falls right into a trap. Her coochie is out again. Good prank [[Costi]]!!
