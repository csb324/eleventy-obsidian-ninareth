# Session 162

As we are going to rest, [[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], "Need to know if you are still alive. I will be the person to talk to [[Costi]] if needed. We were successful in our endeavor ", he replies, "[[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] and I are both alright. Bruised, but alright. Many good people died today, we escaped west. When you can, tell us how you were successful."

[[Freya]] asks [[The Curator]] do they know what the fuck was up with [[Colvia Ghul]], they reply yes, [[Freya]] asks why she was called [[Synchrona]], or why she heard a mysterious pinging when [[Colvia Ghul]] hit her, but they stop responding. 

In the morning, the vibes are all over the place, [[Freya]] uses this morning to tell us about [[Colvia Ghul]], and how she was particularly concerned with her staying alive. 

[[Rez]] uses the [[sending stone]] to [[Trisha]], "Hey we did it!! You are okay? Fivey? Your mom seems to have handled things - should we come there? We don't know how things went.", she replies, "Yes! We wanted to let you rest, things are handled for now. But come over when you can, there’s obviously lots of news." 

We walk to the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], the city is empty, we are stopped several times to explain why we're out against the shelter-in-place order, but are always free to go. The [[Eberronian First Division]] and [[Eberronian Second Division]] are mixed in their patrol, something we note happening for the first time. There are various signs of the fight, blood on the streets, windows broken, and several destroyed guard houses. 

We finally get a read out of the [[Night of Storms]] and join the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] for a readout. 
* [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] believes [[Colvia Ghul]] will takeover as the interim chamberlain
* We share about [[Colvia Ghul]]'s interest in [[Freya]] and told them about [[Synchrona]]
* [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] lived, but did make a number of tactical mistakes
* [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] lived, and worked with [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] to secure the [[Stormwall district]], alongside the [[Made Fors]] - they minimized casualties as much as possible, and took about 180 [[ELA]] prisoners
* At the gates, [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] reclaimed one, but then was extremely harsh with the [[ELA]] there, at least 200 dead. [[Teld]]'s division lost around 500. [[Fingers]] secured the other, took some prisoners. 
* Overall, the night did not go well for the [[ELA]] - around 200 prisoners and 500 casualties. 
	* [[Niko]], [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], and [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] all survived
* In the government, [[Nacrissa Thrudec]] was killed (we assume thanks to [[Niko]]). We killed [[Jehneim Bastienev]] and [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]
* [[Trisha]] lead some internal level pulling, and [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] is assisting in their maneuvering post
* [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] recaptured [[Dobosta Cumunzal]]
* [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] cared 15ish [[ELA]] fighters, we arrived just as they killed [[Duchess v'Dharinov]], who was with [[Marius A]] and [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]], and tried to pursue them but couldn't spot or find the attackers. 
	* [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says it should be fine to remove the modify memory in a few months, and then will try to transfer him to serve under [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]

There will be the official week of mourning, and at the end a new Duke or Duchess will be selected. [[Duke v'Luthei]] is the one who passes along the undeath, unofficially of course. There are 5 likely candidates: [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], two friends: [[Mordra Grethgevarr]] and [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]], and two less aligned, [[Jehneim Bastienev]]'s apprentice [[Sylgeiros Crimsonmane]], and [[Vragar Aldea]], [[Marius A]]'s father.

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Terrav]], "Alive? I am worried. Finally have spells to spare. Where are you?" He replies, "Yeah, I’m okay. Got separated from the others, but alive. We got [[Nacrissa Thrudec]], not shabby! Staying underground for a bit, but I’ll see you soon."

[[Hugh|Finn]] casts Word of Recall in the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] house, in case of emergency. 

We tell [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], and [[Trisha]] the overview of our learnings on [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]], [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]], the tie-ins to the [[Fire Raisers]], and the mysterious island - which apparently seems to be a big hubbub right now, the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] seems to be planning an expedition, and [[Trisha]] may join us for an intro to [[Eirian|E]]. They're very surprised that the [[Wayfinders]] are involved in this conspiracy, including [[Kith and Kin]]. We share that the [[Duvey Family]] is definitely involved. We mention the gods being afraid and recruiting us to resurrect people, namely [[Bahamut]], [[Pelor]], [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]].

[[Costi]] brings up [[The Curator]], but [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] has forgotten their whole conversation. [[Hugh|Finn]] spots a tiny flicker of [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] eyeing [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]. She clarifies who in [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is involved with [[The Curator]]. We talk about [[Zormvrik]] and the [[The City of Endless Night]], and say that info on [[New Fairhaven]]. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] gets called away, and [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] says we should stop bringing up [[The Curator]], that it will just eat up time we don't have. [[Freya]] asks for permission to talk about it, and [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] has the rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] leave with [[Trisha]].

[[Freya]] shares about [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s previous threats, and confesses that she put a marble in their house. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] says it was something she stopped doing. She's been a part of [[The Collection]] for a very long time - beginning when she and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] were at [[Redscale]]. [[Sidwell]]. She had a daughter by him, and was forced into work to try and provide for them, [[The Curator]] offered to care for her daughter [[Adelphia]]. Then she met [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]. The only tasks she's ever done, are to put a [[Curator Blue Marble]] near his [[Raven Queen Sanctuary]] once every 10 years. She's tried to tell him hundreds of times. [[Sienna Burbank]] decided was done, and didn't put the last marble. She finally told him, thinking it would last, and yet he forgot again. She still doesn't know where [[Adelphia]] is, [[The Curator]] says she's doing well. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] confirms that [[Trisha]] knows, but [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] doesn't. She warns, they will always be helpful, and there will always be a cost. She also has a desecrated spot too. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]], "Heard about losses, how many are left? [[ELA]] still active? Anything we can do?", he replies, "Bad. At least 600 dead. Another 250 captured. 130 scattered. [[Jezeten]] [[ELA]] finished, joining [[Bihor Region]] cells. You did well though, you did [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] or [[Nacrissa Thrudec]]?"

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Giary]], "Nice job on [[Nacrissa Thrudec]]!!! You with [[Terrav]] and [[Niko]] and [[Zephyra]]? Everyone okay? What's y'alls plan next? We're going to [[Thelran Asari]]! [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] still here.", he replies, "Hell yeah! It was AWESOME! With [[Niko]] and [[Zephyra]], [[Terrav]] separated but we’re gonna get him later. Not sure! Killing another Duke? Or [[Thelran Asari]]"

[[Freya]] shares about her conversation with [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]. It turns into a rehash of the same conversation we've had before, though [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Rez]], and [[Costi]] fess up about the [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]] chain being confirmed as [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] and not [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]. [[Freya]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] have a tense agreement to try and talk more kindly to each other. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] casts Legends Lore to try to learn more about [[Synchrona]], the incense fills the room, and as we look around we thick clouds of incense move with a pattern, pulling apart and rotating on axes around each other, coming closer together until they meet. A light airy voice, calm and gentle, says -

"On this plane, there are places where the veil between the primal is paper thin. A child born in one of these places at a moment of perfect elemental synchronicity is [[Synchrona]] (plural), and within it lies a physical manifestation of the [[Prime Material]] and a potent power over the planes."

Rereading through the [[The Unnatural Naturality]], it confirms perfect synchronicity is very rare, and often only last for a few minutes: [[Plane of Fire]], [[Elemental Plane of Air]], [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], [[Elemental Plane of Water]]. 

[[Freya]] sendings to [[Rawley]], "Hi, going to TA early, like idk, 2-3 weeks? Will anyone be there then? Please please please be there then.", he replies, "Hey there Freya, I'm planning there about 2 weeks early, i've got some business to take care of, come find me first thing". 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Magister]], "Three weeks still the timeline for arrival in [[Jezeten]]? Or would it be earlier?", he replies, "Yes, that’s when we’re aiming to arrive!"

[[Freya]] sendings to [[Rawley]], again, "RAWLEY WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW I LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT ME AND THE [[Planes of existence]] AND MY OTHER NAME AND WE NEED TO TALK NOW", he replies, "Freya, I'm sorry but that just isn't how this works. I can't share anything else until we're in the right place, together. Share more soon."

[[Costi]] gets a very expensive ivory statute made of himself.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] creates a daily performance to share solace through music in the park, playing harp. 

[[Freya]] spends a lot of time messing with various elements, nothing really happens but she does feel more, connected? We plan for her to talk to [[Zmaj]].

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Marius Lupu]], "Hello, checking in, [[Costi]] would like to know if you're alive" "Glad you care so much [[Hugh|Finn]], okay, been better, on the road to [[New Fairhaven]], hear there's a [[Duke v'Bihor]] who needs stabbing". 

The next morning, a piece of paper with a C on the outside arrives in code, breaking it, it reads, "warning you that [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] reportedly saw [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] on the [[Night of Storms]]. He's formally accused her of being a member of the [[ELA]], and implies it's put more focus on [[Costi]]" 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]], "You were seen by [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]. Officially investigating you and [[Costi]]. Don’t come home. Heading to [[Thelran Asari]] 3 weeks. We’ll protect [[Nadia]]. Need to communicate. Dream?"

She replies, "I can’t do that, but we’re outside the city. Thought we were safe. We’ll stay gone, to [[New Fairhaven]]. Please check on [[Nadia]] when you’re there.", [[Hugh|Finn]] responds, "We killed [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. Bad timing for us. stay hidden. Please Don’t make bear bad news to [[Costi]]. Will connect you with friend. He’ll relay detail.", she replies, "We’re connecting with another cell, we’ll stay safe. You do the same."

[[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] and [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] return. There's a parade through the street, being dragged on his knees by a number of undead. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] doesn't sense any desecration on him, meaning he's likely not in [[The Collection]]. [[Freya]] however, does note that [[Colvia Ghul]] seems particularly warm to him, and while he seems surprised he doesn't rebuff her. 

We decide we should hang out with [[Trisha]] and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] before we leave, definitely as a group, not as a double date, though maybe that's what [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is suggesting? Is it? 

News breaks that over the week of mourning, the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] found the 5 [[ELA]] who were responsible for the death of [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] and will hang them for their crime. 

They save a space for us at the front, along with [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]], [[Trisha]], [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]], and [[Fingers]]. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] leads the prisoners along the stage, brought up by [[Colvia Ghul]]. We see 3 unknown fighters, one of the girls [[Costi]] kissed in passing the night before the [[Night of Storms]], and [[Terrav]]. 

[[Rez]] messages [[Terrav]] as he's led on stage, "[[Hugh|Finn]] is not watching, but I know he, and all of us, want you to know - what you've done mattered. I hope you find peace", he finds us in the crowd, and says, "Win". 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tells [[Hugh|Finn]] not to look up, to stay looking down, this will be a hard one. 

[[Trisha]] pulls [[Hugh|Finn]] aside, [[Rez]] warns her about his tie to [[Terrav]] as they go. 

On the walk home, [[Rez]] messages [[Giary]], "[[Giary]], I'm so sorry. [[Terrav]], he was captured and, well, he was hung. It was quick. We were there. Couldn't help, he messaged us 'Win'." He responds, "It sucks here. Glad you were there. We're gonna burn this fucking place to the ground. He was a great guy. The best of us."

[[Costi]] takes the burden, and tells [[Hugh|Finn]]. He struggles to believe it, and tries to send to him, but it doesn't go through. He goes into his room, shifts into battle mode, and takes his grief out on the walls around him. 

We have a conversation about [[Hugh|Finn]]'s dwindling drive to keep fighting, he's worried he's cursed to always lose who he loves - and what if that also means [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]? We tell him to sleep on it, we'll support him no matter what. But [[Hugh|Finn]] was the one to tell us how it is always worth it to love. And it won't always be this way?
