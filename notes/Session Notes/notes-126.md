# Detailed Notes: Session 126

We all begin to sprint up the stairs, [[Hugh|Finn]] catches a flash of lightning. 

Three blue half-dragons, a blue adult dragon, and a [[draconic]] which is similar but different from a half-dragon that has appeared in the last two hundred years from [[Gu’athrithen]]. It has 7 mounts.

Had bombs that were activated. Whispered something in draconic to [[Trisha]]. 

[[Samuel]] investigated and saw two dead bodies, and ?? 

[[Rez]] yells at the last surviving draconic, "If you're not going to survive you've should at least brag about why you were here!" and naturally, it's pretty persuasive, he responds, "You copper slut, ask your boss - tell them to get those *things* out of the wastes, we have what we need"

We all rush to our rooms to find the escape pods, grab all our shit, and hit the big red button to escape. After a super uncomfortable ride, we land in the middle of the woods - miles and miles away from [[Jezeten]]. 

[[Rez]] asks [[Trisha]], "Where are you? Y'all have really gotten yourselves in trouble. What did they take from you?? If something's wrong with [[Turian Waste]] we should know", she responds, she replies, "Pods to [[Jezeten]], Draconics broke your controls. Relates to mom’s work, undead in [[Turian Waste]], dragons blame [[Eberron]]. Not the plan, but could work for us."
