# Detailed Notes: Session 97

[[Freya]] works out, [[Hugh]] is interested in going to the stables and is escorted again by [[Private Hageth]]. They have 5 stables, some with normal horses, but also some with above ground and subterranean levels for flying and digging mounts, respectively. They meet a very large snake, who [[Hugh]] learns is ridden by [[Ligo]]. They also have a bullette, one of [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]]'s mounts. [[Hugh]] also sees some pegasus and griffons. Two of the stables are restricted. 

[[Costi]] and [[Rez]] go back to the library. [[Costi]] wants to look for unauthorized biographies about [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. There's a few that mention him, but nothing of substance. It's almost suspiciously absent from the library. [[Rez]] tries to look for any book that builds off her first find, but no luck. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] goes to visit the quartermaster, to learn a bit more about their typical undead detection techniques. [[Corporal Vilmose]] recognizes her on sight, and shares that he knows the bare minimum about our engagement. He does some work for the [[Bone Breakers]], he shares that bludgeoning damage is preferred and he can lend us some weapons, and they should be silvered or magical. He says [[Eberron]] has increased the boundaries of what souls and what beings can be made undead. They're rumored to have found a way to turn extra-planar beings into undead. He's also heard rumors the [[Eberronian Second Division]] might see full deployment in the next year. There's something he'd like to show us, but was told to wait until after [[Hugh]]'s procedure. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is able to convince him otherwise, he has some augmentations for [[SVN models]], namely a hand that can turn into a loaded crossbow or a blade, and can do more once integrated into a warforged. He also recommends we talk to [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]], and his division the [[Bone Breakers]] are an excellent fighting force. He gives us provisions to make it through and some potions: 2 of aid and 2 of heroism. 

We plan to have an evening with [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] and the [[Bone Breakers]]. He's accompanied by a slightly older gentleman that introduces himself as [[Walmond]], he's a lance corporal of the [[Bone Breakers]], he advises [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]]. Before joining, he studied at the [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]]. He's a historian and specializes in military strategy, especially martial history and religious history. He worked with [[Duke v'Luthei]] to crack down on religious sects, about 10 years ago when he first came to the country. He also spent around 5 years in a temple to [[Kelemvor]], which has made him adept at stopping undead. We talked about the role of religion in general, and it seems as though as long as it's not broad worship it's fine. 

They recommend we get the lay of the land of [[Viliki]] first, we will be distrusted as outsiders but won't be hampered or restricted by military reputations or limitations. Reports make it seem more run of the mill necromantic behavior than some of the higher-risk new breakthroughs. There are a few registered necromancers in [[Viliki]] that we can talk to, generally it is agreed among them that illegal necromancy hurts them. They must pay high taxes but gain some benefits too. [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] thinks that illegal practice is often a sign of distaste with current leadership or to strengthen private militias. 

We also learn that some in the [[Eberronian Military]] are granted license to gain power from other gods, as long as it's not part of organized religion and appropriately registered. The [[Burbanks]] petitioned the [[Three Dukes]], and commissioned [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] to consult on how to address the threat of the [[ELA]]. They ask us to share what we found most effective when they worked against the [[Fire Raisers]], as an initial guide. We'll get a monthly retainer, 50gp per person, per month to start. 

It seems like [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] is making this request pretty legitimately, and will be reviewed highly. It also seems like he's conveying himself more carefully around [[Walmond]], who we seem to think he's holding back about his past, intentionally dancing around something. We believe he believes our role in stopping the [[Fire Raisers]] without necessarily any irony. 

[[Walmond]] talks a bit more about his role with [[Kelemvor]], he finds comfort in the ending of things eventually. There's a subtle acknowledgment of [[Costi]]'s work with [[The Raven Queen]], but we're advise not to rub in any religious affiliations. We learn that [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] studied under [[Duke v'Luthei]]'s private tutors, reserved for children of high ranking military officials. [[Walmond]] prefers to prevent a fight, use information, and stop trouble before it gets to conflict. 

We share that we have killed a lich, but couldn't find it's phylactery, neither seemed to be aware of this. [[Costi]] asks about their public vs private libraries, but [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] leans away from that. Once they leave we recap the conversation and our mutual feeling there's more that wasn't said. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] prepares for her promised concert, she gets a little thrown by her memories of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] but still plays beautifully. We mingle with folks and then head to bed.

Before we go to sleep, [[Hugh]] shows [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] the blue flame he has, and shared a bit about how the gods seemed to also be impacted by her death. She asks if [[Hugh]] will scry on [[Darek Spout]] to check-in on him, he sees an eleven man who looks exceedingly similar to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sitting in front of a fire, holding hands with another elven man, both drinking a glass of wine. In front of them, two elven children are playing. Their surroundings look fine, not elaborate but normal. 

We start our travel to [[Viliki]]. There's barricades where ID's are checked every 8 miles, but lately there's been attacks by [[ELA]] to kill soldiers, steal weapons, and sometimes take hostages. It's a slow process but the roads seem very safe. 

On the way, we try to get to know [[Trisha]] better. As the big sister, she says she's always had to keep [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] out of trouble, he's a hot head but now has military outlets to keep him calm. We learn a bit about how [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] met at [[Redscale]]. The [[Burbank FIT]] was a long process to be approved, and meant both [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] and [[Trisha]] were educated in [[Eberron]]. She and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] discuss [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] but we can't get a clear read of her take. She sits on the [[Eberronian Second Court]], where the non-nobility meet. It's mostly a social and advisory role. 

[[Illana Bihor]] is the third daughter of [[Duke v'Bihor]], often helps [[Trisha]] access first court events. There's a man they dislike, [[Kabrohn]] who's trying to place his son in advantageous positions, they've foiled those attempts. [[Costi]] knew his son [[Kinth Kabron]] at [[AVAD]] who was a bully and a jerk. She says this disgrace, and what's upcoming in the next two months, might remove their family from power overall. We ask about [[Von]], and [[Trisha]] says his existence would be a dangerous rumor. 

A dwarven man with a bow across his back comes out of the woods and reports to [[Trisha]], who is a game warden, he's a guard who keeps eyes out for poachers and other illegal activity. They're not officially part of the [[Eberronian Military]], they look loosely for any threat to the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]'s property. We also learn she breeds and rides horses in her spare time. 

As we approach [[Viliki]], for [[Getting Freaky in Viliki]],  [[Trisha]] offers to talk our way in, and we decide to visit [[Mayor Galfeedz Drakurshire]] first. There's a small wall around the town, and a giant fountain in the center of [[Fendridad Square]], with a break in the walls overlooking the bay. A path cut into the stone goes up the mountain, with a large mansion 500 feet up.  

A half-orc in fine clothing approaches who we learn in [[Mayor Galfeedz Drakurshire]]. We head to his office in the [[Ratoucha]], which he says is essentially a town hall in [[Eberron]]. He's a former admiral in the [[Eberronian Military]], and developed a taste for foreign goods. He gives [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] each a writ of authority to give us legal protection while we investigate, but it requires us to give our blood. He says it will identify us and confirm who it was given to and by.

We get a room and staff in the [[Ratoucha]], and he recommends [[The Mountain's Kiss]] for our lodging. [[Mayor Galfeedz Drakurshire]] said he has seen another firbolg before, a red firbolg in the [[Tropics]], he points out the location on a map. [[Rez]] is vindicated! He'll provide some background, including the registered necromancers. He says the western side of town is more prone to crime, we can talk to [[Security Director Aldi]] there. He says it's mostly a residential area except the [[Founding Flagon]], an inn. 

He also suggests the [[Viliki Boneyard]], we should speak to [[Pooka]] the Gravetender. Things have been going missing, and they'll know more. [[Captain Kalorek Plunderov]] is also a good point, but he's delegated the investigation to his subordinates, we can get more information from them. 

For other potential leads, there's also the sole survivor of the caravan attack, she's staying at the [[Founding Flagon]]. She's from [[Mulfara]]. The town also supports a fishing guild with higher than usual mortality, we could talk to them. 370% more than is typical. He also said he'll provide a list of the townspeople who have gone missing or been killed. 

We head to [[The Mountain's Kiss]] and greet a halfling with a thick beard who helps us find a suite, with four rooms. We go downstairs to eat dinner, and scope out the other patrons. [[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] look for someone who seems to be grieving. They find a dragonborn with yellow green scales who clearly seems to be down. [[Rez]] goes and joins him in his grief-drinking in an attempt to get information, but gets a bit lost in her own feelings and instead starts grief-drinking of her own.

A young woman in her early/mid-twenties recognizes [[Costi]], it's [[Marina Alduchev]], a popular athlete a few years old than him at [[AVAD]]. He shares that we are contracting for the [[Burbanks]], and she wants to know if he's enlisted. It seems she's heard of his exploits in [[Arkhosia]]. She mentions a mutual friend that she used to date, [[Marius A]]. who works in [[Jezeten]] for the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. [[Marina Alduchev]] works for the mayor to help with some city planning. They ask if she's noticing anything, and she says she hasn't witnessed anything, she says not personally but she's been building a friendship with [[Garida]] offers to introduce us, she'll come by and meet us at our office in the [[Ratoucha]]. She also tells [[Costi]] that [[Marius Lupu]] left town shortly after he did, but no one has heard from in months. 

[[Rez]] eventually drinks enough to just start talking, then pauses and he starts talking about [[Etzel]]. He told her not to go out, that it was too slick, but she was surefooted and yet she slipped - she's never had a knot come untied before. She only went missing 2 days ago. It seems like the drinking is just a grief thing for him. As he leaves, a human woman in his late thirties watching him leave seems to size up. 

With a bad feeling, [[Rez]] tells the party. [[Costi]] sends an arcane eye to follow him and see if he's safe, while we watch the woman. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] divine senses and finds three undead, but they're all 'normal' workers. We decide to split up. [[Rez]] and [[Freya]] turn invisible and decide to follow him, in case something happens. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh]] decide to go talk to the suspicious woman. [[Costi]] follows him with his arcane eye, ready to jump in at the bar as needed. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh]] use a gambling game to watch the woman, we learn is named [[Shay]]. They don't notice anything at first, she's being evasive. She's a bureaucrat, works in payroll. She's been to [[New Fairhaven]] twice. As she leaves, [[Hugh]] sendings to [[Rez]] "the woman has left the building, she did not appear to do anything suspicious other than work on payroll".

Through the eye [[Costi]] watches as off to the side, two shadows, black robbed figures, one almost invisible and the other bumping into him, they come up behind him. They look back at something, then dart away. 

As [[Rez]] and [[Freya]] follow, she bumps into a door and spook him. He thinks someone is trying to rob him, and yelling throws coins out, then drops a dagger. [[Freya]] notices it has the initials "E.H." on it, and after looking to see if anyone is nearby picks it up. 

Meanwhile, [[Costi]] runs down to get [[Hugh]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. 

[[Rez]] and [[Freya]] get another sending telling them about the shades, and without better options they decide to split, [[Freya]] trying to track the shades and [[Rez]] following the dragonborn. 

From another alley, [[Rez]] sees two more figures. One halfling in leather armor and the other a taller elf moving super quietly. [[Rez]] kicks a pebble and scares them off, but it seems like they're just normal robbers. He enters into what we assume is home. [[Rez]] plants the dagger for him to find with some extra money. 

[[Freya]] is able to pick up the trail of the robes, but doesn't move too quietly in her excitement. After 45 seconds, it goes cold. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] eventually all comes back together and heads back to talk about our plan.
