# Detailed Notes: Session 108

[[Colvia Ghul]] and her team show up to our area, and [[Gizraf]] searches the area - noting the hole we found. We report the vial from the half-dead we found, and own up to the entire conflict. She says we should go in and investigate, she's let [[Dispek Dradleston]] know, and they'll look for more signs above.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] will go with [[Jamzik Zodevzo]], who's especially skilled in the underground. We chat about how to heal ourselves, and we talk through several options, but decide just to use up some diamonds - a few from [[Hugh|Finn]] and one that [[Freya]] just happens to find? 

We chat about how to heal ourselves, and we talk through several options, but decide just to use up some diamonds - a few from [[Hugh|Finn]] and one that [[Freya]] just happens to find? [[Freya]] and [[Rez]] get their skin patched up magically from [[Grizaf]], who studied at the [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]]. He's clearly a decently powerful caster. He also makes us a lantern that casts invisible light. 

As we catch our breath and recover some, [[Colvia Ghul]] interviews [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. She knows of her musical talent, death, affiliation for [[Corellon Larethian]] and is gaining skill with a sword, but she says she's more familiar with the rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. She specifically asks about our usual marching orders. We learn that they believe [[ELA]] has gone to "drastic measures" to negate the [[Eberronian Military]] forces. They discuss their effectiveness at recruiting, and discuss [[Marina Alduchev]]. They also claim they've been burning down towns, with very few survivors, in addition to attacking caravans and roadways. [[Colvia Ghul]] claims that all of her group happened to find each other from their military service who all follow [[Ioun]], and it hasn't been an impediment to them, as they don't hold services. 

Before we head on our expedition, they warn us not to take too long so we don't fall behind the other search groups. [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] gives [[Colvia Ghul]] some blood to aid in being supervised while far away. 

We begin our descent, but struggle as a group to be quiet. We also trigger a few traps, though they're not necessarily distinct in any way. We hear gibbering ahead, and [[Samuel]] is sent ahead to scout. He reports back, 10 humanoids that are smaller than us. We fought something similar, maybe frog people? They have some vials of black goo, and all of them have various weapons. They're doing work on more weapons at a large table, and being overseen by a yuan-ti. 

We try to discuss what to do, but as we're deciding the ceiling behind starts to collapse. In response, we rush into the room. 

We overcome several Kuo-Toa, and a yuan-ti overseeing them. It was surprisingly hard, and several of us got low in health but we survived in our usual way. After killing most of them, we tied up one kuo-toa and prepared to interrogate them... if we can find a way to communicate.
