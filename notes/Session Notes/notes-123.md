# Detailed Notes: Session 123

[[Costi]] looks at the spellbook from [[Olak]] with the [[Teld's Dogs]]: chromatic orb, frost fingers, blur, hold person, icingdeath's frost, lightning bolt, stinking cloud, banishment, wall of fire, storm sphere, cloudkill

We argue about what to do legend's lore, and then decide to do this on [[Mysterious Circles]]. The incense takes on a purple tint, and [[Hugh|Finn]] hears a calm reassuring voice, "these infinite overlapping circles are the eye of the [[Everpresent]]. It is the symbol of [[Morthos]] and denotes and individual object or place that is under their influence. Where goes the eye, there goes their power. It observes the degradation of our most natural and fundamental lines and is a harbringer of the greatest doom"

"Hi [[Rawley]], uhm crazy question. Did you send me letter? When I left [[Polaris]]. It had [[Wayfinders]] symbol so I assumed you, is it?", he responds, "No, [[Freya]]. I didn't send you a letter before I picked you up. Make sure you bring that with you when I see you next"

We talk through [[Freya]]'s history, since it seems like there's someone else who wanted her to find the [[Wayfinders]]. She shows us the letter she got, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] divines the letter but doesn't pick up anything. [[Freya]] suddenly brings up that she kept the holy symbol from [[Bagath Mizzragon]] from under [[Weirefesteria]], 

Secretly, [[Freya]] reaches out [[The Curator]] and asks if all desecrated things are the same? They say no. And following up, do you know all desecrated things? They again say no. Then deny a request to hang tonight. 

[[Rez]] sends to [[Samson]], "I'm [[Rez]]! Welcome!! You know my sister, [[Eirian|E]]! You sound so interesting, I have a bunch of questions but FIRST - can you tell me what you know about the [[Mysterious Circles]] and the guy you found dead? You heard him talk about them? You can tell me whatever you tell her!!!", he  replies: "[[Rez]], it is SO nice to met you! I’ve heard so much, YOU sound so interesting. I hope we get to meet soon! Shoot, that’s a lot to unpack. [[Lorvak Nestle]], bookseller in [[Thelran Asari]], looking for something for my daughter and found book with [[Mysterious Circles]]! Planned a coffee to talk, but he died before. Found his body, seemed murdered."

The group talks a bit about [[Rez's Family]], she mentions her older brother [[Lee]] is asking [[Bahamut]] what is wrong / how they can be helped. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] plays for the garden, and she notices the plants there seem to grow a bit quicker.

[[Hugh|Finn]] reaches out to [[TrueSilver]], asking for something to help us in [[Jezeten]] - the hearth goes out, and left in the center is a coal, veined through with silver. It hums with power, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] takes a closer look, it's consecrated it's a [[Coal of TrueSilver's Grace]] it can be smashed, destroying it, expending one use of destroy undead as though you were a 20th level cleric.

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] summons [[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] to his study. He has his contract, stating: [[Costi]] will be a lieutenant ambassador in [[Eberron]] diplomatic corps based out of the second division. the term will be four years, three of which are to be spent outside of [[Eberron]] under the tutelage of the other ambassadors in the corps. One year will be in [[Eberron]], though 9 months must be in his first two years. He will be paid a commission of 50gp a month, 20 of which are to be set aside for purchase of apartments in [[Jezeten]] upon completion of his junior ambassadorship. 

There's one for [[Hugh|Finn]] as well, inducting him into the diplomatic corps, as the Captain of [[Costi]]'s guard, responsible for his health and safety. Failing, and letting him come to harm is a capital offense, and will receive any punishments he does. He gets a stipend of 15gp a month, if [[Costi]] dies and it's determined Finn is not guilty, he is recirculated into the general [[Eberron]] military. It's backdated to the date we entered the country.

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] argue about whether [[Hugh|Finn]] should rejoin. [[Costi]] is afraid of more sacrifice on [[Hugh|Finn]]'s part, who argues he would be never forgiven by [[Costi's Dad]] if he didn't live up to his promise. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] also tells [[Costi]] he pulled strings, got him credit for "study abroad" and he's now graduated from [[AVAD]]. He's done! However, etiquette class starts immediately - he needs to learn a month's worth in the next seven days.

The classes culminate in an exam from [[Trisha]]: lunch, tea, then biscuit (the most difficult part). He passes with flying colors! They gossip after, [[Trisha]] challenging [[Costi]] to find someone at [[Fingers]] party to sleep with, and asking [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to cheer up [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]]. She asks about [[Rez]], doesn't say hi though. It's fine. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] confronts [[Costi]] after he lets it slip that [[Hugh|Finn]] resigned into the [[Eberronian Military]]. He asks her to help him remember that if he dies it's not just him on the line, and shares his worry about how long he's now obligated to be in [[Eberron]].

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] then goes and picks up her new armor, then heads to ask [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] if he'd help train and break in the new armor. [[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] also find uniforms for the [[Eberronian Military]], with a note on a "technically optional" beret included.

[[Freya]] is sparring with [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]], it's tense and also more intimate than normal.

[[Hugh|Finn]] goes to have dinner with [[Marigold]] at the [[Made Fors]] camp. She asks why he didn't share he was enlisting, but then confides she bet on it, and thinks he's doing the right thing. They discuss how they feel, of their father or creator, and her thanks for being alive and their resentment for how they're treated. She's never left [[Eberron]], and says she trusts [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] as much as she trusts anyone - she's never seen him do something that would change that. She's interested in seeing more of [[Ninarith]], once they're done here and warforged are freed. 

Asking if she's met [[Sven]], she says [[Hugh|Finn]] will - he's always excited to meet another [[SVN models]], he's "looking for family". He was friends with [[Lukan]]. She warns him to be really careful, he's looking for other warforged to join his mission, and treats organics really terribly. However, if [[Hugh|Finn]] is too mean to him, he'll try to break him down and hurt who he loves. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] goes to fight and flirt with [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]], getting used to her new armor. She learns he went to [[Redscale]] briefly, but didn't love it. Over steak, he shares that there's a family tradition in the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], that all the "Cliffords" do, that he hasn't quite accomplished yet.
