# Detailed Notes: Session 114

DO NOT GO ABOVE HALF-MAX HP BY END OF FIGHT

At the end of the fight, we noticed a group of 6 highly animalistic humanoids leave [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]'s tent. [[Hugh|Finn]] remembers that he had a group of favorites, excellent scouts, with an extremely vicious reputation known as [[Teld's Dogs]].

[[Fingers]] suggests we hide some bodies so that we hit the 10% quota, so we stick two bodies into [[My Hole]].
