# Detailed Notes: Session 115

Ending the encounter with a captive, we make our way into the center of camp along with [[Fingers]]. 

[[Major Teld]] is eating a meal when we arrive, and firstly inspects our wounds. We give our report, underplaying the number of assailants we fought. He brings his bone axe over to our captive, as a bony finger protrudes out and enters into his brain. [[Costi]] watches out for a possible future that doesn't reveal our mistake.

We're told we performed adequately and are given permission to heal, then are dismissed. We spend some time magically tending to our wounds, before bed. 

In the night, [[Hugh|Finn]] scries on one of the attendants that was just in [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]'s room. He's in a room with [[Fingers]] and [[Colvia Ghul]], our captive, and two additional captives. They're discussing numbers, but [[Colvia Ghul]] spots it, and they go silent until it's dropped. 

We talk about the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]] and [[Kith and Kin]], [[Bahamut]], [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Pelor]] are assisting/assisted by dragon/s. Also something is hidden and related to [[The Zumbinis]], but we know there's more to it we've yet to uncover.

Then, that afternoon [[Fingers]] comes over - they say they learn quite a bit that they consider reliable. We're told we'll leave in a week for the attack. [[Teld's Dogs]] brought a few additional [[ELA]] captives back. [[Lukan]] is still out, he leads the group. Nest step is to send scouting parties to [[Golstrava]], which we should expect to do. We offer to draw a map of what we saw: fortifications, the tunnel there, where we were taken. were also told to get rid of the bodies we hid asap. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks [[Fingers]] about [[Colvia Ghul]], confirming that she's on assignment from her boss. Her last role was with the [[Eberronian First Division]], she's not technically in the [[Eberronian Military]], she reports to the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] - she's in special intelligence. [[Fingers]] and [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] have been with the [[Eberronian Second Division]] their whole career with the [[Eberronian Military]]. [[Cliff Burbank]] put her in this division, even before the [[ELA]] was the target. 

[[Rez]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] go into [[My Hole]] and dissolve the two bodies with lots of acid from [[Rez]].

[[Rez]] asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to help with [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]] and to scry on [[Pleetos Alentas]] - he feels a rocking motion and sees dark water and a middle-aged half-elf with long dark hair in a ponytail to his middle shoulder blades. Quite handsome, green eyes, tanned, sitting on a stool built into the deck of a ship. The wood is characteristic of northern half of [[Ninarith]], probably [[Taleem]]. It's sunny but there's small waves. He wears a loose-fitting green tunic with gold embroidery and simple brown trousers. He carries a sword, and no visible grafted-scales. A young human man fills his wine glass wearing a blue and white serving uniform, short-sleeved outfit. He's reading a book, Two Weeks With the Lizardmen. His eyes suddenly flash red coloring and reptilian pupils. It seems to be moving in an unclear direction, changing multiple times.

Over the next 5 days, the [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]] plans their attack. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]:

[[Rez]] sends to [[Zmaj]], and [[Father Thronestone]] "Update on [[Burru Ilp]]'s notes? It's really important so please tell me yes and as much as you can. Tell [[Divitston Goldstone]] hi - I LOVE the necklace". He replies, "Progress is coming along slowly, but unfortunately not a great deal to share yet. Hopefully when you're next in [[Jalantar]] I'll have more!" Ugh.

**[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Magister]] to coordinate a dream visit** 

[[Hugh|Finn]] scrys on [[Ronan]], but it doesn't work. [[Freya]] casts sending any way,  "Hey! Are you in [[Polaris]]? Are you looking for me, beyond just asking me where I am? You suck, I hate you. Boooooo". He replies, "Yes, I deserved that. Yes, I am in [[Polaris]]. No, I am not looking for you. Can we actually talk? I'm sorry" after she shares a cigar with [[Rez]] and gossips.

[[Hugh|Finn]] sending [[Marigold]], "Wanted to say hello. I was very focused on myself during our last conversation. When I’m in compound looking forward to listening. Stay safe, [[Hugh|Finn]]." She replies, "You had a lot to talk about! But I’ve got plenty to say, too. Buckle up."

**We study [[Kith and Kin]] and have a break through - *later***

[[Costi]] thinks about how to slow down the army, aims for process bottle necks. [[Rez]] helps look for ways to fuck things up. We decide for him to alter self into a [[ELA]] member, [[Rez]] make him invisible, then take poison to the camp's central cistern. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Devkorus Kaa|Dev]], "[[Golstrava]] attack - 3 days time, multiple advance search groups beforehand. Send to us, communication dangerous. Any asks for the attack? We will be maintaining cover." He replies, "[[Tyros]] will be contacting you going forward, daily at 11:00 and 9:00. We'll have detailed requests later, for now information on advance groups helpful, and anything else on troop movements."

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talks to [[Costi]] about how successfully he's been handling our infiltration here, and keeping his cover. He says he's been dodging [[Eberron]] rules his whole life. Plus, he knows things are worse for other here than him. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] does a divination, how can we best incapacitate the army, without indicating it's us, to prevent loss of life. He burns a black snake skin to the hearth. The skin hits the fire and as it does, it moves, sliding out of the flame as a winding tendril of fire becomes blue and a green wave runs down. [[Rez]] asks if he'll do that about the gods and dragon clue in [[Kith and Kin]].

[[Costi]] sends to an [[ELA]] sympathetic professor for recommendations for poison/venomous animals he could polymorph into. "Professor! Please help me with my book. Need poison from common animal that would last and debilitate but not kill. Must persist in water." He replies, "[[Costi|Constantine]], did you finally learn to read? So proud of you. Yes, the Purple Eberronian Tree Frog. Oil based poison on skin, should work. Excited to read."

[[Freya]] asks [[Guu]] how to best do this. He tries very hard to hold a knife. [[Costi]] polymorphs himself and [[Freya]] collects the poison. The two frogs compete on who can get the most pets, while traumatizing [[Costi]] to scare more poison out of him.

On the second night, [[Fingers]] comes to our camp with a jug of wine. She recommends Liar's Dice, [[Rez]] is out first. [[Costi]] wins.

The next day, we spend a period of time scheming on how to poison the cistern. [[Rez]] creates a vest with a bladder and a tear away for the beak. [[Rez]] turns into a bird, puts it on, and the [[Rez]] makes him invisible. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] inspire herself, and [[Hugh|Finn]] makes her better at moving carefully. 

She monitors above the cistern, waits for the casters to come and start creating water, then dives down and tries to quickly break her flying path quietly. She barely brushes his neck with her wing, she struggles with the rip cord, and spills a little bit of liquid. The caster is suspicious and ALMOST catches her, but [[Costi]] flips to a new reality and she gets away. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] go talk to [[Colvia Ghul]]. She asks for the spell components to cast Legends Lore on her sword, because of her tie to [[Corellon Larethian]] and asks for payment in the form of whatever she learns from the spell. 

That evening, a young man named [[Mastan]] comes and invites [[Costi]] for dinner, saying they have "things in common". They join a half-orc woman named [[Dolfra]], who he seems to be romantic with. This is their first combat and campaign with the military. She's from the [[Narathian Plains]], and took a bad loan that meant they had to close their store and sign up. He’s from [[Jezeten]] and knows a lot about [[Costi]] (like that his parents taught at AVAD). His mom was an [[ELA]] sympathizer and confides in [[Costi]] about how hard it is to try and overcome. They agree good can be there, even when you disagree on their actions. He asks how [[Costi]] copes with the violence, he says remember there are not innocents in this - everyone here is ready and willing to die for their cause. There's more than this war, and focusing on the bigger picture can help. Or drink too much when people aren't watching. # alcoholism and compartmentalization. He ends the conversation by saying when this is over, maybe he can help him out re-opening up a bakery.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] heals herself, offers to heal [[Fingers]], who is fine but says they should check on [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]. Uh-oh. She heals him... not in time.

[[Freya]], [[Costi]], and [[Rez]] have a bad night, for the cause. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] watches out. They all wake exhausted.

[[Hugh|Finn]] gets visited in a dream by [[Magister]]. They talk about his reawakening and how to cope. [[Hugh|Finn]] shares abou teld and the biological warfare - magister admits to giving Vask the poison for Adrienne. They talk about marogold and the made fors, Finn share his hesitation to join. Magister gives him the vote of confidence. They talk about the procedure and the idol of bane found inside him. When Finn shares how many times he was reset, magister breaks a little. [[Magister]] talked about it being good that [[Hugh|Finn]] is making the society they built crumble. Unclear if he's talking about just [[Eberron]]  or broader humanity and "biologics". He consoles [[Hugh|Finn]] that he has the advantage of time on his side - they can do what's needed however long it takes to rebuild society.

[[Vask]] apparently "took a tumble from the airship" - they say he grabbed a flying potion and jumped from the airship. Was gone for 4 days, but wouldn't say more. Told [[The Silver Halves]] they shouldn't go to [[Zalev]] for a while, and asked everyone not to tell [[Rez]]. That can't be good.

[[The Silver Halves]] are planning to be in [[New Fairhaven]] in a few weeks, maybe months, for a traders conference with [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and "Bultikan" (name approximation), who has something she is interested in that could give her insight into how better utilize her abilities. [[Hugh|Finn]] references [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]] and says that [[Mhrhaal]] is there. [[Magister]] seems intrigued. 

They also discuss [[Cliff Burbank|Colonel Burbank]], with [[Hugh|Finn]] asking [[Magister]]'s opinion of him - he says he doesn't know [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] well but has heard good things. That he's treated warforged better than anyone aside from [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and [[Costi]], but he should trust his read and the read of those he cares about. 

[[Hugh|Finn]], "I slept with Rez." Left a good review but says she's not his type. [[Magister]] asks if [[Marigold]] is of any interest, and [[Hugh|Finn]] says she views him more as a sibling.
