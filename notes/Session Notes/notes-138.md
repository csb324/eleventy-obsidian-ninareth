# Detailed Notes: Session 138

We travel over a few days and decide to make camp in one of the barracks on the border of the [[Turian Waste]]. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] scries on a few people as we travel:

[[Wyn Elreal]] (who [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sends to have him intentionally fail), who says [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] found something in him he thought he'd lost. When [[Hugh|Finn]] scries, he's sitting at circular table, with two others, an older dwarf with salt and pepper beard (emphasis on the salt) with thick arms and an elven woman who looks a bit younger, fair and slender. They're clearly friendly with each other, though it's a touch strained - like those that were once close and are no longer. He's wearing a blue rose around his neck. 

[[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] fails

[[Costi]] sends to [[Henrik]], "Hey, checking in. How fair [[The Listeners]]? Anything new re [[Fire Raisers]]? Anything else notable happening in the city? Also, I’m an ambassador now so…", he replies, "Congratulations, [[Costi]]! Lead on [[Relakas]], likely in [[Eberron]]. Should have heads upped you there… Interesting reforms coming, as ambassador I should brief you! Visit soon?" 

We discuss what we remembered of [[Relakas]]: his ties to the [[Fire Raisers]], killing [[Ricci Scrucks]], and most importantly now, his ties to [[Winifey]] and how [[Jade]]'s flashed ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]). Glad [[Costi]] learned that teleportation circle to the [[Suncrest Palace]]. 

We decide we should also try to check in on [[Relakas]], the disco ball stops on him sitting alone in a nice room, that seems utilitarian, but seems distinctly in [[Eberron]]. He has a sword leaning against the table, that's of [[Eberronian Military]] make.  

[[Rez]] sends to [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], "Hi!! Thanks for the diamonds. Didn't need them but you never know. How's the inventing going? Still got that earth plane rift? Just curious." He replies, "Excellent! Earth plane diamond has fueled a FASCINATING energy magnifier I’ve used to improve robot. It has lasers now! Yep, have that rift, it ROCKS, ha!"

That seems important. We talk about what that means, and if the diamond from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] we got from [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] could magnify our stuff. [[Costi]] finds that it has a faint aura that is unique, however it seems like it is acclimating. We decide to check again in a few days as we get closer to the source. [[Rez]] asks for details "hahahaha, good one. Oh cooool! How'd you do that? Won't make any robots but could be neat to magnify some of our spells or stuff!", he replies, "It takes some SERIOUS doing. You’d need a chassis, a number of other reagents. I could teach if you spent a few months with me!" check again in a few days as we get closer to the source. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Willow]], "[[Finn]] for [[Adrienne]]. heading to [[Turian Waste]] to handle undead. Anything you think WE should know? About the wastes specifically. No randomness please. It hurts me" he replies, "Going now? That’s fine, but be out in two weeks! Not sure why! Also, bring me back six ounces of dust! Sorry I hurt you!"

We also try [[Pleetos Alentas]], he's sitting in a garden, but [[Hugh|Finn]] doesn't recognize the flora, it's not tropical or [[Eberron]] or [[Dilandil]] -- when described to us it sounds like the [[Narathian Plains]] He's writing a letter, he can't see it all, but it seems as though he's writing orders, and sees it's addressed to [[Bhula Orbnose]], which [[Hugh|Finn]] believes to be a halfling name, and sees that they live in [[Durmask]], [[Hugh|Finn]] gets the street name and most of the number "X23 STREET NAME". He sends the letter at the end of the vision. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] scries on [[Elena]], who is with a couple other students, walking close to [[AVAD]]. She arrives, nervously, at a door in [[Deal 'Ras]], in the Components. The door is opened by [[Everlynd]], who is alive but with a black eye. She closes the door in [[Elena]]'s face. She leaves a canvas bag by the door, inside which are some letters, one addressed to [[Mara]].

[[Freya]] asks if [[The Curator]] will visit tonight, they say yes. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to play a song on her harp inspired by them.

[[Rez]] sends to some of her siblings. 

[[Costi]] reads [[Kith and Kin]] and works on those final puzzles. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]], "Worried about [[Elena]]. Something seems off. Scryed on her, intuition says she is risky. Anyone free to watch her? At minimum needs friend" she replies, "Yes, I think she was close to some of the protesters. Someone can keep an eye on her."

We play drinking games, [[Costi]] asks [[Freya]] to pick between never having been arrested, or having all the answers. She decides answers now, though its hard. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to reflect on [[Hugh]], he does not miss nor regret the version he was. We reflect on his age a bit, and resolve to talk more about it with [[Magister]]. [[Freya]] asks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] if she wears more blue because of [[Corellon Larethian]] and it's just become what she's created as a personal brand now. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] starts a line of questions on [[Rez's Family]]. [[Rez]] asks [[Costi]] why he made a face about his mom, and he shares his ask for her not to fight. [[Hugh|Finn]] asks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] her primary purpose in life, and she says fix whatever she's been brought back here to fix. We talk a bit about the desire or reasons to fall in love. 

We end our night of fun with a game of "would you rather" but it's only about sex. It ends with [[Costi]] asking [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] if she'd rather have sex with [[Rez]] or [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] -- and she says [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]!!! [[Rez]] is SO offended. We debate if you can fuck you friends or not, and how trying to stop an army of undead factors into that anyway. [[Rez]] is very pro, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is very against. [[Rez]] storms off

[[Hugh|Finn]] comes out to talk to [[Rez]] and tells her that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s face has given her away and she has a crush on someone in the group. [[Rez]] is gleeful. it's got to be her right? it's her. [[Hugh|Finn]] confirms. He says [[Rez]] shouldn't tease her, she's easily spooked. [[Rez]] says that's what makes it fun. They seem to take different sides on this, [[Hugh|Finn]] is very baffled by [[Rez]]'s nonchalance but she is clearly excited. 

[[The Curator]] visits [[Freya]], who asks how old they are, they say they wish they remembered. They remind [[Freya]] that the only information they can access is that the collection can get, and they're still working to get anything more specific. They say it's seems as though not everyone in [[Polaris]] cannot be trusted - [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]] was given to her by one of the [[Keepers]]. [[Freya]] is very confused. Why would they put the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]? Maybe it's because they wanted her to be warned. [[The Curator]] can only confirm that [[Freya]] has a friend in the [[Keepers]]. These things take time, but they warned [[Polaris]] is not a safe place for her. [[Freya]] says the only one who could make sense is [[Dahana]], who helped raise her. She tries to think who else this could be or what it means. [[The Curator]] warns that it was only a few weeks ago the group of hunters from [[Polaris]] came after her. However, whatever happened there is complex. They counsel to have caution and have faith in [[Rawley]]. They are not the same being as any mortal, anywhere, in the multi-verse. [[Freya]] asks if they're their own kind of thing, and they say they're not unique entirely. [[Freya]] asks for any freebies about what we'll see in the [[Turian Waste]] - they say no, but to check-in once we're done.
