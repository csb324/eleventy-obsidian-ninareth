Notes 129 Chelsea Version

[[Freya]] had [[The Curator]] immediately reach out as we left the abandoned fortress. Asking what happened, [[Freya]] gave an exact play by play of the descent, puzzle, and then the chains fight. She asks them to come visit later because she has some questions. 

We then find a safe place to catch our breathes. 

[[Trisha]] reaches out to [[Costi]] asking, "What happened in the [[blacksite]]? As much detail as possible in twenty five words, please." [[Costi]]: "Used replica of [[Hugh|Finn]]'s finger to enter. Fought, killed 2 warforged guards, 3 constructs, 3 zombies (one big). Cut 37, 47, 222, 135, 136, 137." [[Trisha]]: "Understood. Stay where you are, in twenty minutes you’ll feel a slight pressure on your mind. Let it through, sending experts. Do what they say." [[Costi]]: "Should we go back and destroy further evidence of our presence?" [[Trisha]]: "I recommend you stay exactly where you are and do exactly what the experts say."

He then asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to join him to go and destroy the mouths of the guards we killed, so they cannot give information on [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] even in death, but the group starts to second guess using [[Hugh|Finn]]'s finger to access the site. [[Trisha]] counsels we do not move, so we wait it out. 

Two people appear from a nearby tree, a portly dwarf with a thick white beard and breads looped with gold rings [[Clarence the Cleaner]], and beside him is a tall wood elf woman wearing [[Gia'Thoren]] armor named [[Molly]] (we later learn she left the [[Gia'Thoren]] about 17 years ago). They charge us half price, courtesy of help from [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], 11,000 GP. We ask for future help, as an option, but get no commitments. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to explain what can be shared, leaves out [[The Curator]], but does give a thorough explanation on how to reach the innermost [[blacksite]] at [[Fort Studtrodd]]. Interestingly, he gives credit to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] as a quick thinker who came up with this plan. He offers no details on how he plans to conduct the clean up, though he and [[Molly]] discuss options:

[[Clarence the Cleaner]]: "We could probably [[Gauthoc]]?"
[[Molly]]: "We've been cultivating that for so long. Will he do it?"
[[Clarence the Cleaner]]: "He will for what we pay him! For the collar, [[Jathya]]? She's got that card game..." Then they move to chat further out of earshot. [[Clarence the Cleaner]] comes back and assures us that he has it handled. We sleep.

Later that night [[Molly]] uses a scroll to do another transport via plants, then brings through four bound captives, each a blue [[draconic]], with a different [[draconic]] pulling the disc they float on. This is [[Gauthoc]]. They have a heated conversation, until [[Clarence the Cleaner]] pays [[Gauthoc]] around 300 gold, then it turns familiar and jovial. They play cards, [[Gauthoc]] inviting [[Hugh|Finn]], who was the only one from [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] awake, to the game. 

[[Molly]] uses yet another scroll to bring an [[Arkhosia]]n women, with two bound and blindfolded people behind her. One of the younger humans on the disc, a brown haired fit man, looks familiar to [[Hugh|Finn]] - though he can't place him. He asks [[Clarence the Cleaner]] who they are, he describes them as "the mop", then asks [[Jathya]] their names after paying her similarly: a green and blue dragon born named [[Zukrad]] and the other is [[Jed Nantos]], someone [[Costi]] met through [[Henrik]] as an up and coming member of [[The Listeners]]. Clearly they're making a play that [[Arkhosia]] and [[Gu’athrithen]] are attacking the [[Eberronian Military]].

[[Rez]] is briefly woken to make another [[Finn finger]], then sent back to sleep lacking a sweet forehead kiss. The group all heads into [[Fort Studtrodd]]. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] wakes to join watch and [[Hugh|Finn]] shares what he saw, though passive aggressively doubts if she'll care. They agree it's very unfortunate what is happening, but make no effort to change it. 

[[Clarence the Cleaner]] mentions owning a ship, the kind by sea, and says [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] should look him up if we're ever in the [[Copper Cove]], a pirate island off the coast of [[The Tendrils]]. We got a [[Clarence the Cleaner Card]]. Which sends him a request for cleaning when we rip it in half, price negotiated after accessing the situation. 

He offered us items, and we got everything at 5% above cost but were warned future costs would be higher. We buy healing potions: 1 supreme (held by who?), 5 superior and 10 greater. We also buy X potions of necrotic resistance. The also got scrolls: 2 featherfall and 1 counterspell. He also gives us a card to do further sales, if we're interested. 

He's generous, but maybe that means we got taken advantage of on price? He mentions that our gold will cover the next two weeks, and boy to we spend some additional money with him.

[[The Curator]] visits [[Freya]] who accused them of not being honest with them - and [[The Curator]] played it off, claiming to be honest but also saying there's faith in [[Freya]] to figure it out, and they don't know everything. [[Freya]] confides that she doesn't need [[The Curator]] to care about her, but also doesn't know if [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] does either - and she doesn't have anyone else. [[The Curator]] gives decent advice, saying we all risk our lives for each other but it's not fair to expect everyone to give up their pre-existing relationship. [[Freya]] wonders why she doesn't have any of those herself.

Turning the conversation around, [[The Curator]] promises answers on [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]] to [[Freya]], and asks for another week to confirm real information on who sent it rather than a guess. They then give [[Freya]] a 3 charge boon. A charge lets her reroll a d20 roll after she knows the result or add 5 to a roll. [[Freya]] sends a prank to [[Jade]] through a meaningless book of gibberish code, "Find the Humebroxies 7th Edition".

[[The Curator]] also visits [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to break up with her, citing a lack of something they thought they saw. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tried to keep the door open noncommittally, but was asked to take a leap of faith and agree to an unknown ask. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] agrees to be broken up with instead.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] discusses the clean up operation - weighing our lives saved, the lives we freed from [[Orzudan]], versus the lives that got scapegoated. It devolves into an argument about [[The Curator]], again. [[Freya]] shares that if she wants a future, a family, or a home then she has to take these risks to get answers through [[The Curator]]. [[Costi]] points out the risks aren't just her own, they're to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] but also to random others who are getting hurt. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] says [[Freya]]'s actions get us answers to a bigger issue, the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Mysterious Circles]] and [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]. But [[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] say that's not her motivation. [[Hugh|Finn]] pushes her to have patience, and reminds her that she is important to us, she is family, and if the only option she's giving [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] to not be involved is to let her die, than that is not an option he can accept. 

[[Freya]] doesn't feel like family, and says [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] cares about her because of what she offers us. She feels like she gets to know what happened to her. She gets to try to have her own family, because unlike the rest of us, there's no one for her to turn to. She has to take care of herself - and if that makes her a bad person then fine. She asks [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] to be considerate of that, but if we're family then it's not what she thought because she's only felt hurt and used. 

[[Costi]] says he disagrees with everything she said, especially that she doesn't feel like [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] hasn't supported her, by so much, that he needs time before he can continue to talk about it. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] says that she thinks this, the fucked up-ness, is what family is like. No one wants to see her get hurt, or get too deep in a situation she can't get out of - she knows what it's like to be indebted to someone that seems like they can offer you everything. 

[[Freya]] says not knowing why everyone she thought cared about her could just throw her away hurts more than any other ramification. She carries this, even if it doesn't seem like it, and she's not ready to let it go yet. She won't stop working with [[The Curator]], and if that means she needs to do everything alone she will. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks for her to at least keep her in the loop, and says we can't know the consequences of everything in advance, we can only try to weigh the risks.
