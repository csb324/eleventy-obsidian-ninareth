# Detailed Notes: Session 106

Before bed, [[Costi]] sends to [[Costi's mom]], "[[Hugh]]'s brain repaired. He's old. Remembers Dad clearly, Dad said 'raise a stone in Klendon Glade'. I think he's gone mom", she responds, "Did [[Hugh]] remember his exact words? Was there more context? Follow up tomorrow"

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Magister]], "Memories back. Iâ€™m 287 years old. I cannot take the drug for fear of dying. Would love to speak soon", he responds, "Don't put yourself in any risk, but I'm so happy for you. We'll talk soon, I'm sure I have much to learn. Congratulations"

The next morning, [[Freya]] asks [[Hugh|Finn]] if he'd like to go train with [[Ligo]] and the [[Made Fors]]. But on the way we stop by the Quartermaster. He's excited to hear about [[Hugh|Finn]]'s progress, and says that [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] and [[Ligo]] put this new weapon together. It's a hand that can convert into a small crossbow, that feeds automatically 20 bolts per day. [[Hugh|Finn]] agrees to get it installed, and we watch in mild horror as he chops off his hand to then take an hour to add on the new hand. It's a little stiff, but seems like [[Hugh|Finn]] will learn to use it over time, though has no trouble bulls-eyeing a target on his first go. 

The [[Made Fors]] welcome [[Hugh|Finn]] and "his friends", and [[Ligo]] is down to train but suggests a two-by-two, [[Freya]] and [[Costi]] against [[Ligo]] and [[Hall]]. [[Marigold]] joins [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Rez]] to watch. It's a good fight, [[Costi|Cost-ape]] made a strong but brief appearance, but ultimately the [[Made Fors]] came out on top. 

[[Marigold]] says [[Hugh|Finn]]'s welcome party will be at the [[Made Fors]] headquarters, but we learn she's not technically a part of them - blood grosses her out. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is welcome to the after party once it's done. 

We mention we might be leaving the [[Burbank Compound]] for [[New Fairhaven]], and invite [[Ligo]] - but the [[Made Fors]] might be leaving out soon, he can't say more. [[Rez]] asks if that has anything to do with [[Grishomec Teld]]'s [[Eberronian Seventh Brigade]], and he makes it clear it does (unofficially). [[Ligo]] says warforged don't fair well in [[New Fairhaven]], he should either officially join the military or more effectively masquerade as property. He warns [[Duke v'Bihor]] and his family aren't known to be kind or generous to foreigners. 

We chat with [[Marigold]], and after some questioning if organics find it inconvenient to deal with our bodies, she latches on to the tidbit that "[[Adrienne Spout]] is extra bad at pooping". It seems to catch on. 

The remind us of the party, [[Ligo]] and [[Freya]] start having some vibes, and he asks us to help him keep his reputation and not share that we're invited around - he needs to be scary to organics. 

We head back to our rooms for a short rest, and send a note to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] that we'd like to discuss [[Hugh|Finn]]'s updates. He invites us to his private study, and has a board of increasingly stinky cheeses laid out. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] discuss how his adjustment after the procedure is going. [[Hugh|Finn]] shares the emotional weight is hardest to bear, and asks for help identifying some people from his visions. He glances through some images, naming: [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], [[Eva Sidorev]], who's been wanted as a deserter from the [[Eberronian Military]] for several years. She successfully evaded capture, and is still considered missing. There are suspicions she's living under an assumed name in either [[Durmask]] or [[Thelran Asari]], his team believes it might be [[Ugrid]]. He says she was ill, or had physical impairments when she was with them, so he assumes she's probably dead and they might as well write it off. He only started to dig up information on her when [[Hugh|Finn]] agreed to the procedure. 

The third from [[Hugh|Finn]]'s memory is [[Lister Scraxt]], a retired trainer in [[Eberron City]] in one of the veteran houses. He's also older, close to 90 now. [[Hugh|Finn]] remembers him as very kind but intense, and a stalwart companion on the battlefield. There was a lot of bloodshed during that time. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] offers to let [[Lister]] know [[Hugh|Finn]] is back. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] does not recall the gnome. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says, while we're under no obligation to work with him, he has some thoughts on things we can do to improve [[Eberron]]. [[Grishomec Teld]] will be heading on a mission soon - [[Nicky]] had mention that there are some [[ELA]] camps southwest of here, seemingly scattered in the woods. [[Major Teld]] requested to lead the mission, and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] shares it was his men who prevented him from escaping. [[Costi]] seems to read something between the lines here. 

As [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is experts on infiltration, he asks we get involved. [[Grishomec Teld]] is an "excellent field leader", but [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says they have different perspectives, and he can be prone to "excesses". He says he'd authorize us to, in some ways, speak with his voice and access any information he has. We bring up what he learned from [[Nicky]] and [[Marina Alduchev]], and pry a little there. He laments that she must've truly wanted to help, but says she must've been misguided. We can't fully decipher what that means.

He "opens up" that he wants as few [[Eberron]] citizens to die in his field operations as possible. When we ask if that applies to traitors too, he says exactly the traitors and not a one more - trials instead of field executions. He gives us three or four days to decide. 

He warns us that [[New Fairhaven]] is much crueler. He says [[Costi]] should remove all signs of his religion, and that he could not necessarily protect us as contractors but he could give us orders if we officially joined. We try to get some clarification on what it would mean to fully enlist. He reminds [[Costi]] of the compulsory service, and if he's planning something different to be out of the country at that point. If [[Costi]] signs, he'd be a junior Captain overseeing the rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], and [[Hugh]] could be part of the [[Made Fors]]. He offers if he'd like to start the [[Beating Heart Battalion]] up again. [[Hugh|Finn]] asks what his status is with the [[Eberronian Military]]. He's currently dishonorably discharged, though it's tricky because not all of them say there's enough mental capacity - though that's changing (perhaps thanks to / at the fault of [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]). [[Costi]] asks what his time requirements would be, and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says they'd figure that out - there's significant outreach internationally they could leverage, maybe he could be in the diplomatic corps. 

We ask that if we need a [[Eberronian Military]] escort, and we know [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] is very specialized on dealing with undead, that there might be some there he could help with. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says potentially, he's busy dealing with flameskulls in [[Jezeten]]. Rather, [[Trisha]] is good friends with [[Duke v'Bihor]] oldest daughter [[Illana Bihor]], so she might be a better escort. 

He mentions that he can ask around about [[Von]], and the more time we delay heading out the more information he can try to dig up. 

As we head out, he pauses with [[Freya]] a moment and says "we're good". [[Hugh|Finn]] casts a sending to him as we go. 

We head back to our room to discuss. We talk about [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s offer of service for [[Costi]]. He's worried that he'd be hunted more as a deserter compared to a draft dodger. But if he's high-profile enough that might not matter, he'd have to hide his identity either way. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] takes a moment quietly to try and scry on [[Eva Sidorev]], but she resists. [[Costi]] asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to send to [[Costi's mom]] the exact wording of what [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] said, he does. She replies, "Ah, interesting. Thank you [[Hugh|Finn]]"

[[Freya]] takes a nap to call [[The Curator]], asking to make sure that the [[Alhoon]] is still in [[New Fairhaven]] and if there's anything happening in [[Jezeten]]. [[Freya]] gets a yes for the first, but 3 prods for the second that we're unsure what it means. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] makes his way through the camp to the [[Made Fors]] headquarters. It's a surprise (re)birthday party with over 100 warforged there. He (re)meets [[Caio]], but has no memory of them. They force him up on stage, and [[Ligo]] gives a toast to welcome him back to the world. Even if he doesn't join them, they're all glad for their friend back. 

He learns that [[Caio]] served in [[Luthei Region]] but transferred under [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] when he started to show some proclivity towards natural magics. [[Hugh|Finn]] says he may have forgotten him, and [[Ligo]] says everyone here understands it's a side effect of what's happened to them. 

He mentions his former relationship of [[Major Teld]], who's apparently been talking quite a bit about [[Hugh|Finn]]. [[Ligo]] says he dislikes warforged in general, but takes particular fault in [[Hugh|Finn]] escaping service - he believes it might be the reason of his lack of progressing through the ranks. He's been actively challenging [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] for control of the [[Eberronian Second Division]]. 

[[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] asks if [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] will go to the [[ELA]] mission. He says going around [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] may make him show his cards, which could be useful. It would be useful to take care of him, but we should be careful since he'll be surrounded by his most loyal men. 

The [[Made Fors]] will be going elsewhere based on additional information they were able to get from [[Nicky]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] asks what re-enlisting would mean, and he learns his hierarchy would be [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]], then [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], then the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. 

[[Marigold]] mentions her [[Bane]] fist was removed, but [[Sven]]'s was not. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] goes to talk to [[Caio]]. It's awkward, but [[Hugh|Finn]] calls him out on it and asks him to explain. He says about 90 years ago, back in the [[Luthei Region]], they were stationed together. They were "pretty good friends". [[Hugh|Finn]] asks if that's all, and [[Caio]] says they spent several years doing everything together, they were best friends. [[Hugh|Finn]] introduced [[Maurice]], and they immediately bond. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] invites the rest of us to join, and by the time we get there drinking and partying has started in the reception room. We try and make our way there subtly enough, and on our way [[Hugh|Finn]] plays wingman for [[Freya]] to [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]]. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] introduces us to [[Caio]], and [[Freya]] makes the connection speaking in possum, of course. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] gets offered [[Idep Powder]], and they cut our doses based on the drinking. [[Rez]] goes to hang out with [[Marigold]], who thinks it should be given to organics more often (never mind the last guy, he wasn't dead for long). It goes well enough for us, until [[Costi]] passes out mid-conversation. With a slap to the face, he comes back to consciousness immediately sober. 

[[Freya]] approaches [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]]. It's hilarious and awkward, and she says please don't ask her to count because she totally can but just doesn't want to. Then does a shot of lindith with [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]]. They talk about their sparing earlier. 

[[Rez]] is goofing around with [[Marigold]], [[Costi]] and [[Freya]] talk further with [[Caio]]. She leave [[Guu]] with him for the night, and channels [[Rez]] for the confidence. It works well enough. She goes to "see the rest of the camp", and they both end up raging, [[Freya]] has a good time.

[[Costi]] really feels like he should take some of the [[Idep Powder]], for study, obviously. He gets two doses. [[Rez]] and [[Marigold]] chit-chat until the party winds down.

[[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]] have a chat before bedtime, he opens up about how disorienting it is to feel everything from his various lives. He asks how [[Costi]] deals with time. Unsure how to answer fully, he says many people have confusion with time, and he seems like he has lived two lives. [[Hugh|Finn]] says many people he knew were dead, and [[Costi]] says at least he has time. [[Hugh|Finn]] isn't sure how to move on, when it feels like he was with [[Eva Sidorev|Eva]] yesterday. [[Costi]] offers for us to go visit her. [[Rez]] joins in to say [[Hugh|Finn]] should be sure he's got friends who will live forever if he's going to live forever, and that's probably why the [[Made Fors]] are so close. We all talk about how [[Hugh|Finn]] can adjust to this new understanding of his life.

In the morning we discuss if we should go with the [[Eberronian Seventh Brigade]], and whether or not both [[Hugh|Finn]] or [[Costi]] will join the [[Eberronian Military]]. [[Costi]] brings up that he has none of the required skills to be a spy, like lying, or holding his tongue, or sneaking... He'd much rather be a face for resistance around the continent. He feels like any other option would compromise his values. We decide to decide later - once we go on this mission with [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]].

We give the [[ELA]] a heads up, "[[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] is leaving in 3 days for camps SW of [[Burbank Compound]]. We are tasked with helping, what should we do?", she replies, "Send to me again in 7 hours. I hate this." He does, she shares, "Exact numbers of troops, other notable names, time of departure, note 12 hours before leaving compound, regular updates once gone - every 6 hours. more" "keep a low profile and do your best to communicate your specific position, someone will find you. Keep him safe"

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] speaks a little about what role we're willing or unwilling to play, and how our relationship with the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] might change with that. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] goes to speak with the [[Made Fors]]. [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] agrees to answer questions for him. [[Hugh|Finn]] says he wants to avoid [[Costi]] joining the [[Eberronian Military]], but he thinks it would benefit [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] for someone to be involved, but [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] reads through the lines as "in name only". He warns that with all of his background, the best they could do would be a Private, with minimal but occasional tasks. [[Hugh|Finn]] asks about espionage, and [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] says he could get him in touch but questions if it's his skillset. [[Hugh|Finn]] says we do it often, even if it's not HIM doing it. [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] also warns that he may not stay in charge forever, and if the [[Made Fors]] dissolved he'd still be enlisted. Warforged terms of service are also longer than those for organics. For most divisions, it's life, but the [[Eberronian Second Division]] has been able to limit that - at shortest 15 years. 

[[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] says he wants [[Hugh|Finn]] in the [[Made Fors]] - he thinks he can be an inspiration to other warforged. He's gone through more than most, and his kindness would be an asset. He gets a little too candid about deserting, and gets a warning from [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] to not say anything like that again. He then heads out to do some training. 

He fights [[Hall]], showing a new battle form and significantly more martial abilities. He wins rather handedly, and ends the sparring round by healing [[Hall]]. He tells [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] he'll think about it and have answers in a few days. 

Over the next two days:

[[Costi]] tries to read about necromancy again, but can't seem to power through. He complains to the group, and [[Hugh|Finn]] offers to enhance his ability tomorrow. With some inspiration from [[Rez]] too, he finally gets through the book and has a basic understanding of undead. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] tries to scry on [[Eva Sidorev|Eva]] again, he sees an elderly halfling woman with gray hair and wrinkles, scar across the eye that is familiar. She's drinking port and playing cards with a group of other elderly women. She's terrible at cards, but clearly long-term friends with the group. He spends some time processing the emotions. 

[[Freya]] keeps hooking up with [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]], and gets more actively participatory. 

On our last day, [[Hugh|Finn]] tries to sneakily go join the [[Made Fors]], but the group convinces him he has time to make that decision. He says he trusts [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]], but also feels like this is something he needs to do - he refuses to let [[Costi]] and thinks it will be necessary for our group. 

We get a note from [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] that [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] will need to leave for [[Don't Tell Teld]] in the next 24 hours, asks if we'll join, and that he'll try to see us before we leave. We let him know we will be joining, we get a schedule - we'll leave at 8 in the morning, and arrive at 7. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] swings by our room to say goodbye. We ask for more specifics. Says it's 3 days SW of here, and we won't travel by the roads. We'll travel through the trees, and believe the camps are more secluded. We should report to [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] and he recommends we only make waves when we need to. He recommends we be persuasive, careful, and follow his orders to the letter. 832 troops are going, spread over a few miles. We'll probably be stationed with a few military members, maybe [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] himself. He says [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] has always followed his tasks exactly, and has very loyal men beneath him. He also encourages us to report back afterward to be sure we give our full report, with the subtext it could be safer for us to have our reasoning and path laid out. He also gives us some healing potions before we leave. 

As we're about to go to bed for the last time in the [[Burbank Compound]], [[Hugh]] sendings to [[Eva Sidorev|Eva]] again, saying, "Who is 'we'? I miss you". She replies, "My husband, [[Heyner]], and our four kids. Maybe some of the grandkids will be around as well - they've heard a lot about you". [[Hugh|Finn]] copes by going to the [[Made Fors]] camp and finding the first person who's down to help take his mind off of it. It's bad, and makes it worse. He ends his night going to find [[Marigold]] and crying it out. She hold him through it.
