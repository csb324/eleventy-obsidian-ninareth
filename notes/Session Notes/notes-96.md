# Detailed Notes: Session 96

We wake up with two days until we head to [[Viliki]] for our investigations. Our group talks about [[Rez]], [[Costi]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s choice to tell the [[Burbanks]]. [[Freya]] tells us that she made another deal with [[The Curator]], for an unknown favor. We reiterate some of our same concerns about their influence, and [[Freya]] shares that she didn't know if she had a choice, might have to be less honest about it in the future, but will try to untangle herself. We all hope for the best. 

[[Hugh]] and [[Guu]] go to the gardens, escorted by [[Private Hageth]]. After about 15 minutes, [[Hugh]] is stopped by a warforged wearing a number of axes, with "MF" engraved on his chest, named [[Captain Ligo Krikeav]]. It's clear that he's important, and puts the Private to work. [[Ligo]] introduces himself and says he's heard a lot about him, saying he's prodigious for a two year old. He says he's excited to see [[Hugh]] in action, which isn't happening *yet*. He directs a unit, the [[Made Fors]], a group of 184 warforged, run by warforged, who prefer action over peace. They kick folks out every few months who aren't up to standards, it's one of the most prestigious units in the [[Eberronian Military]]. He invites him to a party, and hints that [[Hugh]] might want to join their ranks sooner or later. [[Hugh]] ends the conversation by asking if [[Ligo]] wants something from him, and [[Ligo]] says no - but he's been a legend around here, and he wanted to meet him after all of the stories. As he leaves, he makes [[Hugh]] promise to come see him after his procedure. 

[[Freya]] hides in the room. As soon as she's alone, she hears [[Cliff Burbank]] knock on the door, and opens with her request to tour the dungeons. They discuss her [[Wayfinders]] progress, and he laments that she can't get a step in [[Eberron]]. He knows [[Rawley]], from when he's a younger man, they were at the same party. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] escorts her through the private wing, and on the way talks about how important it is that his 'eccentricities' are unseen to give him the autonomy he needs. He shows all the protections they have to keep people out... or in. The top level is for minor infractions, where they can have a whipping or stay for two weeks. The level below is darker, where they keep dangerous criminals. He gets [[Freya]] into one of the cells, closes the door behind him, and only then -- brings up what we told [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]]. She admits to it, but says she'd never wish any of the [[Burbanks]] harm. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says, as long as nothing happens to any one in his family, or his division, he can count this as her first and second strike. If something does happen though, well, he has no responsibility to [[Freya]], or [[Rez]], and for that matter [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] might be reunited with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] sooner rather than later. [[Freya]] makes a plea to be the only one who suffers from her choices, he denies the request. He says he hopes nothing else goes wrong, and if it were to in the future, that maybe [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] should keep it quiet. As they part, he gives her a golden bottle of brandy. 

[[Freya]] and [[Hugh]] have a mutually confusing recap to where she had been. He's able to see through her facade, she's clearly rattled. But she asks him to stop asking, and tries to work out her worry, with working out. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] plays the harp.

[[Costi]] and [[Rez]] go to the library. [[Rez]] is just there to see what finds her, and finds [[Scales of Stone]], by [[Olvadra Sunderhorn]]. She's intensely focused and atypically serious. [[Costi]] starts by looking for information on warforged but finding nothing, starts to search for information on dunamancy and chronomancy. It seems clear that [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] loves memoirs and autobiographies. [[Costi]] finds [[The Gem of TIme]] by [[Opal (silver hand)]]. We're able to take them back to our room, and some are allowed to leave the chateau by request. We log our requests and give them some gold as collateral. 

We all recap, and we learn a bit about [[Freya]]'s threats from [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], [[Ligo]] wanting something from [[Hugh]], and the books we found.

[[Costi]] learns [[Opal (silver hand)]] was an extremely adept manipulator who was responsible for much of what the [[The Silver Hand]] did, and lead from the [[Right Hand]]. She also had ties to a number of other secret societies, that we know very little about. Many scholars are critical of the [[Intrepid Zumbini]] for killing her, as a lead to these secret societies. She is seen as one of the most impactful people from the [[The Second Sundering]]. Skimming it, he runs into the name [[Morthos]], and learns that she was one of the first practitioners of dunamancy. It was written about 100 years ago, around 250 years after her death. 

Throughout the rest of the day, [[Rez]] and [[Costi]] read, [[Freya]] works herself out into unconsciousness, [[Hugh]] knits.

[[Trisha]] comes that evening to talk through the dossier she prepared, and invites us to her private dining room. She passes around papers, backed with a thin sheet of lead, that she explains is our dossier. 

It gives some history of [[Viliki]], a newer settlement, about 46 years old, of about 10,000 people. It's about a weeks travel outside [[Jezeten]]. It's under [[Baron Pendaras Nushkev]]'s protection, who known as an absentee baron and rules very lightly. The [[Burbanks]] have filled the void, and are essentially in charge. The [[Eberronian Second Division]] tends to be the dominate force wherever it goes. It outlines the order of [[Eberron]] nobility: the three duke are co-leaders, all heavily rumored to be undead, though [[Duke v'Luthei]] is the most senior, in a well known unofficial secrets. From there, power goes from earls, to barons, then patricians - they make up nobility. Mayors and the like exist in minor power elsewhere. 

[[Mayor Galfeedz Drakurshire]] a half-orc retired Admiral who runs [[Viliki]] and reports directly to the [[Burbanks]]. He issued the main reports that are leading us on this necormantic goose chase. [[Baron Pendaras Nushkev]] lives in [[Viliki]], but appoints power out to the mayor. [[Captain Kalorek Plunderov]] who is in the [[Eberronian Second Division]] and oversees the military garrison there, and [[Security Director Aldi]] who is a civilian and leads the [[Viliki]] guard.

[[Hugh]] asks about [[Ligo]], [[Trisha]] says he's been requesting an audience for some time that they told him to wait on. He's well-respected and a formidable military fighter and commander, a new model called [[Quicksilver]]. He directs a great deal of the military side of their warforged operation, he was brought in soon after [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] took command of the [[Eberronian Second Division]]. [[Hugh]] thinks he may have an issue with biologics, and [[Trisha]] says it's not an uncommon feeling amongst warforged, especially those in the [[Eberronian Military]]. They're one of the most brutal and well-known forces, known for not leaving much behind. They aren't typically utilized domestically. [[Hugh]] asked why she'd be interested in him, and she believes he'd be trying to recruit [[Hugh]]. It might be for combat, but they also need healers because they pride themselves on not losing many. 

[[Costi]] is visited by [[Samuel]] in his sleep, [[Samuel]] makes it clear that [[Costi]] does not talk to [[The Raven Queen]], but goes through him. He says [[The Curator]] is not known on who or WHAT they are. [[The Raven Queen]] didn't even know of them, and is looking into it. [[Costi]] shares that they offered an option when he swore his allegiance to [[The Raven Queen]], but he wasn't tempted because he hates them. [[Samuel]] says if he's ever slow to respond it's because this has caught his interest. He thanks [[Costi]] for bringing it up to them, and sends him off to sleep. 

We sending to [[Ravona Silentreed]] to dictate [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s letter to [[Darek Spout]]. She says she'll deliver it as soon as she can. 

	Darek,
	
	sorry to reach out this way. Tried to respect your space. Hugh only told me yesterday he saw you.
	
	Yes, I died. Zmaj's crew knows of my resurrection and will explain in appropriate detail (7: Use best judgement. Thanks.)
	
	Important: A man I used to work for, Julian slater-runehorn, owns dad's debt. Do not trust under any circumstances. He's dangerous. He did this to control me. I'm furious. I'm sorry. I will fix it.
	
	Until then, be careful.
	
	If sending money helps, I will. Only if it helps.
	
	Please tell family not to trust slater-runehorn. If you tell them I'm alive, include this: I care about you all. I wish things were different.
	
	If you need anything else, 7 can get in touch with me. Alternatively, Wyn Elreal at boundless grove.
	
	I'll message soon so you can reply.
	
	Adrienne

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sendings to [[Darek Spout]] once she knows it's delivered, but doesn't get a response.
