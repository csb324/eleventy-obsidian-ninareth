# Detailed Notes: Notes 152

[[Freya]] comes home, and we talk a loooooot about how to, or if we should, kill OR frame OR otherwise impede the goals of [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]]. And how it works with both [[A Murder of Dukes]] and [[ELA Day of Action]].

[[Freya]] (over)buys a bow and some arrows.

We arrange a meeting with [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] and [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]. Telling them we've talked with [[ELA]] leadership - they want to know everything. [[A Murder of Dukes]] gets moved up. We discuss the [[Slavaadi College]] role in [[ELA]] leadership. They're not worried, even if [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] is a plant, he's been helpful to their cause and the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] have contingencies. 

He will manage while enabling the chaos on [[ELA Day of Action]], after the party he, and many of his soldiers, will be drunk. Who can blame him for that? 

He plans to frame [[Gorbulzhava]], we try to clarify our involvement and our cover story. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] doesn't want to tell us, because we won't like it, and requires some degree of moral flexibility we might hate. 

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] will be following behind us. We leave one guard alive, she'll alter his memories, to remember us bursting into the room almost in time to save her from some escaping members of the [[ELA]], who will be felled a few days later by the [[Eberronian Second Division]]. They haven't determined who, and asked us to share anyone in particular we need not there. Likely 4-5 members, as well as some leadership. 

They share they could be [[Eberron]] citizens or outside agitators. We suggest, perhaps, [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]]. There's a lot of good here, but there's also a risk of an international incident with [[Zalev]]. Maybe killing him, instead of extraditing him, could ease tensions? Or could he go to [[Orzudan]]? 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says that there can be no more than one surviving witness, and it should be a weak guard. Ideally unconscious. 

[[Trisha]] joins to tell us that [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] captured [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] and will have him brought back here within a few days. He'll have to be tried for his new crimes, including a few thousand counts of necromancy. [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] will probably get a medal!

We ask about the [[Game Warden]], they'll try to look into who she might be (there's two options) and go ask the proprietor of the establishment where they got drinks - once we tell them when we scryed. They say the other guy could likely be [[Kharmar Hammersong]]. The [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] will try to move them both so they're not players during the [[ELA Day of Action]], or potentially get them drunk too. They warn there's a good chance [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] could be there too.

They ask us to push the [[ELA]] to 10 days out. We send to the ELA: "We have the opportunity for a high profile target. We need 10 days. It's worth it." [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] says that will work. 4th of Fentanti. Learned about [[Kharmar Hammersong]]. Finn sold a bunch of stuff for 92g

Our party spends a few days of down time.

We got summoned to talk to [[Jehneim Bastienev]], who told us we were needed in the tunnels under the [[Stormwall district]] to address the [[ELA]]. We received a map of the tunnels, and to "stop the things that got out and the people who did it", which should include no more than a dozen vampire spawn. The [[ELA]] made it to a certain area, which triggered an alarm, and they haven't left yet. Either they're on purpose or they're dead. 

They send us by carriage, the area is rough - barred windows, though why is a question.
