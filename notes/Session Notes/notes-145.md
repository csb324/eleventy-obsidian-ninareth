# Detailed Notes: Session 145

As we walk along the tunnel leading to the lowest level of the [[Zhakastin Expedition]], [[Rez]] pulls a card, the 8 of hearts, from the [[Deck of Illusions]] to hopefully delay anyone coming after us. It's a bugbear! We tell it to hide, mediumly well, so that it's threatening and a delay but neither hidden nor out in the open.

We sneak our way down, the coal dust dissipates, and we feel comfortable using fire again. We enter into a cross-road of tunnels, though a large cave-in blocks the direct path into the mining chamber. [[Shraule]], after much begging, looks to see that the cave-in was about 25-30 ft thick. Importantly, within the room, the three headed wizard shot magic at the her, and there are a a couple dozen skeletons in the room, and a big elevated pillar is in the center of the room. Some of the sapphire is mined, and water covers the floor. 

We decide to go to the overseer's office, along the isolated left-most path. As we begin the path, [[Freya]] picks up a strong stagnant water scent, brackish. We talk briefly about the oddity of that, but it smells like undeath and still, gross water. 

As we approach the larger main hallway leading up overseer's office, is a door into the mining chamber that was not there before. [[Rez]] puts a minor illusion over the door to try and reduce any potential sightline of us. We discuss some other options, but ultimately decide to have [[Rez]] make a backdrop of what the hallway looks like to cover us from line of sight while we walk through to the door.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] creeps through, following a line of chalk [[Rez]] trails -- [[Freya]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and [[Rez]] make it to the end of the hallway. [[Costi]] trips, which we all see, but nothing immediately happens. [[Hugh|Finn]] perfectly sneaks down. 

We reach the overseers office's, there's bookshelves built along the walls and a solo stone desk. There's no blood splatter here, which is notable. [[Hugh|Finn]] notices that the room has been totally stripped, no signs of blood, even cleaned.

[[Rez]] and [[Costi]] team up with minor illusions to let him sneak (hop) to the desk to investigate it. Using his ghostly gaze, he sees a series of buttons and a hidden drawer, inside is another broken piece of a ruby, that looks very similar to the first part we found. 

We mess with it for a minute, the force themselves to reconnect when they are about an inch apart. They are still inert, but there is no sign that they were ever rendered. 

[[Costi]] casts a polymorph into his bead of power. We all try our best to sneak back towards the mining chamber, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] saving [[Hugh|Finn]] from accidentally outing all of us. 

We realize we're being funneled to the main entrance. There’s [[Jalene]], now undead, [[Un-baby]], a large Draconic, and while most are draconic creatures some are not. There’s a platform 40ft up, on top of the spoiled water, with two pillars on them reaching up to the ceiling. 

On one of the pillars there’s a flayed draconic with another spike through it. 

[[Freya]] throws the soul of [[Jalene]] at her, [[Costi]] has the ruby, and as she reverts to her normal we assume appearance a more flows back into the stone and [[Costi]] feels a warmth. He’s pretty sure it contains her soul, he feels like he could issue commands to control her (BA). She's free! Unless [[Costi]] decides differently. 

[[Rez]] pulls the spike out of a central pillar, freeing [[Un-baby]], who's name in [[Shen]]. Armed with two new allies: [[Jalene]] and [[Shen]], we finally take down the [[Zormvrik]].

[[Zormvrik]] says he wanted to keeping pets, reclaim our home, [[Un-baby]] is named [[Shen]]. He asks [[Costi|Cost-ape]] to pee on the [[Zormvrik]] 's dead body, [[Costi]] immediately regrets that choice when he has to search him. [[Shen]] says he's been undead for a while. He's pretty mentally broken, was killed by the three head dozens of times. 

[[Costi]] returns the ruby soul to [[Jalene]], freely given -- it returns to her ring. She says the draconics on site did not enslave her either. 

[[Zormvrik]] showed up here two months ago, he primarily talked in this antiquated form of goblin. He's originally from [[The Shadowfell]], as refugees, trying to rebuild their numbers to take back their home city [[The City of Endless Night]] also known as [[The City of Endless Night|Naitho Uvea]] -- it's roughly correlated to [[Quaath]] in [[The Shadowfell]]. [[The Raven Queen]] would be very against [[The City of Endless Night]], as she's constantly hunted within [[The Shadowfell]]. [[Zormvrik]] wanted revenge against their king, something like [[The Nightmare King]]. 
(*Sorry wait, something like who?? - Clara*)

We ask if he said any names like Morty - he said maybe, but not in a friendly way. 

There's another place a few miles away where he went with [[Zormvrik]], there wasn't another shipment of undead due for another few days. [[Shen]] can take us there. We plan to learn more, and go, after we search [[Zormvrik]].
