# Detailed Notes: Session 71

Retroactively, we think about the olives, but there doesn't seem to be any magical essence. They still read as weird to us, but we move on.

The room is different than we expect, there are still benches on the side but the room is cast in a gloomy green light, hazing the edges. There are only 4 crypts, BUT MORE OVER, 4 saint adrews cross each with a corpse nailed to them. [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]! Inbetween them, there's a figure with fine rooms muttering softly. A skeletal creature with red eyes and flesh clinging to it's body turns to look at us, smile turning into a sneer as it attacks. [[Jade]] quickly cancels his first attack, and [[Costi]] burns some of his resistances. One of the ghost creatures he awakens has a counterspell stone that we remembered from the [[Bloody Waters]] fight we did, it was pretty unique. Doubt it's a coincidence?? [[Samuel]] seems to cause more damage when he's hurt near him? [[Our Fiend Samuel]]. At one point [[Costi]] casts through [[Samuel]] and the damage turns into a swirling storm of feathers, killing the skeletal figure leading the fight. 

Two of the bodies on the crosses look almost identical in size and shape, but it's impossible to tell more as they are fully flayed, their eyes gouged, and all identifying features have been removed. 

[[Rez]] and [[Jade]] go look at the magic the skeleton was casting, [[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] go to investigate his body, and [[Freya]] scouts for any more sound. On his body, we find a scroll with somewhat familiar writing - it's got arcane sigils that [[Costi]] recognizes as dunamantic. On the ground, near one of the ghosts, is a magical stone. In the back of his cape, against his neck, [[BD]]. We also find [[The Raven Queen]] feathers on his body. The magic in the corner doesn't give off arcane remnants, but the corpses on the cross nearby are strangely identical, as though they've been carved to be similar. All of the crosses were pointing to the same direction. The body hung furthest in the room is missing his left hand.  The one near the skeleton's magic has a [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]], after 'checking' [[Jade]] goes to grab it and discovers it's connected somehow, but pulls with a mucus-covered tendon where it seemed to be attached internally. [[Jade]]'s glasses flash ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]?) and she notices on the back of the ruby, is a symbol [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]]. 

We discuss what the symbol might mean, but no one recognizes it. [[Rez]] and [[Freya]] tries to see inside what the ruby was attached too. It's skull has been hollowed out, so whatever it was attached to is missing now. 

[[Hugh]] tries to respectfully pull down the bodies on the crosses, while the rest of us try to ascertain what direction the crosses are facing - [[Freya]] believes it's North-ish. The crypt that the creatures was standing on read "[[Baldred Duvey|B. Duvey]] 3369", "[[R. Duvey]] 3284", and "[[Z. Duvey]] 3336". The one on the far side doesn't have a plate. It looks like the one that the skeleton was on was recently moved, it's slight askew. [[Hugh]] wants to move him back into the crypt, but [[Samuel]] poops on him to show his displeasure. We decide to set him aflame instead. [[Hugh]], prays and [[Costi]] spits. 

[[Rez]] and [[Jade]] tumble while 'trying' to open the crypt, and they 'slip'  breaking the [[The Gaze Grafter]]. It knits itself together. yaaaay. [[Rez]] reattaches it to her belt, very loosely. We decide we've done our best, and head back into the time warp room. 

Entering now, it's eerily similar to the first version we saw. This time, we thankfully remember our previous trip. We now notice a new door though, which leads to the elevator. We do some due diligence and decide that it's relatively the same. 

We step back into the hallway to take a quick breather. [[Costi]] learns that the stone we found is an [[Ioun Stone]], holding three slots. We talk about [[Hugh]] putting a revivify in it for safety. We backtrack to try and cover our tracks. On our way we notice a shallow hold where something buried bodies. We creep down the second hallway, which appears to be a deadend. About halfway through, we recognize the smell of undead, but it seems to not be present anymore. At the very edge of the end, there's a small remnant of shapes, like the top line of sigils that had been erased. [[Costi]] recognizes parts of the shape as traditional to only conjuration or abjuration. 

[[Rez]] and [[Costi]] talk about optimal tool design and she makes something she thinks would work. [[Hugh]] and [[Freya]] go up to the [[Sheske Eeping]] floor to try and make the hole look the same as the top one we followed down. 

[[Jade]] invites [[Rez]] to a back room to try and blow off some steam, as a guise to destroy the [[The Gaze Grafter]]. She's disappointed at first, but after some consideration they realize [[Rez]] could try to create lava to melt down the mirror. And boy does she, gallons of it. Lava everywhere, but it seems to fully coat and destroy the mirror. 

We all come back together and make our way to back to the elevator. Our friends put on their disguises again, and we're greeted by [[Ravona Drakness]] and [[Gaarth]]. We return their feathers, and they check them, recognizing that their devotees have passed. We run down what happened, using our cover story, but do decide to discuss the [[Vecna]] but not the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles |Mysterious Circles]]. She's very concerned, and will send down experts to investigate. We also show her the broken orb pieces from the first level. She takes them to investigate. We share that we couldn't find any sort of goal there, and takes that into account. 

To thank us, she leads us back to the main chapel and instructs us to kneel. [[Samuel]] flies over, and gives us a few of his feathers. We're each handed one, and told to make a vow:

"I vow to keep the moment of passage sacred, And to hold those who seek to erode it to account. I vow to help those souls seeking solace as I can, To destroy those who violate the divinity of life, and to honor the raven. From this day â€˜till my last, I watch for death. And keep this world for those who keep their breath" 

As we do, our real names flit over the feather before fanding, leaving our hands tingling. She invites us to stay as long as we like, they will start investigating immediately. She's got deep concerns, and asks that we check back in a few weeks. We say our goodbyes, and as we leave [[Costi]] goes and does a real prayer to [[The Raven Queen]], thanking her for [[Samuel]] and asking for help on more undead, but seems unnatural. As we leave, we bump into an older halfling who seems vaguely familiar to [[Rez]], but we can't place him.

We go back to the [[Chapel of the Lost]]
