# Detailed Notes: Session 93

We all arrive back at the [[Home Tree of Ru'Nileth]] at the same time, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] shares we should expect to talk to [[Wyn Elreal]] later. We argue a bit about the god's intent - and whether we can trust them blindly. We all update on our various escapades. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] vaguely remembers [[Willow|Davi]], but certainly remembers [[Dalyor Torlana]]. She shares that it's been years since she spoke with [[Adrienne's Family]]. She sent them a note 5-6 years ago, but they didn't want to hear from her. It seems that took her scholarship to [[Jalantar]] and work with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] as abandonment, at least from the perspective of one of her brothers. It's a tough situation.

After some paperwork clearances, a 30's wood elf, with shoulder length dark hair with flecks of gray and lighter skin - it's [[Wyn Elreal]]. He seems like he had serious strength, but hasn't utilized it in a few years, with small scars across his face. We start by catching him up on much of the background of [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] and [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]], then he offers to share his story.

He was part of a group out of [[The Boundless Grove|Boundless Grove]], traveling around helping [[Dilandil]] ex-pats. He largely traveled with two married friends [[Clausen Roseleaf]] and [[David Roseleaf]]. They did that for a few years, they got into a job in [[New Fairhaven]], the capitol of the [[Bihor Region]]. Due to the risk, they had a few others come, his wife [[Aurora Pasashi]], and cousin [[Gauthoure Elreal]]. There was about 20 elves, overall, who'd established a sort of underground [[Church of Corellon Larethian]] and were worried they'd been discovered. By the time they got there, only one remained [[Jalhen Avendior]]. They had been attacked by a group of wordless [[Eberron]] guards, led by a young man with pale dark hair who seemed to be in his 20's. They later discovered he goes by the name [[Von]], who seems to be a bastard of [[Duke v'Bihor]]. The adults of the Grove were all killed, and the children were taken. They tracked him to an underground chamber, it seemed like a temple to someone. [[Von]] seemed to answer to a halfling who also had gold fingers, with many undead. Only [[Von]] and [[Wyn Elreal]] made it out. 

In the middle of the room, there was a pillar or short column, about 3 feet high, but on the top there was symbols like what we found on the bark when we [[Heal the Anchor Tree]]. He says unlike ours, blood was coating the whole area and streaming from the eye in the center of the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]]. He shared this update with the elders at the [[The Boundless Grove|Boundless Grove]], but isn't sure of follow-up outside of looking for [[Von]]. He hasn't had much overlap with the [[Wayfinders]], outside of getting to [[Eberron]] - but he was extracted on his way back, so it's unclear if they'd have anyway of knowing what occurred. 

[[Rez]] asks if he'd count himself as our friend in this effort moving forward, and he seems willing, especially if we're able to go after [[Von]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] also asks him to keep an eye out for messages from the [[Bramble Grove]].

Before bed [[Hugh]] sends to [[Magister]], [[Rez]] saw [[Zmaj]], saying we're in [[Locations/Cities and Towns/Ru'Nileth|Ru'Nileth]]. We'll be in [[Quaath]] tomorrow, and to dream [[Costi]] if needed. He says he's looking forward to seeing us. He also sends to [[Costi's mom]], "Wife, we are in runeleth. Alive. Saved anchor tree. Killed lot of undead. Costi tied to raven queen? Heading to [[Eberron]] tomorrow. Any advice?". She responds, "That's wonderful [[Hugh]]. Hopefully I'll see you while you're here. Be careful and don't make a spectacle of yourselves. Love you both" [[Costi]] sends to [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]].

[[Zmaj]] arrives to escort us out. [[Rez]] asks if she should go to the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]] in [[Quaath]], and he says he's already been in contact with some elders there. [[Hugh]] gives him earmuffs he made. He also looked up [[Adrienne's Family]], and asks if she'd like help for them. He says [[Darek Spout]] joined the military and is in line for a promotion, they could probably grease the wheels and speed that up. He also referenced some concern from [[Branton Spout]]'s behavior but had no details. He offered to get some notes cleared and redacted then sent to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] once approved. 

As we head through the tree, [[Rez]] gets a tingle on her copper bracelet at the same time as [[Zmaj]]. They share a smile. 

We arrive in [[Quaath]], surrounded by [[Bahamat]] guards. They recognize us and welcome us back by asking for our papers. After letting us fret for a minute, they say the [[Gia'Thoren]] have sponsored us for a week. He's affable enough, and he gives us some recommendations for food at the [[Marble Dome]] and says if we're looking for fun to go to the [[Silver Circle]]. When hears us mention [[The Silver Halves]] he recognizes [[Rez]] and related to [[Vask]], saying he tried to get to [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]] he was turned away. 

[[Magister]] says they'll meet us wherever we are in about 3 hours. We decide to hear to the [[Marble Dome]], they have single rooms available and we wait for our lunch reservation there. It's exorbitantly nice, we all relax in our own way for a bit. We have an extravagant tasting menu lunch, that [[The Silver Halves]] add themselves to with a small bribery.  

We surprise them with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and they catch us up on their coming and goings. She says that about 10 days ago a bomb exploded in [[Eberron]], [[Luthei Region]], believed to be courtesy of [[ELA]]. That [[Arkhosia]]'s rebellion is creating unrest in other nations too. They aren't familiar with [[Von]] by name, they offered to ask questions. 

[[Rez]] seems to have something come over her part way through the lunch, and leaves midway through. [[Hugh]], and then everyone else notices but isn't sure what's up. She heads to her room.

At the table, [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] asks if we're traveling to [[Eberron]] with them, or courtesy of [[Cliff Burbank]]. The party discusses but decides to go the legal way, which is without [[The Silver Halves]]. They'll be in [[New Fairhaven]] and will look into [[Von]]. [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] says we just missed the ball she hosts every time she's back home. She says they'll be in town for the next few days, so we can let them know if we need anything. She offers for us to get drinks before we all separate. 

As they leave [[Magister]] has something for [[Costi]], a pocketwatch. He says it belonged to a friend of his, [[Chantille Garamont]] a talented chronomancer, she left it to him when she died. It's engraved "CG", which works for them both. She felt like all such wizards, needed a way to keep track of the time. It has some instructions to a few new spell options [[Costi]] can work on. When he carries it, he gets two extra spell slots that must be chronomantic in major, and when attuned, he gets a spell back equal to his proficiency bonus whenever he uses arcane recover. [[Costi]], "I sometimes get tripped up on the future", [[Magister]], "Well at least you're not hung up on the past". 

The party goes up to check on [[Rez]] and find her room is trashed. She shares that [[Zmaj]] just told her that her sister had died, he doesn't know much but he's going to [[Durmask]]. She's livid, and says this is exactly why she's concerned about [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]]. She's not sure it's involved, but assumes it has to be.  "[[Vask]] Tanin, get your dumbass immediately to the [[Marble Dome]]. Your sister needs you. Not fucking around", he responds: "I'm on the way, do not be in the room when I arrive."

She leaves a note for [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]: With [[Vask]], don't worry. Going to the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]], will be back later. Save me two bottles. 

[[Rez]] and [[Vask]] talk briefly and try to share the limited information they have. [[Vask]] says he got more information from [[Zmaj]], he's already in [[Durmask]]. She had a job in the [[Irvenhold]], and she had some friends there. He's trying to find her, to see if she's still there. He believes she's in pieces.

They head to the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]], where they're able to convince guards to let them have an audience - through some intentional words, and a loaded gun. There, they meet [[Krarrhec]], an elderly copper dragon born, and report on [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]] and get condolences on their sister - [[Zmaj]] had also reached out. [[Rez]] writes down a full summary ([[Rez's Report]]) and they're offered the chance to stay the night for protection in the Sanctuary. They refuse, but are very insistent that the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]] gets involved asap, and get promises that it will be taken care of. 

[[Rez]] arrives back before [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], tore up the note she had written, and when they ask if [[Vask]] came - she says yes, but worries what he'll get up to in the [[Copper Circle]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] finds blood from [[Vask]], and we talk about his tendency for violence. [[Rez]] undersells it a bit, but seems to be worried. [[Hugh]] makes [[Rez]] a small heart pillow embroidered with "sorry". 

Drunkenly, we discuss where we'll go. [[Rez]] agrees that [[Eberron]] is the move, they can't help her sister now. She warns she might need to leave at some point, and it seems like she won't be leaving alone. [[Hugh]] sends to [[Sienna Burbank]] ask for a ride: "Finally free of conflicts. Ready for discussion. In [[Quaath]]. How long till airship arrives? Is a stop in [[Deal 'Ras]] possible? Anything we should know?" She responds "We're taking off in about an hour, be there in 3 days. We can discuss the itinerary when we arrive. We'll notify you 12 hours out"

Over the next 3 days we try to sell some of our accumulated stuff. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] remembers that they were a significant mercantile family, they certainly interacted with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. Specifically worked with [[Carlot Duvey]].
