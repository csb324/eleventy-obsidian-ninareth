# Detailed Notes: Session 135

Dozens or hundreds of undead corpses form together to create a zombie clot. [[Burston Courtev]] is not what he appears, and is quite a strong necromancer. The clot feels much more rudimentary and bestial than the [[flesh stitched behemoth]]. 

We search [[Burston Courtev]], find a magical ring, the [[Ring of the Undead Masses]] (which [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] finds gives a particular desecrated vibe), noting a key that he has swallowed while still alive. He also finds a house key, gold, and a spell book. We don't find anything else of interest in the room, other than some idols to [[Pelor]] that [[Hugh|Finn]] pockets.

We send [[Samuel]] to investigate the hallway behind the secret door. There's a magical lever to pull it open, but we can't quite get it with the bird-fiend. We send him down to look for the [[Pelor]] worshippers, when [[Rez]] argues with the group to want to go save them. 

[[Samuel]] reports back that after a long unlit hallway, four guards are stationed at check point, traveling through two intersections, one with a staircase going downwards, before finding a larger fire lit chamber with about 15 guards in [[Eberronian First Division]] uniforms. 

We head back, cleaned up, and plan to kill time to recharge so we can break into his house. On the way there, we talk about who decides who needs to be stopped, or killed. Somehow, that turns into [[Costi]] altering himself to look like [[Burston Courtev]], except with flamboyant stripper heels to explain the height difference. Listen, it's a great plan.

As we near the house, [[Hugh|Finn]] spots someone surveilling the door. By the time we see them, it's too late to change the plan - [[Costi]] gives him a nod of acknowledgment. He then leans in to try and add to the story by very visibly pinching [[Rez]]'s ass, who loudly acknowledges it, then magehand pulling [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] into the house. 

[[Costi]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and [[Rez]] look around the apartment. Under the bed there's a loose floorboard, found with ghostly gaze, the key disarms several traps. We find letters hidden in code. Pocketing those, we return everything to normal. We don't find any necromancy licenses, but  [[Rez]] and [[Costi]] leave a forged note in [[Burston Courtev]]'s handwriting on the inside of the shop, on the door of his apartment.

Our mutual acquaintances have called me away, you should know for what. Keep eyes away from my proprietary work. I have some new ideas for when I'm back! PS - it was so good.

We back a bag of his stuff so it looks like he's left for real. And mess up the bed. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] looks around to scout out a spot for [[Costi]] to misty step out. She and [[Rez]] try to look the part as they leave. For such a little guy, such stamina!

We head back to our hotel. 

[[Costi]] talks to [[Rez]] about [[Rez's Family]], his theory is that maybe she and her siblings are the blood of the metallic dragons that [[Azir DarAxia|Saint Goldborn]] made a long time ago. [[Rez]] agrees it HAS to be true. 

Then we talk about drinks with [[Marius A]] and [[Elena]] that night, and how he wants to impress [[Elena]]. And how [[Marius A]] needs to be mortified. [[Rez]] has the perfect idea - she and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] will make him think they're interested, and then act like he's the stupidest man alive for not realizing they're actually into each other. 

[[Costi]] identifies the [[Ring of the Undead Masses]]. We agree to keep it for 83 days and the use the last week before the Clot revives to destroy it. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "[[Burston Courtev]] dead. Necromancer of surprising skill - fought early design like flesh stitched behemoth. Found hidden letters, but [[Costi]]'s breaking the code. First Division paying him!!", [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] "Excellent, good work. Update when code is broken, will find a reason to investigate the house."

[[Costi]] spends some time trying to break the code, with [[Rez]]'s help. They make pretty good progress on figuring out how it works, and think in another day or so they can figure it out. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] helped [[Freya]] get a new haircut after she lost some hair in the fight. She no longer has dreads or a top knot. 

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] spend some time at [[AVAD]]. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]], she talks to [[Wyn Elreal]]. He's heading south, unclear where. We discuss how lots of people seem to be heading to [[New Fairhaven]], 

[[Hugh|Finn]] communes with [[TrueSilver]]:
	"Is it safe to use the [[Ring of the Undead Masses]] for 83 days", he receives, "Safe? yes"
	"Should we destroy the [[Ring of the Undead Masses]]", he receives, "yes"
	"Is the undead activity in the [[Turian Waste]]s tied to what's threatening the gods?" "Yes"

We debate if [[Freya]] should wear it or not. We decide to do it while we're still in town so we have resources. We'll cut off her pinky finger if she needs to, and remove curse is an option too. 

[[Freya]] puts it on, but does NOT want to take it off, at least until [[Hugh|Finn]] casts a remove curse. That doesn't stop us from arguing about if it's safe, or smart, or evil to use. We begrudgingly agree to wait on our decision on what to destroy it. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] pulls [[Hugh|Finn]] in to council him on the fact that [[Freya]] is going to do what she wants to do, and being right is not enough and he has the same argument with [[Freya]] over and over. She'll help him make it impressive to maybe convince her in a way that is not just yelling at her - like he spends a lot of time doing. [[Hugh|Finn]] doesn't understand why she doesn't just listen to him.

Meanwhile, [[Freya]] decides what's easiest to defuse the party is just give the ring to [[Rez]] for now. [[Rez]] readily agrees. And for that measure, any time there's an item they don't want she'll happily take it. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] practices the harp, and talks through some thoughts to [[Corellon Larethian]]. She hopes he's not sending backup because she's in over her head, but she's thankful either way. 

After everyone goes to bed, [[Hugh|Finn]] sneaks outside. He finds a quiet spot where he can see the stars and does a private prayer moment to [[TrueSilver]] back where it all began.
