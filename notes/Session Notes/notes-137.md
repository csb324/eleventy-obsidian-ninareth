# Detailed Notes: Session 137

In the morning, [[Freya]] and [[Costi]] read [[Kith and Kin]]. They learn the last part of information we're seeking is the most hidden. Great. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Rez]], and [[Hugh|Finn]] go to brunch. It's funny and a little strange. 

We bring back eggs for [[Freya]], who makes it clear she did not want to fuck [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] and she was just trying to save the prank. We get into a weird group conversation on who doesn't want to fuck who, and who is not discussed at all. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] leaves. It's fine. 

Everyone rubs it in [[Rez]]'s face that she failed her prank. She started annoyed by it and gets more annoyed as that progresses. Last night didn't go how she wanted and stop talking about it, okay??

[[Hugh|Finn]] corners [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], tries to be delicate about 'life advice' but gets a little aggressive. She says if she's letting something go it's for a good reason, [[Hugh|Finn]] calls out that maybe not being the case. It doesn't go how either of them maybe expected. 

We're in a weird place as a group by the time we load up into our caravan to go say goodbye to [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]]. 

As we're about to hit the road, [[Trisha]] comes to see us off. She gives us dark brown wooden box, and tells us not to open until we're out of the walls of the twin cities. When [[Hugh|Finn]] tries to take and shake it, [[Trisha]] is quick to say we should handle it carefully. 

[[Costi]] goes to say goodbye to [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]], and asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to come with (and help him speak better, magically). At their tea, she shares that the [[Eberronian First Division]] broke into an [[ELA]] safe house. [[Costi]] shares that [[Marius A]] stopped their lynching. The [[ELA]] is going to try to get them out, as the jails are packed and processes are moving slowly. She asks that [[Hugh|Finn]] save magical energy to let her know they are safe. [[Costi]] tries to ask his mom not to be part of the active front lines -- she QUICKLY puts him in his place. He makes a plea for the sake of [[Nadia]], saying that [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] took the only option for 'dying for the cause' between his parents. She considers it, but tells him "I will, if you will. I won't sit out a fight you aren't willing to." She says this has been her life, but she begged him not to join this fight. She's proud of him, and mad at him. But if he's in it, she's in it. She assures him that his dad and her have a plan in place for [[Nadia]]'s care if she were to also fall. 

[[Rez]] pretends to be [[Sylvia]] checking in on [[Rughork]] to see if someone picked up the stone, saying "Rughork? Worried I haven't heard from you, missing -- er -- awaiting instructions. They don't suspect anything, and I can still be helpful! What should I do?", there's no response. 

As we're leaving, we hear commotion outside of the carriage and people shouting [[Costi]]'s name. He notices it's people that [[Hugh|Finn]] recognized as being sort of shady, and as they get everyone's attention, [[Everlynd]], [[Mara]], [[Rulyania Bvok]], and [[Zukrad]] unroll a large sheet from a balcony saying "Hail [[Costi|Constantine Grosu]], hero of [[Golstrava]]" painted in blood.

We debate what we can do and how seriously this might be taken in the current environment, and we worry treason isn't off the table. [[Hugh|Finn]] decides to send to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] to see if he can maybe ensure their punishment is not death. 

[[Costi]] decides to try and intervene to contextually reduce the impact of what they've done. We turn the carriage around, and they've arrested roughly the four of them as well as two student accomplices. He says the insult was targeted to him, and demands the ability to punish them himself. The highest ranking guard seems taken aback and says he can escort them to the barracks to discuss charges to pursue. 

[[Costi]] tells [[Hugh|Finn]] to stand down and then demands [[Zukrad]], turns into [[Costi|Cost-ape]], and (non-lethally) beats the shit out of him. He tells the rest of them that similar treatment awaits all of them, but says they've learned their lesson. 

The guard asks who planned this, and while they all try to claim ownership, [[Everlynd]] takes responsibility. They say someone has to be taken in, and [[Costi]] puts on a cold performance that works. 

As we're right on the edge of town, [[Colvia Ghul]] stops the carriage and gets in. She tells us that messenger won't be working any more, and says the display at [[AVAD]] was disgraceful, after he saved all of those lives. She asks for a clarification, and casts zone of truth. 

She'd been keeping tabs on [[Burston Courtev]], saying he had been involved in the unsavory business involved in [[Viliki]], she learned some of it with [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]. hasn't attended usual activites, found note he was going underground. She asks if we know if he's dead. She asks if we killed him. She's been observing him for some time. 

[[Rez]] asks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] what we should do, they agree for a fake personal giving-in from [[Rez]] - who says she's sometimes impulsive, if [[Colvia Ghul]] wasn't aware, and yes [[Burston Courtev]] is dead.

shes not military shes from 

it can stay buried, does it need to, it depends on what the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] asked us to do, she does believe that [[Cliff Burbank]] talks to us 

if we believe that anyone in the [[Eberronian First Division]] would not be happy about this conversation and the [[Groups and Organizations/Burbanks|Burbanks]] or their people killed [[Burston Courtev]] then we should perhaps tell [[Colvia Ghul]] the full truth. 

We ask if [[Colvia Ghul]] is offering to cover for us? She says yes. This conversation will decide if she will report it, or she will not - ensuring that the report says he left town. It all depends if we answer her questions. 

Reading her demeanor, she seems gleeful to have something over [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. 

Telling her more, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] confirms we know that [[Jezeten]] city guards are involved, she confirms she knew that already. [[Rez]] clarifies that unsanctioned necromancy is illegal so we didn't do anything illegal by stopping illegal activity. [[Colvia Ghul]] warns that other people with significant sway could be upset by our actions regardless, and it might be best for [[Jezeten]], the people we care about, and the problem with the [[Southern Cities Increase Tension]] broadly to not be increased by this getting out.  

We try to play off her behavior, but she leans in - confirming she is threatening us. She finally goes to her true intent:

In the interdimensional space that we carry ([[My Hole]]), there was an object and piece of bark and on it was a symbol a serious of multiple overlapping [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Mysterious Circles]], it struck her as interesting, she would like to know what we know of them, why they were in the bag, and anything else that can help her in her own personal study. In particular, she watches [[Freya]] as she asks. 

As she asks, more than anything, we see that her intent it's not malicious, it's not angry, but it's ravenous hunger to know something that for once is totally unknown to her, she craves it.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] indicated that it's serious and lot of information, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks for a stay of execution, [[Colvia Ghul]] offers to delay our decision until we return to [[Jezeten]] to decide if this is something we're willing to share. Our reception could be colored one way or another based on how we answer

"knowledge shared is power given"

As she teleports away, we remember we can teleport back into [[Sienna Burbank]]'s house, if we need to avoid a sticky entrance into [[Jezeten]] or further delay our answer.

We decide to open the box from the [[Groups and Organizations/Burbanks|Burbanks]], and only [[Costi]] is able to do it. It's lined in black felt, and inside is a very large black feather. [[Samuel]] recognizes it, implying it's from [[The Raven Queen]]. [[Costi]] decides to identify it, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] picks up it's extremely holy. It's a [[Raven Queen's Feather]].

According to our read and some interpretations of [[Samuel]], it's used "to do a thing [[The Raven Queen]] would want done, in the way she wants to do it", but that's it. It's to really really fuck undead. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], "Student protest targeted [[Costi]]. He played his part well. Friend of [[Marina Alduchev]], [[Everlynd]], took responsibility. If there's any way to save her life, please do." He responded, "Understood, I'll do everything I can. Tell him we heard, and I'm sorry. That can't have been easy, but we're proud."

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "[[Costi]] loves feather!! [[Colvia Ghul]] hijacked carriage re: [[Burston Courtev]]. Threatened to tell the [[Eberronian First Division]], delayed until return. We 'confessed' [[Viliki]]-related + we killed him, details light. Oops?", she responds, "Tell him to use carefully. Would be best to keep [[Colvia Ghul]] from fuller knowledge, she cannot be trusted to not spoil plans. What was threat?". [[Rez]] clarified "Threatened to reveal we killed [[Burston Courtev]], upsetting people in the First / making us (our loved ones) a target. We were like, unsanctioned necromancy IS illegal." she responds, "Hmmâ€¦ still, [[Burston Courtev]] seems to have friends in the [[Eberronian First Division]]. No reason for you to make additional enemies, obfuscate everything with [[Colvia Ghul]] regarding our plans."

We decide to at least learn what the curse on the [[Ring of the Undead Masses]] before we know whether to use it. [[Freya]] puts it on. She doesn't want to take it off, but we don't find any other obvious impacts yet. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] warns her that [[The Curator]] may be particularly interested in this. [[Freya]] ruminates that it feels fundamentally similar to [[The Curator]] but of different origin or make. Talking to them, they confirm they don't know anything about it. The don't the curse. They won't come to see her tonight. But they do remember they owe her information, and they are close. 

[[Freya]] tries to flirt with our driver to learn more about him, he's not interested. 

Around the campfire that night, [[Costi]] apologizes to [[Hugh|Finn]] for talking to him as he did, he felt like it was the only way to help them. [[Hugh|Finn]] feels like 'the show' could be something different. He thinks it's a tired narrative to be dismissive of him. [[Costi]] is willing to try but warns it will suck no matter what. [[Hugh|Finn]] prefers [[Costi]] not be mean, however that must happen. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks [[Rez]] if she's noticed that the whole group seems to be focusing on the two of them being together. [[Rez]] was oblivious but now that makes a lot of sense. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] says it's been happening, and [[Rez]] says it must be because they'd be good together - doesn't she agree? [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is noncommittal. [[Rez]] twists the group teasing her about not pulling off the fake dating prank to pulling it over on the group. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is not amused.

[[Hugh|Finn]] admits to [[Costi]] and [[Freya]] that he threatened [[Elena]] after she tried to slip something into his pocket. He went outside to talk to her, but she was not helpful. [[Costi]] says he doesn't even know what the letter contained. [[Hugh|Finn]] was angry because [[Elena]] didn't seem to trust him, [[Costi]] say's that's warranted right now. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] says the [[TrueSilver]] said they weren't compatible, and we're a little uncertain what that means. "How can [[Costi]] let [[Elena]] know that he still wants liberation for [[Eberron]] without compromising our cover". [[Costi]] thinks maybe that just means she can't be trusted, but he also failed on proving he could be trusted. We debate how to talk to our gods and if random visions and riddles count. Sometimes? Don't tell [[Rez]] that.

We travel throughout [[Eberron]] on our way to the border, to enter the [[Turian Waste]].
