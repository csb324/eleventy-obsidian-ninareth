# Detailed Notes: Session 125

Leaving the maze, we all go with [[Marigold]] to get a drink. [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] grabs [[Hugh|Finn]] to pull him aside, and says in about 2 hours, after the introduction, that the [[Made Fors]] perform, percussion. The dance is largely improvisation. Begrudgingly, he agrees. 

Back at the bar [[Marigold]] offers [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] a green powder, telling us that it would mean a lot if we can partake, but have to keep it together. Eventually, we all shoot. When [[Hugh|Finn]] comes back, [[Marigold]] finds out about the show and offers to help him practice. 

The rest of discuss our plans, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] a little bit tipsily. She announces she's going to go break up with [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] and it's FINE. [[Rez]] tries to cast invisibility but forgets she stopped that ability, then begs [[Costi]] for a favor. He can't make her invisible, but uses his new ability to pass along spells to let her alter herself. Turning into a cheap poor copy of [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]], [[Rez]] follows. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] has a bit of a time trying to find him, and first finds [[Lance Corporal Walmond]], one of his advisors. A tall pale half-elf with sandy blonde hair. It's a strange strange conversation, and [[Rez]] gleefully loiters nearby, in her alias as [[Private Allnutz]]. 

She makes him promise not to fall in love with her, because love is a mistake, and she thinks they both know that. He agrees, and they kiss. Then continue. [[Rez]] only sticks around a few seconds longer than she should. 

[[Freya]] is getting drunker and drunker, regaling semi-willing seat neighbors with gruung-slayer stories. [[Costi]] half listens while snaring [[Rez]]'s chair. When she threatens to kill him for vomiting up her lendith, [[Costi]] tries to get help from an attendant, making it very clear that he's not in charge of this situation. 

Meanwhile, [[Hugh|Finn]] remembers a lizardfolk, [[Nikab]], who taught him to dance many many years ago. While he stops himself from remembering how that story ends, he does remember how to dance. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], prepping for her show, tries to clear herself of her drugs, but realizes that there's nothing to clear. She was, placeboed? Pissed, she comes to meet us for a pre-show shot.

Only to find [[Rez]] getting got by the snare, but leans into it, turning it into rope acrobatics, with the minorly unfortunate accidental nudity. It's only fair, as after escaping, she toasts with [[Marigold]] to a prank well-played. 

Suddenly, we hear rolling thunder across the theatre, blue lightning crashing around, as the curtains open on [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]].

She plays the sexiest version of the [[Eberron]] national anthem to have ever existed, that flows into a modern military song, leading into [[Fingers]] grand entrance. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] joins on stage and pins her, formally promoting her. 

The [[Made Fors]] go next, taking their fighting prowess into musicality. [[Hugh|Finn]] does quite well. 

[[Trisha]] invites us to the afterparty, and hints for [[Costi]] to be well prepared. So we all work on freshening him up and giving him unsolicited advice both helpful and unhelpful on our walk over. 

Entering into a vibey club atmosphere, and are greeted with a box of drugs. Getting the run down, [[Freya]] randomly chose a drug [[Mortality]] that should have her experience death and rebirth. [[Baste]], that's basically an experience enhancer, [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] partake. This one is real, she promises, owning up to both the prank and spying. 

[[Trisha]] comes to borrow [[Costi]], asking [[Hugh|Finn]]'s permission which gives [[Costi]] the unfortunate realization that he IS his minder now. Fuck. Then introduces him to [[Fingers]]. Her initial skepticism soon resolves, and realizes they may share a thing or two in common. 

[[Fingers]] makes quite the show of leaving with [[Costi|Constantine]]. The rest of us cheer him on, then go dance, [[Freya]] drops 'dead'. She's literally fine. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] even comes to dress up her comatose body. 

We're in the midst of a grindy dancing mess, when [[Hugh|Finn]] asks if we're having a sleepover. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] check in, and try to get him to scope out people here, but he's not interested. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] runs away to play harp under the stars, and [[Hugh|Finn]] goes with her. They discuss whether love is worth it or not, and she dismisses his attempts to reassure her she could find someone. She's not swayed, and tells him music couldn't hurt her, so that is where she should invest in. 

[[Freya]] comes to with [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] watching over her. He shares his story about using it in military combat, she shares about her actual death choices. That's not something everyone has, but they divert and go to join dance. 

[[Rez]] heads out with [[Trisha]] - they have a wonderful night. [[Costi]] and [[Fingers]] have a grand time as well. [[Freya]] and [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] have an aggressive but normal time. [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talk until the early morning debating whether love is worth it. 

We reconvene and pack up in the morning. [[Trisha]] comes to get us, and after our typical bullshit, we go to board. [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] says goodbye to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], it's strained, but he says he'll see us soon. Hate to see it bud. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says he expects to see us before a month is out, and that [[Marigold]] will be there soon. 

It will just be [[Dania]], [[Trisha]], [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], and [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. We expect smooth sailing, and can speak freely, but should always be prepared for 'turbulence'.

[[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Dania]] talk about the air elementals contract, it's given short trips back, and perhaps that is worse? It's a cheerful conversation. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] scries on [[Starstool Daygrip]], to check in on [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] machinations, but he can't get a clear image. We discuss who might be good to check in on, and decide on [[Petra]]. He sees her alone, in a snowy heavily wooded area. She is moving through the landscape, following a path, before she kills 4 deer and walks them back in the direction she came. 

Around 3 in the morning, as we are nearing [[Jezeten]], the airship plummets several hundred feet before [[Trisha]] wakes us all up yelling, "dragon!"
