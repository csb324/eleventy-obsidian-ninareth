# Detailed Notes: Session 101

We stare down a small narrow stone passage, as we start down the stairs single-file. It looks roughly hewn, not long-standing or finely built, ideally built for a smaller figure but designed that larger can get through. Pretty immediately we note a piece of stone trap, a trip wire against the top of the wall, and a funnel with another mechanical trap. We pause, [[Costi]] alarms the tunnel and [[Freya]] sets up a snare.

As we progress, we encounter a small cavern with a thin gap in the floor with a stream running through it. It enters through a tunnel and exits on a similar tunnel on the other side. [[Samuel]] goes down and notices a swirling pattern that is strange. 

[[Freya]] piles [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] into [[My Hole]], and plans to crawl around the wall and let us out on the other side. As she travels, something in the water lashes out at her, grappling her. An incorporeal form, like a bone tail made of mist, wraps around her. She throws [[My Hole]] to other side so we can get out if needed, right before she's yanked off the wall and pulled into the water.  The rest of us break out to try and help, as she punches through it and frees herself. As we try to hurry out of the room, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is able to sense that it's at least partially undead. 

As we start to progress, [[Costi]] suggests [[Rez]] use her bag of mischief to trap a trap, but she gets distracted by a new riddle from [[Hugh]]. In the pause, [[Freya]] notices even more that the tunnel is intentionally designed to look like it's built for small figures yet totally easy to move as a larger figure. It's suspicious. [[Rez]] lays down some oil and we all move on.

We eventually reach a larger room with four pedestals, in a diamond-esqe shape. They are also roughly hewn, and are about 2 feet tall. On top of each, there is a horizontal dagger and some inscriptions. [[Freya]] says they are actually on the compass lines.

N (draconic): Sun crests here, at the end of the day. Red cracked clay, where fisherman stay -- [[Arkhosia (City)]]

E (common): Oceans and bridges, plenty of these - where brigands run rough-shod o'r ships and the seas -- [[The Tendrils]]

S (elvish): Under the sewers, carving new grooves. Hands of fine metal make powerful moves. -- [[Thelran Asari]]

W (draconic): dust storm and danger, lightning strikes true. Mauratock, and rubies, and sapphires too. -- [[Turian Waste]]

[[Costi]] remembers that the founding of [[The Silver Hand]] was tied to [[Morthos]]. He's not sure where it was founded, it's believed either in [[Thelran Asari]] or [[Quaath]], where [[Opal (silver hand)]] had the strongest foothold.

Looking around the room, [[Hugh]] notices a purposefully roughly carved (as though intentionally created to look like it was done by a child) of a sketch of [[Ninarith]] with the pedestals aligning the map. 

The daggers are magically affixed to the pedestals. We turn them towards the locations we associate, and with a click, a new passageway opens to a large new chamber. With high ceilings, we hear water lapping on the side. As we leave, [[Costi]] tries to obfuscate what we did and moves them all to random locations with a mage hand. 

As we look around, the first thing we notice is the large amounts of blood. It's mostly dried, like an unclean build up. The room itself seems like a natural cavern, in the center of the room is necromancy equipment and tools. Two statues are on either side of the room, soldiers in military poses. The water on the edge of the room drops off into the sea. Looking more closely, nothing immediately jumps out. There are some unoccupied bedrolls, about 15, and cheap weapons on the side. 

After defeating the statues turned golems and hidden skeletons, we try to look around the room. The statues seem enchanted, seem to pretty nice, both expensive and requiring high-level magic. The coffins don't lead anywhere. [[Hugh]] scrapes some of the blood from the floor. [[Costi]] notices that there's a hidden passageway by the bay.

Looking out at the water, [[Freya]] notices a bit of rope bobbing in the waves. She pulls about 6 feet, and can see the end was cut recently. We discuss potentially taking a short rest, but decide to look through the secret passageway first. [[Costi]] finds a trap and the way to open it, he disarms it but it's surprisingly adept. 

We debate what to do, and end up with [[Samuel]] scouting ahead - [[Costi]] going through his eyes sees an arching staircase, through side entrances twice, and eventually exits on the [[Breakers Bay]] cliffside. We see there's some cliff paths before we lose sight.

Deciding to keep on keeping on, we attach together with rope. We step out onto a small ledge, to the right and up is some of the [[Fishermen]] platforms, we head to the left and below. We climb. for a moment before it comes to an end. [[Hugh]] seems to notice a light, or some sort of boat, out on the water from where we are. 

We decide [[Costi]] will send an arcane eye to investigate. Fighting the rain, he's eventually able to squeeze the eye through a small hole into the interior of ship. He sees a man in dark clothing like the mercenary men we saw in [[Building 17]] , and two women in [[Eberronian Military]] uniforms, and they guarding a large wooden box. He tries to memorize their faces, and recognizes one of the women from the barracks. One is a private, one a corporal. 

Resting on the cliff face, we watch through the arcane eye as the box they're on top of moves, the mercenary bangs on it and it stops shaking. We start discussing if there's anything else we can do.

[[Rez]] turns [[Hugh]] invisible, and [[Costi]] ghostly gazes himself before casting another arcane eye. The goal to let [[Hugh]] be able to locate object and let [[Costi]] see into the box and determine who (or what) it is. Getting around 20 feet away, he's able to see a number of distinguishing factors, and thinks it will be enough for the future. Slipping the eye back through, [[Costi]] can tell there's a body in the box, that looks almost exactly like the vampire we just fought. 

Realizing this was our one chance to make someone fly, [[Hugh]] bundles everyone up in [[My Hole]] and flies us up over the top of the cliff and back to [[The Mountain's Kiss]]. After running out the last one, we decide [[Costi]] should wait 45 minutes and then try again, hoping to catch whatever they're waiting on. 

He's just able to catch as the ship starting to head in, and the vampire is now out of the coffin looking perfectly healthy. It goes into the same cove we were in, and as they de-ship they're annoyed by our damage to the room. The vampire seems to be in charge, but the mercenary seems to be a bit annoyed by this. After a few minutes, the group gets back on the ship but the vampire turns into a bat and flies up into holes of the rock. 

We decide to report everything aside from our suspicions of the [[Eberronian Military]] and the boat to confirm what we know the vampire knows of us. One of the civilian's we were investigating was so suspicious we approached her home, and detected an undead in there, she had mercenaries inside, including a vampire who attacked us and started a fire. We fought some protections, didn't find any other immediate leads. We fled into a tunnel we found, they seemed to be built for children, there was a necromancy lab inside. We fought some protections, didn't find any other immediate leads. We believe [[Shay]] might be [[Shari]], she shouldn't act but we feel very confident she's on the right lead and we'll be able to bring them in. 

Before bed, [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talk about her adjustment to being back in the action and whether or not we're taking too many risks. She talks a bit about what her afterlife was, but despite it being mostly pleasant, seems to be focused on staying alive so she can take care of her responsibilities here. 

[[Costi]] takes the [[Circlet of Sending]] to [[Pruvki Forgaveat]] "[[Viliki]] military believes [[ELA]] possibly behind harpy attacks, because [[ELA]] in nearby mountains. Maybe opportunity to plant information for [[ELA]], if there, you're warned", he responds "Understood, thank you for information. Be safe"

Finally, we go to bed.

In the morning, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] apologizes to [[Hugh]] for threatening to kill [[Costi]] in her attempt to get him not to take risks. They make up, and talk about the importance of taking each other at our words. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] also offers [[Hugh]] help on healing [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]].

We head to the [[Ratoucha]] and on the way we hear lots of people talking about the fire that burned 3 houses. We ask [[Lara Frozenwatcher]] to help arrange a meeting with [[Security Director Aldi]]. We also ask her to provide as much information on vampires as is possible, she says she'll do what we can. Asking if we'd heard about the fires, we try to diffuse but give a small nod to our efforts. [[Hugh]] works on putting some chaos on our map.

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Halv]], "Halv, this is a ghostly message. The group you jumped must meet with Shari TONIGHT. This is for ghostly reasons beyond your comprehension. Reply back." He responds, "oh, okay Mr. Ghost sure. Yea, well I don't know that I can make that happen really, I mean I'm just a guy, I can". [[Rez]] responds, "Ghost mind talk is hard (but cool). Fewer words. Time? Location? They will meet the most important person you find. But it must be TONIGHT." "i'm SO sorry. Okay. 8. [[Founding Flagon]] back, shoot, out back. Outside behind the [[Founding Flagon]] at 8. Did okay, was that -"

After two hours, [[Lara Frozenwatcher]] says she's heard nothing from [[Security Director Aldi]] - he hasn't been heard from in the last two days. [[Costi]] asks if someone can sending to him, she'll try. We ask if he has a deputy but she says she wouldn't trust anyone else to be as involved, plus the [[Eberronian Military]] is who is mostly involved in the city. We ask her opinion, she considers him competent, he's run things for about 5 years, seems to think of him as a good guy. We ask about people who knew the sanctioned necromancers, and she says they're all single... and a touch creepy. But tells us that [[Zesnel Ponner]] was small, either a halfling or gnomes.

She's able to get us a memo on vampires, [[Costi]] dives into it. It's slim but shares that vampires are undead that retain a high-degree of their previous personality. Most believe more than essentially any other kind of undead, which also some people to change without anyone realizing. They're extremely capable physically, with increased strength, dexterity, and constitution and intellect as well - once they're out of their spawn phase. True vampires can make spawn. They are known to regenerate quickly from physical wounds and some have magic, but all are strong martial warriors. Many can shape change, normally into bats or rats, some bigger animals. They can charm, but different powers manifest across individuals. They can't be killed in conventional ways, but will eventually die if you can prevent them from getting to a safe place to regenerate. They can't cross running water and dislike sunlight, though they can walk in it. Their bite could transfer vampirism, but they're not sure how to do it fully. 

We get a transcription of a sending sent to [[Security Director Aldi]], "Undercover, on mission. Do not bother me or the [[Viliki Guard]], thank you"

Taking a walk to the coastline, [[Hugh]] tries to locate object on the ship from the night before - it is below us but much deeper than before, we think they sank it. We debate swimming down to look at it, and it turns to a theory [[Rez]] is scared of the ocean - she's not. We go off on several tangents, agree to swim when we next can, and pivot to hot springs then an accidental revelation from [[Freya]] about [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] threatening to put her in jail. 

We decide to kill the afternoon playing drinking games, and meet up with [[Garida]]. After almost killing her with 4 hit points, the group orchestrates her win before she goes to sleep off her drinks before dinner. As the place fills up, we here more information - a neighbor elderly man died in one of the houses, named Calet. The [[Eberronian Military]] has said it's a robbery gone wrong, likely by [[Shari's Boys]]. [[Building 17]] was the original house, the Taut-Velma house, but they've been gone for months. 

[[Hugh]] starts to spiral upon hearing this news, and he and [[Costi]] have a conversation about trying to help others but keep the bigger picture in mind - we couldn't have stopped that fire and the people who set it, the necromancers, are to blame. Not us.

Right before 8, we head out back. [[Rez]] is invisible. [[Hugh]] sees a barrel with the lid askew, there's a note with an address in the southern part of the city. We head there, and find a dark building. After we panic and fuck around for a minute, [[Hugh]] knocks on the door - with no response we head in. 

It's dark inside, [[Costi]] casts light and several doors open as multiple people come into the area. There's a mix of ages, from a child to an adult non-taxpaying man, 4 people in total. An older man with a crossbow seems to be the leader. They take our weapons, and ask why we went through [[Halv]] - they seem to stick with ghost story, much to [[Rez]]'s delight. 

Eventually, when met with resistance for us to meet [[Shari]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] shares that there's an ongoing crime they're being framed for - and we want to help them if they'll help us. He calls us out on the ghost lie, not referencing an invisible [[Rez]], but agrees not to tell [[Halv]]. 

It's clear they're messaging, and a spider crawls out. We're given the clear to go see her. Lead through a multi-locked door, then down into a basement, where 10 people wait for us. A woman in her forties, who's aging poorly, with thinning hair and some scars on her face steps forward. It's [[Shari]]. She gives us three minutes to explain our situation.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] shares we were hired by the [[Eberronian Second Division]] to root out unsanctioned necromancy. That we believe [[Shari's Boys]] is being framed, and that we'd like to work together - they shouldn't be punished for what they didn't do, and we can root out corruption. [[Freya]] jumps in to say we can be sure her members will keep both hands. 

She asks how we know they're being framed. We reference the tunnel, allude to other signs,  how they were blamed for the fire, and that the [[Eberronian Military]] has said they think it's at the fault of their group. When [[Costi]] chimes in, she spends an odd amount of time staring at him. She's almost confused with a glint of recognition, but doesn't say anything.

They ask what we propose. We point out [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]]'s intensity, and they say they have a lucrative business contract with her.  They reveal that they provide the parts for the necromancy, but they have shipment coming to her soon. [[Rez]] says this seems like a bad business deal where [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]]might want to throw them under the bus to save her skin, or maybe she's gotten as much as she needs, but either way it's a dead deal. [[Shari]] says great, that we can make the next drop off. 

She says some of her boys will lead us there, then leave. When we're worried about enough evidence, she says we'll have plenty where they meet up. They deliver to her personal lab, underneath the barracks. 

[[Costi]] asks for more intel on who else is involved in the [[Eberronian Military]] in exchange for payment, she asks for 200 gp. She makes a pointed comment about his parents, but denies knowing [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]. When we mentioned the two junior officers we know, she reduces to 150gp. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to lead her to give more information on [[Costi's Dad]], saying our ties are not to [[Eberron]], and [[Rez]] says we can be a replacement business partner. [[Shari]] responds that things have been better in [[Viliki]] since the [[Baron Pendaras Nushkev]] has stepped back. She gives us more motive on [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]]. 

She tells us to meet her tomorrow at 10:30 here. [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] is normally not alone at their drop offs, and she's heard she's a talented swordswoman. They don't know anything about [[Shay]], but have suffered some losses as a group. She confirms [[Simin]] and [[Mim]] are dead, they found their bodies. They sold their parts to [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]]. As we're about to leave, [[Hugh]] asks how much to buy [[Halv]]. [[Shari]] says 78gp, but maybe we should be sure we don't die first - she can put it in a trust for him. [[Hugh]] buys it.

We leave, and immediately check for tails. We have one for a moment, but lose them going through the square. Heading back to [[The Mountain's Kiss]], [[Hugh]] wants to commune with [[TrueSilver]] to see if we can trust [[Shari's Boys]] with our plan. 
* Can we trust [[Shari's Boys]] in our sting operation tomorrow? Almost entirely
* Is [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] working to further the same ends, the army of undeath, as we encountered in the [[Heal the Anchor Tree]]? Perhaps
* Can you help ferry Calet to a happy safe place? [[Hugh]] feels like the answer is yes, with his active help - though he's unsure what they require. He surrenders to the feeling. 

[[Costi]] and [[Rez]] work on breaking the cipher we found on [[Building 17]]. It a series of orders given to those mercenaries, signed [[Shari]]. [[Costi]] also identifies those boots, they are [[Boots of Misty Step]], when attuned you can cast misty step twice.
