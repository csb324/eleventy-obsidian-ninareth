# Session 167

We walk through town towards [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]]. The city has grown and changed over the last several hundred years, but the Academy remains gorgeous, magically-enhanced campus grounds with sigiled gold and silver walls. There's a huge marble statue of [[Headmistress Seravana]], who died in [[The Second Sundering]]

[[Samson]] says that where he was from was called [[Home]], because they didn't know anywhere else existed. Turns out it was a bit of a cult in general, and now there are continental powers who are talking about renaming it. Most homelanders will be making their way mainland, as it's gotten pretty bad there. It was a magical utopia for about 17,000 (!!) years, before recorded history. That was happening because they were pulling magic from all the rest of the world. Without all of that magic, things deteriorated quickly after that.

[[Freya]] and [[Samson]] share some similarities: restrained upbringing locations, exes, and bathtub liquor. Fast friends!

[[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]] and the [[Boulder Makers Counterattack]] 
* [[Zmaj]] has arrived in [[Thelran Asari]], he's helping with tunnels to get into an underground cave near the [[Boulder Makers]]
* In about 3 days, we'll surround and attack:
	* [[Eirian|E]]'s crew will draw attention from a back entrance
	* [[The Unforged Few]] and [[Vask]] will go through the main entrance - we're supposed to be seen coming
	* [[Zmaj]] and [[Zalvaris|Zalv]] will be behind the tunnels in the main chambers to join us
* There's between 20 and 50 there
* [[Bhula Orbnose]] is in [[Thelran Asari]] here now
* The [[Thelran Asari]] guard will help raid [[Pleetos Alentas]] estate after our attack
* There's been no info on [[Zilbar Saplegople]] but [[Nebrur Sunbreaker]] is in the [[Frontier]] and involved somehow in sourcing creatures for the Arena

[[Eirian]] will introduce [[Freya]] and [[Farybar]] - he'll meet us at our hotel this evening. 

[[Samson]] tells us about the two people who were pretending to be gods: [[Gosar]] and [[Elgen]]. The captured the magic over [[Home]] with a powerful enchanted dome, it consolidated the weave so magic was limitless and enhanced. The dome then gained consciousness, named [[Caloren]], and wanted to teleport off the [[Prime Material]]. There was a void surrounding them that had multiple tears, bringing creatures and items from multiple [[Planes of existence]]. 

[[Kaloren]] wrote the letter to [[Sezathkathon]], which had the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]. [[Samson]] gave us a copy:

[[Kaloren's Letter to Sezathkathon]]:
	[[Kaloren]] -
	I'm so thrilled to hear that our suggestions helped bridge your most recent research blockage. We have found that a willing participant serves as a much more effective conduit for the Derival Plinth's energy; a thrall serves in a pinch, but you waste so much effort forcing them to assist you. Having them volunteer leads to less spillage. This should mean you're close to making your next attempt, correct? Do you have a date set? We'd like to watch the skies to ensure we can follow your ongoing efforts, even from half a world away! Additionally, I wanted to let you know that your advice has once again born fruit. An indirect approach, while somewhat wasteful (it seems waste of magical energy is becoming a theme of this message!) has allowed us to circumvent her quite significant barriers, and we are making excellent progress. Barring any significant delays, I suspect we'll have finalized crystals--improved upon the most recent batch we sent you--within the month! Good luck with your ascension, and I hope to have followers in your name leading prayer groups in our camps soon. 
	As Ever, Under the Eye, Your Friend [[Sezathkathon]]

[[Samson]] tells us about his magical divorce making him powerless, until he picked up a sword and fell into a lake with a [[Kraken]] who wanted to come to the [[Prime Material]], and needed help, in exchange giving [[Samson]] power. We get a whole scoop about his ex [[Rill]] and her new wife [[Vani]] and the messy messy implosion of his last marriage. 

Once he got here he realized the [[Kraken]] was going to hurt a lot of people, wanted to come into [[Yent Lake]] - he lost his power, again. He's in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] but is pretty upset with [[Samson]] and will likely be sending folks after him. 

After that, he was laying in bed and saw a woman in a very hot room with butterfly wings, who said something like, "[[Samson]] you're involved in things bigger than you join me and I'll help you join [[Sezathkathon]]". He's part of the [[Cult of the Butterfly Queen]]. [[Samson]]'s realized he's a good window for powerful beings. She was very helpful with scoping out the [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]]. 

We wonder if [[Samson]] is a [[Synchrona]]. He says he can ask [[Gosar]] and [[Elgen]] if they've heard of this. We decide it's too big of a risk. [[Eirian]] notes how the concentration of the Weave seemed to tie into the planar overlap. 

An airship expedition has already gone, captained by [[Bigseeker]]. News of [[Home]] is spreading. [[Eirian|E]] knows some from folks from [[Durmask]] and [[Ru'Nileth]] have sent folks too. 

We have [[Hugh|Finn]] try to scry on [[Sezathkathon]] using his letter, but it wouldn't work. 

[[Eirian]] knows [[Rieltar]], he's in bad shape now. Drunk, sold most of his items, no longer with [[The Burning Sons]]. [[Eirian]] says he mostly spends his time in [[The Barrels]]. 

[[Ghez Yhutl]] says he wants to talk to [[Rez]], secretly. He's been asked to become a [[Onyx Scale]], part of the sneaky folks, an extremely well-kept secret, of the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]]. [[Rez]] is SO PROUD OF HIM. He goes to service at the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Thelran Asari]] and made friends, ended up fighting with them, eventually went on a number of jobs for them, and then was officially inducted. 

[[Eirian]] recommends a pretty powerful conjuration wizard who is her recommendation on someone who can help with [[diamond goo]], [[Grym Wildbranch]]. He's guest lecturing at [[The Slavaadi College]], and will be back in [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]] in a few months. She also recommends [[Pashai's Spell Emporium]] for magic scrolls, saying he'll only rip us off a little. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] wants to go visit [[Nadia]] with [[Costi]]. An elderly gnome with a long beard and bushy eyebrows answers the door, it's [[Yenrick Elderflower]]. He funds the [[ELA]] and is extremely cavalier talking about it. He invests in various projects around [[Thelran Asari]]. 

[[Nadia]] gets pranked by [[Costi]] but knifes him. [[Costi]] tries to surprise her with gear to [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]], she diverts with talking about the concept of performance more broadly with [[Redscale]]. It's a little unclear if that's her real preference or if she's hedging her bets on not getting into the Academy. [[Costi]] tells her a bit about the [[Night of Storms]], reassures [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] and [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] are okay, and says [[Duke v'Dharinov]] is a pretty good guy. She asks him to take her on a tour of the city, and asks for him to look out for any girls her age she can be friends with. 

Meanwhile, [[Hugh|Finn]] decides to go pay a visit to [[Eva Sidorev|Eva]]. He anxiously sits outside her house for a few hours, but she doesn't seem to be home. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Rez]], and [[Freya]] decide to go buy spells for [[Costi]]. We get a sending and dispel magic for [[Costi]]. Then go have [[Freya]] check in with the [[Wayfinders]]. On the way, they figure out the paper trail and the amount of money that would be warranted for that. We decide on 2k GP. 

We arrive at the [[Equinox Citadel]], the main [[Wayfinders]] headquarters in [[Thelran Asari]]. The building is much less ornate than the surrounding structures, more natural and simple, stacked limestone. [[Freya]] is recognized on sight. We get checked in by a young earnest [[Wayfinders]] trainee named [[Kiveth]]. [[Freya]] immediately clocks another firbolg, this one yellow and orange, named [[Lirnis Kilzire]]. He's prepped to speak to [[Freya]] and escorts us to a room to chat. 

He shares that he handles a lot of the daily responsibilities at the [[Equinox Citadel]], and was assigned watching out for [[Freya]] by [[Gulsindip Desindever|Superior Desindever]]. [[Freya]] gets her [[Thelran Asari]] stamp, mentions that she is connected to the new [[Duke v'Dharinov]]. It seems like her keynote speech might be funny coming from a trainee, so they're going to do a work around teleporting her nearby to a city, have [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] hire her to trek into the town, and then have us get brought back. They say to have us tell them when and where she wants to go. 

[[Lirnis Kilzire]] gives [[Freya]] a bit of a rundown, [[Gulsindip Desindever|Superior Desindever]] will speak the first night, [[Freya]] will take the middle night, and [[Thelran Asari Council]] [[Chair Rascryn Lemblehamble]] will close the final night. There will be a few thousand participants attending. 

We learn about [[Lirnis Kilzire]] talks about how his tribe of firbolg were displaced when [[Zilvengrod]] was built up, followed a group of [[Wayfinders]] until his community became based in [[Tinkate]]. It led to the dissolution of his tribe over time. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] remembers how the area was tied to new mining of [[refined firestone]] and tied to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. As we leave [[Freya]] leaves notes asking to connect as soon as several people arrive: [[Akros]], [[Rawley]], and [[Naya]]. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] volunteers herself to share a room with [[Freya]]. NBD. [[Freya]] tries to climb into her bed, it doesn't go over well. She does tell her about [[Zilvengrod]] and it's ties to [[refined firestone]], plus the reminder of [[Cinder]] and the [[Fire Raisers]] sending [[refined firestone]] to several locations across the town. 

Before bed, [[Hugh|Finn]] sends:
* [[Dania]]: Hello, first day in [[Thelran Asari]]. It’s very large. Saw [[Nadia]]. Tried to convince her to go to the [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]]. How was your day
	* I haven’t been in a long time! I need to visit, have recs for me please. I unsurprisingly worked, meeting with some merchant leaders still.
* [[Eva Sidorev|Eva]]: I’m in the city……….(rest of sending is just a long pause)
	* Well we should get dinner!

[[Rez]] also sends:
* [[Zmaj]] - MANDATORY sibling night on the town tomorrow!! Don't be a grump.  Bring [[Zalvaris]] — he needs it. [[Eirian|E]] knows where.
	* We’ll see. There’s still plenty of work to do, but if things go well I can stop by.
* [[Zalvaris]] - MANDATORY sibling night on the town tomorrow!! Force [[Zmaj]] to come. We'll wipe the rest of them from existence afterwards.
	* That sounds perfect, [[Rez]]. A night out with the coppers is exactly what I need right now.
* [[Vask]] - MANDATORY sibling night on the town tomorrow!! You gotta meet this weird little guy [[Eirian]]'s messing around with. He's working for Aunt [[Gemma]]! 
	* WAIT REALLY?!? I WANNA ASK HIM LOTS OF QUESTIONS. I’m in.
