# Detailed Notes: Session 157

We wake up to find invitations to [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]]'s promotion party, at 7pm on [[ELA Day of Action]]. 

[[Freya]] pitches her new pie shop, [[Binky's]], to [[Rez]]. She's intrigued and they try to make a dinner reservation but there's any 

[[Hugh|Finn]] pulls [[Rez]] aside for a chat, that's really more like a lecture. He tells [[Rez]] her wrote the letter from [[Trisha]] to test how serious [[Rez]] felt about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. He tells [[Rez]] that he can read people, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] has been hurt before and she has serious feelings. She's not a game, she's a person, and [[Rez]] needs to be more serious than she's been about anything else in her life. [[Rez]] is not receptive, tries to pivot, and when that doesn't work - leaves. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] checks in on what that was about, did [[Hugh|Finn]] try to give her a lesson on love and speaking her heart? [[Rez]] is relieved that she's not alone in this ambushing, and vents (maybe not in her most sensitive way) about what unsolicited advice [[Hugh|Finn]] gave. Lessons were not learned by either [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] or [[Rez]]. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] talks about the bombs and [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]]'s plan, how to find the new stationing of the [[Eberronian First Division]], a plan to manipulate [[Marius A]], and decide to talk to [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]]. 

[[Nadia]] has been moved out of [[Jezeten]], she's staying with [[Aunt Elderflower]] in [[Thelran Asari]]. [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] agrees with [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] that the bombs were the best call, but there is a back up plan - but is more dangerous to civilian life. She says the people in the tenements are defenseless, for now. [[Hugh|Finn]] argues they are too hurt, and are in no shape to fight. She felt the vampire plan was the best they had, but now they will distribute the violence outside of the [[Stormwall district]]. If we can't find where the [[Eberronian First Division]], they will recall the bombs and put them on the edge of the [[Stormwall district]] in evacuated tenements -- and allow the storm to come. 

They're working with a few of the leaders of the tenement unions, those who can act quickly will be the ones targeted. The aim is to collapse 5 buildings. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] tries to ask [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] to stay out of the fight - she finds it condescending and says she will only do so, if [[Costi]] will join her. When he refuses, she shares that she's leaving the city tonight. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] casts some sendings on the way back:

To [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]: "Still not in jail? Just checking. Heard your wife is making her way to you. Do not die in the next few days", he responds, "Still not in jail, my friend! She’s heading elsewhere, I won’t see her until next Songsday. Keep him alive, and keep yourself alive too."

To [[Dania]]: "Are you busy tonight. I would like to grab a drink before everything", she replies, "Tonight, I cannot, but I would like that as well. Sunsday I have a day off, and could be taken for a drink." [[Hugh|Finn]] continues, "Done. I’ll send a message of where to meet. Unless you have a suggestion?", she says, "No, you surprise me."

[[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]] notice that the guards seem on high alert, escalated even from earlier in the morning. One of them is [[Geuka]], one of [[Marius A]]'s friends. They try to ask what's happened, but she can't share much - something happened in the [[Duchal District]]. They are shutting down the gates and told to detain anyone suspicious. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] all meets up at home, and catches up. We decide to head to the [[Duchal District]] and check out what's been going on. Making ourselves known to a guard, she gets approval and sends us on the [[Palace Dharinov]] to learn more. A porter greets us and moves us right inside, but we are going through to a new area, separate from where [[Jehneim Bastienev]] has previously met with us. 

[[Colvia Ghul]] enters the room. We all immediately crash out and start to panic. She says what she can share, [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] has escaped. It seems like some powerful creature who was under it's thrall found it's way to him, and it broke him out. They've already escaped the city, the [[Bone Breakers]] are in pursuit. We ask if the bone claw was theirs, but she summons them to confirm it's hers. We needle a bit on [[Jehneim Bastienev]] kept him from her, and shares the story of how it came to be. 

[[Colvia Ghul]] had a mentor once - he had aspirations, goals he believed were right. She was given a task, in his goal, to ascend to lichhood. A simple mis-dotted room is enough to ruin it, she intentionally did it wrong so as to trap him through his failure. She calls him [[Pergy]], saying he doesn't deserve his name. He was in his mid 70s at the time. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gets a read that [[Colvia Ghul]] genuinely did not think this guy should be a lich, but it was more self motivated than for good. It seems like her relationship with him is deeply complicated, there's hate, and love, and pride all tangled together. 

She asks if we know anything about [[Dobosta Cumunzal]]'s escape, saying how embarrassing it is for [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]]. They took materials to create hundreds of undead, and 15ish (between 7 and 30) other necromancers have escaped with him. It seems like [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] is loosely implicated because it was his men who were on guard. We're very honest that we don't know anything. If we learn more, she asks us to let her know. They are rumblings already that it would require help from the inside.

[[Colvia Ghul]] says she'll see us at the [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]] party, and when we notify them that [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] will be there - he's been to the palace multiple times. She's 'surprised' [[Jehneim Bastienev]] would be forgetful or targeted in not sharing that information. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "Just chatted with [[Colvia Ghul]], but it's all good (SHE MADE THE BONE CLAW!!). Heard about [[Dobosta Cumunzal]]. Congrats? Or should we be worried? LOTS going on!!!", she replies, "Apologies for the surprise, nothing to worry about"

[[Costi]] starts to try and put some threads together, wondering why [[The Curator]] said this would help us and who does this serve, regarding [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], [[Dobosta Cumunzal]], and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]]. He mentally disproves that this doesn't benefit [[Dobosta Cumunzal]], or [[Freya]], [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] seemed pretty mad, things are falling into place for both [[ELA]] and the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]]. 

We try for some scrying, we fail on [[Relakas]] again. Wondering about his affiliation in [[Eberron]], we decide to ask [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] if she knows him, "Oh also, copper dragonborn, [[Dragon's Hide|Hidesman]], "[[Relakas]]". Bad guy, in [[Eberron]]? We assume he's with the [[Eberronian First Division]], but do you know him? Not exactly our fan.", she replies, "Ah, yes he arrived in [[Eberron City]] a few weeks ago. Consulting under [[Sven]] in the 7th, not sure on what. Been preoccupied."

The next day, [[Marius A]] is going to come near us for dinner near our house. Afterwards, we will meet [[Marius Lupu]] at [[The Cellar]].  

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] spirals out a bit comparing [[Colvia Ghul]]'s ability to solve her mentor problem in a way she never could, and a mix of envy and shame coloring that thought. She's only fine while playing the harp. 

That evening, we arrive to chat with [[Marius A]]. He's been busy with [[Dobosta Cumunzal]], he's been ordered to not return alive because this is his second escape. He's heard rumors he's affiliated with the [[ELA]], we casually shoot it down. 

We get talking about [[Haag Kitot]] and how many of the [[Stalwart Shields]] who tried to genocide the hobgoblins. We discuss [[Hubris Smallstock]], how those who followed him and the [[Tiamat]] probably deserved to die. He's a huge fan of the history of [[The Three Dragons War]]. We talk about [[The Zumbinis]] for a minute.

[[Costi]] invites him back for a night cap, and [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] all distracts ourselves, so that the boys can have a heart to heart. He starts by sharing that the rest of the party doesn't see [[Eberron]] as they do, seeing the hope and love for the future of [[Eberron]]. He talks about the human farms, the horror of how gaunt and tortured they were, and the abominations were worse than even rumored under the city. That the [[Eberronian First Division]] were keeping them held there, and it goes all the way up to the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. It seems like he took it to heart, he thanked [[Costi]] for telling him and promised they would stick together. 

We head to [[The Cellar]].
