# Detailed Notes: Session 144

We investigate the piles of material left behind when the skeletons collapse, it's a low quality bone dust, but it does look exactly like the remains of [[Un-baby]]. Bone dust is under many of the other bodies, a large amount of dust along the floor. 

Looking at the stakes, they do have runes carved along them, reminding us of [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] invention of [[dimensional anchor]] (4 in long black metal spike covered in runes: use it to be sure that when youâ€™re interacting with items changes dimensions or time, that things stay in place). However, the rune patterns are not the same. These are primarily conjuration runes, though not typical ones, they have elements of chronurgy interwoven in an unknown experimental magic way. 

The other bodies that are boneless did not have holes to indicate they previously had stakes. The ruby staked one forms horribly, goes to attack [[Freya]], who is unbelievably easily able to restrain it - but while it's restrained nothing is growing in that body. However, it did seem to recognize draconic, aside from speaking. 

Investigating the bodies, it does not look like they were struggling when they were dissected, but given the blood patterns it does seem like they were alive through that process.

[[Costi]] asks [[Samuel]] if he would be comfortable touching the ruby stake to find out what it's doing, but refuses to do it himself. 

We discuss that the 5 bodies who have the stakes in them but no bones have stakes that are now inert, they do not have purple cores, and the runes on the side are all different. They seem like failed experts. ses to do it himself.

The silver alloy spike is a magical metal (like adamantine or mithril) as a portion capture within it, however seems mostly silver and there's another metal in it like copper, bronze, or gold. 

[[Rez]] and [[Costi]] coordinate to use mage hand to pull out one of the inert [[necromantic spikes]], the oak. When nothing goes wrong, [[Freya]] yanks out the rest of the inert ones.   

oak - inert, no immediate effect
glass - inert, no immediate effect
coal - inert, no immediate effect
sapphire - inert, no immediate effect
bronze - inert, no immediate effect

Choosing not to leave the magical spikes in the wall, we have [[Freya]] grip the lead box to try and block magic to her while she pulls the active magic items out of the remaining three. 

githyarti wood* - As she pulls the githyarti wood spike, we psychically hear a shrieking in our minds. [[Costi]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] are not effected, the rest of our brains hurt for a minute. As the spike leaves, the bone material rapidly shoots out from the center of it, it grows like dense foliage and vines, bursting quickly before shattering. We clearly ended a process.

unclear silver alloy* - Another scream sounded, and a similar visual effect happened as calcified white hip bones burst out. 

ruby* - There's both physical and magical resistance to removal, as the purple core starts to glow more, another shriek sounds. When removed, an intense light flares then fades. As the skeleton that last came from it gasps, rolling up to look at [[Freya]], in draconic says "kill me". We end his suffering. 

[[Rez]] tries to sneak to pop into the larder, but is naturally bad at stealthing in this instance. Approaching the entrance there is a strong terrible smell. Inside, there is large amounts, hundred of pounds, of rotting food. A sound is right on the edge of [[Rez]]'s awareness, she creeps into the room. A humanoid form is kneeling over this pile of food, gorging itself on the rotted food. It's stretched overly long, moaning as it consumes. Trying to leave, a small creature, two legged mass of flesh with sharp teeth gets stepped on by [[Rez]] and squeaks. Fuck. 

Weird to find the [[Hungry]] and the [[Wretched]] here and not on [[The Shadowfell]]. We remember [[Rez]] got her [[Shadowfell Shard]] in the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]]. We wonder if it has to do with [[The Raven Queen]] being from that plane or some other tie-in. 

We don't find anything notable in the room. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] doubles back towards the footpath to descend into the base layer of the [[Zhakastin Expedition]].
