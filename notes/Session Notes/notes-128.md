# Detailed Notes: Session 128

Everyone in the room attacks. 

One of them doesn't want the collar made inert, and as it dies 65ft of chain pulls from it, it dying as it hits the ground.

We kill them, then [[Hugh|Finn]] wants to free the warforged, and tries to dispel the collar welded to the lead one while he's dead. It works, and detaches from his neck. He then casts revivify to try and bring him back, saying he deserves a chance at freedom and life outside these walls. [[Costi]] tries to mend the metal back together. 

[[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] look at the chains try to determine which is the 47th, but realize they can count by the holes in the ceiling. [[Freya]] hacks at it until it snaps, pulled in both directions both above and below. As soon as it's done, she complains to [[The Curator]] saying "we'll have a lot of things to talk about, because you said this was something I could do on my own but I clearly cannot" - then asks if they're there. When they don't respond, they ask again, and still get no response. Maybe they're really not there? 

Miraculously, the revivify works. As soon as it sees the broken halves of the collars, is filled with hate and lashes out to hit [[Hugh|Finn]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] holds him, [[Rez]] gears up to try to modify his memory again, and [[Costi]] breaks his hand knocking him out. It works! 

We say we came down, told him the password, but right after demons/devils (we're not sure) appeared and attacked, saying they'd know why. They fought and killed everyone, broke the chain, rendered his collar, and did everything else bad. 

[[Costi]] "he put it on, only he can take it off", [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] "and where is he now?", he responds, "Probably [[Eberron City]]". He says he needs to get a message, no one can see what happens here. Asks [[Hugh|Finn]] how long he's been in operation, he says he's been here for about 130 years. He'll just use the sending stone to [[Sven]], but before he can - [[Freya]] kills him. 

[[Costi]] identifies the collar that is not dispelled from the second warforged's body. It's magical, cannot be removed, and is a status symbol of one of the guardians of [[Orzudan]]. He tries to look at one of the chains, they're a [[Chain of Orzudan]]. We debate: we don’t know which might free [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]], but it might risk him to do this, and it’ll effect [[Jezeten]] but who knows how.

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] "We found a way to extricate 300+ prisoners in [[Orzudan]], it needs to happen now or never. Do we nice do it?" he responds, "Note that black site please. Now's bad time. No way to cover that up. Would put entire military apparatus at highest alert. Advise against"

There are 368, 47 has been cut by [[Freya]]. 
* [[Finn]] - 222 
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] - 37 (above 20)
* [[Rez]] - 135, 136, 137 (above 20, but cut 3, so maybe that doesn't matter?)

We get about 500 yards away and short rest.
