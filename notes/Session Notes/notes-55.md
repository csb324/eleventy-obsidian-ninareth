# Detailed Notes: Session 55

For recap, see also:

[[Freya]] begins the day by channeling the gruung and jumping startling distances while we walk towards [[Arkhosia (City)]]. As we walk, we find a recent [[Wayfinders]] code reading: stay off the road.  We decide to move around the road with the carriage, [[Hugh]] steering, [[Giary]] carrying part of the carriages weight, and [[Samuel]] scouting above. Ahead of us, a number of bandits are laying in wait to jump travellers on the road. 

We discuss the ultimate plan, with some light morality chats, and decide to prank them with a taste of their own medicine - by finding their camp, stealing all of their stuff, and teaching them a lesson. [[Hugh]] strongly objects, and we discuss what it means to be good and if we're obligated to help. This goes from distracting them, to tricking them, paying them to stop?, or asking them nicely and then injuring them so badly they're no longer bandits. 

[[Hugh]] sendings to [[Kwurva]] to warn them. We decide to go check out the camp to get a sense of who they are and if there's incriminating evidence. [[Rez]] challenges [[Costi]] to sneak with his eyes closed, which he does, but it doesn't go well for him.

Ahead is a camp, with no fires lit and one guard on watch. [[Samuel]] flies over and sees something around a dozen tents, but they could sleep multiple. There are lots of boxes and what seems to be 4-6 people on watch. [[Costi]] uses his magic to take a closer look at the camp, we don't see any uniforms or insignia but the guards look healthy and well-outfitted. 

We decide [[Rez]] and [[Freya]] are going to try and charm them by pretending to be dumb travelers that want to trade. [[Giary]], [[Jade]], and [[Costi]] are going to wait in reserve and come join. [[Hugh]] is going to stay and guard [[Adrienne]]'s harp. 

[[Rez]] charms the first guard and pretends to be lost, asks if they want to trade, flashing some gems. The guard thinks he's spotted a target, and goes to get some friends. [[Freya]] spots that they are all well-armored and well-armed. Female guard with short cropped hair named Kaibal, seems to be one of the higher ups. [[Rez]]'s magic works really well, and charms most of them. The leader though, is not impressed and starts to draw his weapon -- triggering the rest of the party. [[Jade]] is frankly terrifying, [[Freya]] rages, and we all attack. [[Costi]] charms the big guy, and [[Rez]] tells everyone else they can get a chance to hold the topaz if they tie their hands together so they don't drop it. 

The Second's name, well who could possibly know, his brother's name is Larik. We heal him enough to give us information, and try to initimidate the rest of them into confessing things. His name is Trent, he says most of his buddies are up on the road. We try to get info on how violent they are, if they do a lot of killing, and if any of them were pressed into service. None seem innocent. We are at a bit of an impasse, [[Jade]] goes to talk to [[Hugh]].  She accidentally humanizes the bandits a bit, then backtracks by overly humanizing the egg merchant they killed. He was very charming, he had fathers, he had sheos.

[[Hugh]] understood *perfectly*.

And by that, we mean we're all at a impasse and don't know how to stop them while honoring [[Hugh]]'s adamant stance that none of them are harmed. We decide majority rules, and that the closest thing to right we have is to kill them all. There's a bit of a snafu as we do, with [[Jade]] trying to be the "good cop" while [[Freya]] threatens death, so we finally kill him off too.

We search that camp, [[Giary]] and [[Jade]] find 814GP, 1,112 SP, and 86 PP plus two healing potions and a gorgeous longbow with 30 emerald arrows. [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] we find a fancy tent, with a fancy ledger written in cipher and a package of extremely good smelling food and a key with a skull on the end. Following the magical trail, we find a backpack with three scrolls. Inside is also a magical deck of cards with a small peice of paper attached to it that reads "For Isabelle". We also find a one inch by one inch magic cube, [[Freya]] takes the plate mail from the second. 

[[Costi]] still worries we should attack the rest of the group, and after some additional arguging [[Freya]] offers to have the [[Wayfinders]] come back to take care of it once we get to [[Arkhosia (City)]]. 

We continue on the road, [[Hugh]] identifies all the items and [[Costi]] looks through the scrolls. Eventually, about a day outside of [[Arkhosia (City)]], we enter a small hamlet. An older human, with silver hair and a scratch down his arm, named [[Vorhmen]], stopped [[Freya]] asking if she's a [[Wayfinders]]. He's heard noises on his farm, and found a small creature with many legs and arms, a head on shoulders, and knives. He's asking if we can help, since all the soliders that normally patrol have been recalled to the city. Said the a neighbor named [[Kent Lander]] likes to go into the cave, he's a adult now (we think?) but [[Vorhmen]] says he's been looking for a new entrance into some of the minds. 

We ask some questions, and he's going to show us the body. About 4 foot long, with a deep wound across it's chest and one it's in temple. It's decaying rapidly, had 4 arms covered in hard stiff bristles and a large thick mane of spiky black hair. It's drooling green and has two columns of three eyes and sharp pointy teeth, it's hards all have claws and two batlike feet. 

We agree to go explore and help tonight, but we want to talk to the [[Kent Lander]] first. We discuss payment with [[Vorhmen]], he'll pay us 50 if we stop it but can't identify what's causing it, but will add 75gp if we can stop the source, and he'll provide funding for any serious harm that comes to us. Wants anything clearly stolen from the nearby homes but we can keep everything else. 

[[Costi]] asks about his involvement with the [[Arkhosian Elections]] and he seems kinda apathetic and that other people will come and collect his ballot.
