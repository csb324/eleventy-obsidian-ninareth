# Detailed Notes: Session 83

We go in the morning to meet the [[The Silver Halves]], but first [[Rez]] asks for help coming up with a prank for him. We create an elaborate bit with finding his illegitimate child, and then [[Freya]] punching him as the "punch line". 

Once we arrive, we see their airship, all black with a large red "S" on the side. [[The Silver Halves]] come out, [[Magister]] totally missing the point of [[Vask]] trying to pretend he's dead dragging a large casket. [[Rez]] says he might wish he was dead, showing the baby. [[Freya]]'s punch line hits and he wheezes "good one". As he asks her to help carry the casket, a mummy pops out and hits her twice, then [[Freya]] caves in it's skull. [[Freya]] puts the casket and dead mummy in [[my hole]].

We decide to leave tomorrow, head to [[Jalantar]] for a day or two on [[The Silver Halves]] business, then we'll all head to [[Quaath]]. The journey there from [[Jalantar]] will take around two days. They've got some work to do in town, and say we'll catch up on the ship. [[Vask]] has some cool new guns. [[Victoria Several]] says she's got a place here, like in most of the [[Southern Cities]]. 

[[Hugh]] goes to the [[Temple of the Setting Sun]] to his new acolytes, [[Tulbar]] being tapped as the dwarf who will lead the Hearth while [[Hugh]] is out of town. He seems the most dedicated of the new followers.  

[[Freya]] goes to the [[Wayfinders]], invites [[Hildehinn]] who shares that [[Naya]] is back. [[Freya]] invites her to our party. [[Naya]] offers to help improve her reputation within the [[Wayfinders]]. [[Freya]] gives an update on what she did over our winter break. She shares some of the general activities she got up too, and the fact that she was restless. She in particular is interested in any reading [[Freya]] got up too, she mentions [[Kith and Kin]]. [[Naya]] hints there's a lot there, and a lot to do once the information from it is gleaned. [[Freya]] asks for help, [[Naya]] deflects on the importance of learning it on their own. [[Freya]] mentions the hidden list she found in the [[Wayfinders]] library, and gives it to her. She notes that it was important to "some of us" that "certain outposts" be run "effectively". [[Naya]] relents that she's run into [[Akros]] a few times over the last few months, but won't say more. She says she looks for to sharing more information soon, and hearing her thoughts on [[Kith and Kin]]. [[Naya]] also flags the importance that [[Freya]] attend the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]], in [[Thelran Asari]] in Rolabloti in Sikskear on the 22nd. Most [[Wayfinders]] and every overseer will attend, [[Naya]] says there are people she'd like [[Freya]] to meet and confirms that she can bring friends. She pushes again, for [[Freya]] to have some thoughts on [[Kith and Kin]] by then, and that [[Rawley]] will be there. 

[[Jade]] and [[Rez]] scheme to throw a goodbye party tonight. We decide to invite basically everyone we know, and accidentally give everyone wildly different expectations. They run to get supplies, and ask about [[Puzzler's]] to cater. We pay them 300 gold and they'll use [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] on their branding. And they're bringing puzzles too. It's a very strange mix of people, with an up and coming band provided by [[Jenson Davour]]. We all are peak on our bullshit to make the party one to remember. We throw an incredible, weird, very us party. 

[[Henrik]] offers help with our efforts to [[Resurrect Adrienne]] and [[Costi]] says we'll keep them informed. He also offers help on our next coup, [[Costi]] asks about the Burbanks. Says [[Cliff Burbank]] doesn't travel much, and he didn't get a lot of opportunities to get to know him, but he doesn't trust anyone who's friends with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. He's surprisingly loose-lipped for an [[Eberron]], that they have more information on [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] than anyone else, and says we should not kill him. [[Sienna Burbank]] is very kind, but is also a long-time [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] associate. He reminds [[Costi]] that [[The Circle]] is still a part time job, and he still technically works for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. He says some invites will be coming soon, we should attend. [[Costi]] asks if he'll be warned before [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] ruins his life -- and [[Henrik]] says maybe. He cares more about [[Arkhosia]] than us. 

Before bed [[Freya]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]] to tell [[Akros]] she'll be there soon, and he says to come visit when we arrive. 

The next day we say goodbye (some more sentimentally than others) to our mounts, and then board the [[The Silver Halves]]' airship and head to [[Jalantar]]. It's smaller than we expected inside. Well decorated and minimalist, with lots of deep rich colors. We encounter [[Vask]], he says their job went well but was boring. He's picking up reading, currently on [[Bobo's Big Adventure]] which [[Hugh]] excitedly says he's also read. 

[[Costi]] asks [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] what they're carrying, and she says inventory for their store in [[Quaath]]. [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] ahs to get to her parents, who we're not allowed to meet, except [[Vask]] who already has. Dumb. We say we'll have a sit down catch-up on the way to [[Quaath]]. [[Hugh]] shadows [[Magister]] as he helps run the airship. 

We dock in [[Jalantar]] late that night, and get a day in the city. [[Jade]] goes to the [[The Gilded Instrument]] to search for any notes [[Zephyra]] might've left while repairing [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s [[Harp]]. She says there was nothing notable about it, other than it being old a beautiful. They repaired it as best they could to it's original condition. [[Jade]] interrgoates [[Raven]], it's odd and ultimately, uneventful. 

[[Costi]] goes and clairvoyance's the [[The Furnace]], but it's completely empty. 

[[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] go to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]], [[Hugh]] to the [[Shrine to Moradin]] and [[Rez]] to talk to [[Divitston Goldstone]]. He pulls out some of the [[Mithril Alloy]] that was grafted onto the blue dragon wyrmling that died in terrible pain. [[Divitston Goldstone]] isn't totally sure what it is, it has mithril in it, but it isn't made of it - it's mixed with something else he can't identify. He gives a section to [[Rez]]. She also asks him what he knows about [[refined firestone]], he says it makes people better at everything. He says he'll say if he knows of anyone with large amounts of it. He has a friend in [[Brask]]. He also presents [[Rez]] with a box. Inside is a necklace of copper scales.

[[Father Thronestone]] found some people selling scales, he had guards looking out for them, and confiscated it. As soon as [[Rez]] puts it on, she feels a burning heat for a moment, before relaxing - it seems like they've adhered into my neck. She attunes to the [[Scales of Chaos]].

[[Hugh]] makes it up, and [[Divitston Goldstone]] says a stranger came by who knew [[Hugh]] and gave him an a [[TrueSilver strand]] with a note "A true believer deserves true silver. I always knew you wouldn't burn, you know. Keep this safe I think you'll need it soon". No one wrote down a better description, just a dwarf traveler. He didn't want to investigate without [[Hugh]]'s permission, but will take the day to tinker with it. After some experimentation, it didn't respond to heat at all, which is uncommon, it doesn't seem wrought but bends with the flexibility of chain. He's never seen anything like it. [[Hugh]] ties it to his holy symbol

[[Hugh]] returns down to the Hearth. [[Noralin Brickview]] and [[Hernolig Alebringer]] happily greet him, and give him updates. The harp music plays periodically now, mostly on every Day of Songs. 

[[Costi]] goes to [[Redscale]], and leaves a message for [[Professor Vendorsmere]] - saying he thinks he's improved with his sword and would like to meet. Unfortunately, he's busy but wants to meet next time we're in town. 

Then he goes to see [[Qik]]. He gets quizzed by [[Innis]] who eventually decides to let him stay. [[Costi]] shares some of our adventures with her while he waits. As he talks, he feels a knife against his neck, as [[Qik]] joins him. They catch up, and she's decidedly still flirty. She updates him on her development of knife skills. [[Costi]] asks her to early dinner, and she says they could go now... or stay. He stays. ;) 

[[Freya]] fgets a workout then goes to [[Jalantar Wayfinders Outpost]] to speak with [[Akros]], who immediately congratulates her. She asks about his travels, he says it's all the same as normal, just routine work. [[Akros]] is a big fan of [[Naya]], and explains how he knows her. They dated briefly, when he seems uncomfy [[Freya]] delves into her backstory. Turns out he's been arrested 3 times, which makes her feel better. [[Akros]], [[Rawley]], and [[Naya]] all traveled together for a long time, known each other for 40 years. They joined the [[Wayfinders]] around the same time. [[Rawley]] asked [[Akros]] to also encourage [[Freya]] to go to the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]]. There's seminars, maps get updated and they say it's good practice to go - and meet "other likeminded [[Wayfinders]]". She asks about leadership and if anyone is their bosses, but they are all Overseers with similar power and differing staff. She also asks about firbolgs he's met, and if they were red. [[Akros]] says they were all blue, and near [[Polaris]]. He doesn't remember anyone's name, it was 40 years ago. Like [[Naya]] she tells him she's been working on [[Kith and Kin]] and needs some help. He says [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] can help, but maybe to keep that fact from [[Rawley]]. 

[[Rez]], [[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] go to [[Corellon's Grove]]. [[Rez]] immediately can tell [[Costi]] has had a special day, and she thoroughly embarrasses him about it. They find [[Dawenys]], who will escort us down to the area. [[Costi]] tries to pop [[Samuel]] into the burial chamber, and he can't seem to enter into the area. They say goodbye. 

We all meet back at the airship. [[Rez]] immediately messages [[Jade]] so she can tease [[Costi]]. We decide that this news is the answer to the scavenger hunt [[Jade]] is orchestrating. 

Aboard the airship, [[Hugh]] cast divination to ask [[TrueSilver]] about the [[TrueSilver strand]] "who is the person who dropped this TrueSilver off and what are their intentions?" As he holds it in his hand, he looks up and sees right below where he's holding it there's a ghostly silver hand also holding it, materializing into an arm that drifts out. He sees an unfamiliar figure, an apparition of a dwarf, older, female in a heavy robe, features largely obscured. It's hard to make out features other than bright green eyes. [[Hugh]]'s fingers retract at the same time hers do, and the [[TrueSilver strand]] falls onto a gnarled root, pulsating black. As they connect, there's a pulse of light and the vision vanishes. 

[[Hugh]] explains what he saw to [[Magister]], who takes it into his study to examine it. He's never seen anything like it, and is convinced it's very powerful - he just has no idea in what way. It radiates an energy that is unfamiliar to him, and indescribable. No noticeable command word, or method of harnessing, it seems to be a strand of divine power. He also remembers a present he has for [[Hugh]]. He presents a small silver figurine, it's not intended to be but is poorly made into accidentally looking like a possum. [[Hugh]] presents it to [[Maurice]]. [[Hugh]] gives him his journal, and copies it down into his research "on the developing mind of a potentially untethered warforged".

We all sit down for dinner. They tell us about [[Quaath]], saying it has some of the finest luxury markets on [[Ninarith]]. He again warns us to stick to the gold, it's where we'll be landing. [[Rez]] also mentions trying to go to the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]]. He says there's some worth visiting in Silver, and Copper is mostly rough bars and fighting. 

We ask what they were last working on, and with [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]'s permission [[Magister]] shares they were looking into how different kinds of magic work. They were in [[Eberron]] and then the [[Turian Waste]], but didn't go to [[Deregheir]]. [[Rez]] says her brother lives there, [[Ali]]. They raided a pyramid for a tablet for [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]. It's not about dunamancy, but the magic of blood (a distinction from blood magic). It's about self-blood use rather than others. This reminds [[Freya]] internally to check if [[The Curator]] has used her blood.

[[Hugh]] asks about [[Eberron]]. [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] says she picked up a few items for [[Several's Antiquities]]. We try to pry but she says her mom, [[Senres Several]] , would kill her for sharing secrets outside of an appointment. We share we might be traveling to [[Eberron]] next to stay at the [[Burbank Compound]]. [[Magister]] asks [[Hugh]] let them know before we go, but says [[Cliff Burbank]] should know about warforged more than anywhere else. 

We ask if he's learned anything more about the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]] or the [[Magically Resistant Chain]]. We share what we found in the [[Duvey Crypt|Duvey Crypt]] . [[Jade]] worries about the [[The Silver Hand]] in [[Hugh]]'s [[TrueSilver]] vision, and we ask the [[The Silver Halves]]. Looking at [[Hugh]]'s note, but [[Magister]] recognizes it's written in thieves cant. He has a discreet contact who can look at it further in [[Quaath]]. [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] knew her from [[Quaath]], and said she was a bitch then went missing 4 years ago. The [[Duvey Family]] are a competing family to [[Several's Antiquities]], and they show us their family symbol - a very flowery D. They are a merchant family, selling home goods, but leaned toward the adventuring type. [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] says both their families have those with adventuring streaks. If we want to visit their store we just need to make an appointment, they don't really have stores - you just make adjustments.

They recommend an inn for us [[Quaath]], it'll be expensive. We also get some jewelry store recommendations. [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] will sponsor us at immigration, and asks we don't do crimes and make her regret it. She requests we keep a low profile, don't intentionally draw attention. She'll set up meetings for us. She tells us not to trust [[Baldred Duvey]], which we agree with. ([[Magister]] tells us they were involved). He was cousin to [[Winifey]], and says [[Albus Duvey]] is kooky. He's run some of the [[Duvey Family]] into the ground, he's a gambling addict. [[Carlot Duvey]] is an elderly woman who hasn't lost a step, her husband is dead, her kids are . She's a cousin to [[Albus Duvey]] who kid is [[Kestin Duvey]]

[[Freya]] ends up dancing around [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] symbols. She asks if skin is traceable magically. It devolves into us sharing there's a symbol on it. She finally fesses up and shows [[Winifey|Winnie]]'s skin. [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] uses some of her magic to investigate it. We don't notice any immediate reactions on her or [[Magister]]'s face when they initially examine it. [[Magister]] can't quite remember where he's seen it, but it rings a bell. We say it was also on the back of the [[Vecna]] [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]] from the [[Halls of the Dead]]. They'll try to learn more about it for us.

They say [[Quaath]] is "interestingly racist" since the creation of Devios - they don't like green complexions, or either of their neighbors. There's always many hobgoblins and orc refugees, which adds strain. For warforged it is relatively safe. They don't love [[Eberron]] but there's enough distance to soften that strain. They don't believe there's a temple of [[Moradin]] there. It's mostly outside the city for those other than [[Bahamut]]. 

[[Rez]] asks if they can identify the [[Mithril Alloy]] from [[Divitston Goldstone]] - [[Magister]] eats a small peice and says - 7% mithril 58% steel 12% aluminum there's a small amount of lead and mercury, and a "distilled essence of weave". It is rare but not unheard of - it's pure magic that is a byproduct of creation, found on other planes in remote locations. [[Rez]] says it was grafted onto a blue dragon and killed it, [[Magister]] says it's not surprising.

[[Vask]] says he almost started a war in the [[Turian Waste]], by pissing off a blue dragon that came to levy a tax and shooting it's rider. [[Magister]] paid it off. He wanted to start a war just to end it, he doesn't want to let [[Rez]] get all the glory. 

Before bed [[Freya]] reaches out to [[The Curator]] on if the timeline for her blood is up and if it was used. She doesn't respond. 

[[Rez]] puts sorcery point into her [[Scales of Chaos]].
