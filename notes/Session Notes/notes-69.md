# Detailed Notes: Session 69 (nice)

As we settle, we see that the hole in the floor looks relatively recently cut. The gang investigates: [[Jade]] learns it's not shallow but can't tell how deep it goes, [[Costi]] doesn't know off hand what cut the hole but is confident if he saw the tool he'd recognize it. Perhaps a large number of pickaxes, but clearly a tool. There's also a ladder cut into it. It's also clear there was formerly a sarcophagus here, but the hole can't be older than 3 months old. 

[[Jade]] looks where the orb had been, and there's a small indention but does not seem like it's been any longer here than the hole. [[Rez]] and [[Costi]] investigate the shards of the orb from [[Freya]] for any signs of it's former magic. [[Costi]]'s detect magic doesn't find anything else in the room, but the two of them notice that when the detect magic passed over it reacted somehow: brief flashes of illumination or perhaps a moving shape? We split the pieces for safekeeping, one staying with [[Freya]] and [[Rez]] calling dibs on the other half. 

[[Freya]] scouts to see if there's somewhere safe to rest, and reports back that the statue snakes still seem suspicious and terrorital. [[Jade]] thinks she can go talk to them, while [[Hugh]] counsels her that they are not real snakes. They are in fact not. [[Jade]] is quickly attacked.  It looks back for a second but we get it taken care of, and then find a safe place to rest up. 

We heal and discuss what to do, and decide to do the [[Death Halls Heist]] before checking the rest of the whole or going out of our way to find the fallen [[Death's Watchers]]. [[Rez]] also warns that last time there was a deep hole underground a beholder and [[Xcanthak]] dwarves. [[Costi]] also starts to think about the speed that we went down the elevator 90-110ft from floor to floor, knowing that our target floor is probably 300 ft down, or halfway down the hole. He's a very smart boy.

As we start to head down, [[Costi]] rights a note for [[Ravona Drakness]], that says "Defeated one evil sprirt, searching for feathers in hole."

We start to climb down, [[Costi]] giving us a small amount of light. At one point, [[Jade]] starts to slip down and [[Rez]] catches her. The rest of us make our way down without too much trouble. [[Freya]] notices that it occasionally gets thinner at regular intervals, where we think each floor might be. We reach where we think the 36th floor would be. [[Costi]] pops [[Samuel]] on the other side of the wall, and we learn he (unlike normal ravens) has darkvision. 

However the room on the other side is a lit room with a few dusty tables and two doors, one plain and one extremely ornate with a SE. [[Samuel]] loops to see any other details, but only really notices some strangely preserved fruit. [[Rez]] talks about trying to make the tool [[Costi]] determined shaped the hole earlier to try and keep our cover story, and we decide to try to break through and then clean it up later. [[Freya]] starts to punch through the wall, and then realized her pickaxe might be a better option anyway. As she beats onto the wall, [[Hugh]] magically tries to cover the sound. 

She breaks through the wall, a brief flash of darkness bursts out and washes over us. We are all drained by necrotic energy, and [[Freya]] fights being frozen by this energy and she holds onto the wall. She carries most of us over, and [[Hugh]] uses the [[Blow Em]] to fly himself over. 

Inside we find a dining hall with 5 long tables that have about 10 seats at each, all having a full plate and drinks. The walls are decorated with art and 13 tapestries, with the simple door on our left and the intricate door on our right. [[Costi]] detects magic and sees that the food is enchanted. In the center of the door, there are three switches all at a neutral setting, above them it says "Rememberances" and below each switch more writing, 1: "Three days on the Tivian", 2: "A palace, a painting, and pain", 3: "Two shots of Lendith, and a sharp knife".

At the head of the table, nearest the door, there are two very small glasses that are full of something, and a very fine large golden knife. It has a small inscription that says, "to my love with love". There's a tapestry that shows a mountain range to the north, trees on the right, plain on the left, and a boat going southward on rapids in river with a horrible storm over head, it's clearly showing turmoil. At the very bottom right hand corner where a signature might be reads "I.M.Sorry". [[Jade]] goes to check out the plain door, and when [[Costi]] pops [[Samuel]] on the other side we see a similar elevator reception room. The walls are decorated to look like a verdant garden. We decide we need to find the second clue, and [[Rez]] looks more closely at the filigree, and sees in the base level of the art that looks like a romanticized version of the [[Irvenhold]] in [[Taleem]]. We debate what the switches signify, and decide to see if there's a remembrance of [[Sheske Eeping]] at the tapestry, and if all of these should be chosen if they're remembrance.

The vibes open the door. And we're immediately jumped by an umberhulk and 6 animated weapons. We fight and it's HARD, at one point [[Costi]]'s sword is drawn to the weapon that killed [[Samuel]]. After we clear everything else on the map, [[Costi]] goes mano-e-mano with this fucking dagger and we all stand back to watch. It's a little painful to watch but he ultimately is victorious - and after the slaughter he feels his sword lighten even further with an almost feathery flash of black feathers up the blade. For a fraction of a second, the metal turns green, and he feels a pulsing energy that he hasn't felt before - it calls to him. The sword has an idea of itself [[Potential]], that is now +1 weapon. 

[[Jade]] watches as this happens, and her glasses flash gray ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]). She notices the color change, but sees it as two hues: a deep crimson and a royal purple, before flashing away. She pulls a notecard from her bag and gets [[Cinder]].

In the corner of the room, we see the large decorative mirror. [[Jade]], [[Rez]], and [[Costi]] go to look at it while [[Hugh]] and [[Freya]] cut up the Umberhulk. We decide to put it into [[my hole]] and have [[Hugh]] identify it tomorrow. [[Costi]] finds a box that has a small mirror in it, it carries neutral magical vibes, it carries some sense of illusion magic. He stares at himself in it. Won't be any issues here. [[Rez]] asks [[Jade]] for help searching for diamonds, and they find a diamond tennis bracelet with 14 stones, [[Rez]] thinks it's worth at least 1,000 GP. [[Costi]] and [[Freya]] lighten some of the sacks, [[Freya]] gets 20pp, [[Costi]] gets 15gp and 10pp, [[Jade]] takes 150gp.

Meanwhile [[Hugh]] lights a candle and thanks [[Sheske Eeping]], telling her we're only taking the things we need.
