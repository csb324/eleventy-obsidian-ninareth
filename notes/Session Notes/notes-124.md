# Detailed Notes: Session 124

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] to [[Eva Sidorev|Eva]]s address. 

We confront [[Hugh|Finn]] about his unexpected decision to rejoin the [[Eberronian Military]]. It leads into a whole winding road of a conversation. [[Hugh|Finn]] says he wants to find a partner, which when [[Rez]] questions how he could love a mortal, we spin off onto whether or not [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] plans to stay together indefinitely ([[Freya]] was the only one with this impression), how likely each of us are to die, and then if biologics ([[Costi]] prefers over [[Rez]]'s suggestion of mortals) should not do warforged drugs.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] goes to talk to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] about what else will be asked of us in [[Jezeten]]. She suggests we'll spend some time there before anything happens, so we should build a name for ourselves first. We'll be introduced to [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] when we arrive, but we should keep our cool when [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]] is there (oh yay, he's promoted). They say to keep [[ELA Ebony Stake]] in lead and hidden on us. 

After a few weeks there should be an "inciting event" with the hope our reputation (bolstered by what ever we can do there) will make us a natural fit to intervene, but our track record can give us cover if we 'fail'. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks for as much info as possible on [[Von]], who is one of at least 20 of [[Duke v'Bihor]]'s bastards. They have reason to believe [[Von]] is undead, not confirmed what kind but assuming vampiric. He operates similarly to [[Trisha]], is likely the chief of [[Duke v'Bihor]]'s information network but largely off the books due to his illegitimate nature. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] would be surprised if he didn't know [[Colvia Ghul]] but doesn't have reason to think they'd be close. However, if there's anyone who could have an information network that rivals the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] it would be [[Colvia Ghul]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks for her to keep her ear out for any news.

On the way to the [[Made Fors]] camp, [[Freya]] quizzes [[Hugh|Finn]] on potential partners of interest, listing off people the other members of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] have slept with. [[Freya]] has made a bunch of friends. [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] discuss the bracers from a previous warforged - he shared that it is normal to honor fallen warforged within the [[Made Fors]] by passing along pieces of themselves. These bracers could be incorporated into his battle form. [[Hugh|Finn]] struggles some with the concept, prompting [[Ligo]] to mention how much of himself he's forgotten. But [[Hugh|Finn]] accepts, and spends the day being augmented.

[[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] and [[Freya]] train, and afterwards, he thanks her for killing [[Lukan]] and asks when she eventually kills [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]] to also make it last. He warns his range is longer than you'd think, longer than even [[Freya]]'s, but he's slow and stiff. His axe is particularly dangerous. He also shares the [[Made Fors]] will be nearby when we're in [[Jezeten]].

We get ready for the party, [[Costi]] in his new formal uniform, [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Freya]] in their regular garb, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] in a light version of her armor, and [[Rez]] is a flirty atrocity made from [[Costi]]'s stolen uniform top and one of the berets, traumatizing [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] just a little bit for fun in the process.

We arrive at [[Fingers]]' party - it's the social event of the decade in the [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]]. There's a line, but we're escorted inside. We're kids at the carnival, with art projects, bands, a merch table, and a maze, which PLEASE don't fuck in. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] plays along for fun, gets split up and find our way out in the most stereotypical versions of our own actions possible. We find [[Marigold]], and help her escape too.
