# Detailed Notes: Session 117

As we notice a portal open in the tree, two polar bears and three firbolgs step through - one [[Freya]] recognizes as [[Petra]] says, "it's been a long time, bitch!" 

They make it clear they want to take [[Freya]] but kill the rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. [[Petra]] uses a dagger that collects a vial of [[Freya]]'s blood. When we're turning the corner on the combat, a portal opens up again and pulls an incapacitated [[Petra]] through, killing [[Jhanni]] at the same time. We tie up one of the polar bears to try and interrogate it. 

We look through the corpses and take a superior healing potion. [[Hugh|Finn]] takes the not-captive bear's pelt and teeth. 

Right at the same time that [[Freya]] heals the captive bear, [[Costi]] turns it brain into a cub's, while [[Freya]] casts speak with animals. It goes a little sketchy a first, but she starts to win him over. He ends up being dubbed [[Buddy the Bear]]. Trying to show him it's okay, [[Costi]] turns into a bear too. Together, they try to tell him he was abandoned and his best chance at a new life is here. Turns out [[Buddy the Bear]] recognizes [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] and thinks maybe it was [[Balsandor]], a few times. There's also been a few times that he saw non-firbolgs. A few humanoids, human sized and a few even bigger. [[Costi]] radicalizes him, and eventually we part was for him to make his way back north. 

We take a quick walk and find somewhere to catch our breath. [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] tries to get as much information out of [[Freya]] as she can. She gives small amounts, sharing parts of the bears conversation, and saying she doesn't fully know why she was kicked out from [[Polaris]]. Despite our healing, [[Freya]]'s knife wound from [[Petra]] doesn't seem to be closing. Suddenly, she remembers that she also stole some of her blood. [[Blood Magic]] again.

It turns into conversations about love lives, then [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] warns [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] about [[Fingers]] - a lot of her exes go missing, get reassigned, or worse. We then ask her opinion about [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], she says he's soft but runs a tight ship; she appreciates that he doesn't lean into cruelty for cruelty's sake. [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] was training to be part of [[Teld's Dogs]] due to her excellent tracking ability but failed the 'final test' - she couldn't stomach it. She ended up with [[Colvia Ghul]] about a year and a half ago, though she was a follower of [[Ioun]] before that. She hopes to serve with her wherever she goes.

She asks about [[Kith and Kin]] but we pretend not to be able to find.
