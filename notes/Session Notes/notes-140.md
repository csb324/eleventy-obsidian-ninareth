# Detailed Notes: Session 140

We wake the next morning with [[Bek]] providing us a map of the [[Zhakastin Expedition]]. He flags that the attack, and the resulting damage, might've changed the layout in ways he's not aware of.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] talks briefly about our goals, deciding to try and sneak in as far as we can to investigate rather than fighting every undead we come across. 

[[Bek]] tells us the rift to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] is in the 3rd floor, in the mining chamber of sapphire. 

As [[Costi]] preps his spells, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tells [[Rez]] that [[Driega Jolentia]] was the jewelers [[Starstool Daygrip]] used in [[Durmask]].

We, quite poorly, attempt to approach the cave stealthily. As we near the entrance, [[Hugh|Finn]] spots skeleton creatures man the top triggers a trap.

Unfortunately, [[Freya]] seems to be influenced by the [[Ring of the Undead Masses]] into not wanting to harm undead. This curse is very bad. We struggle in a frankly embarrassing way, but eventually overcome them without using TOO many resources. 

As we kill the rogue undead, it says "good job, I'll see you real soon". 

Once the fight ends, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] pulls [[Freya]] aside and says [[Hugh|Finn]] needs to cast a spell on her. He jokes that maybe he should just cut her finger off, but relents and casts remove curse. He then confiscates the [[Ring of the Undead Masses]].

[[Bek]] says all the draconic seem to be new. He said of the voices he heard, one was high, one quite low, and the other was fancy and seemed to reference "my lord".

We pull back to find a place to try and take a brief respite. [[Bek]] says the lead draconic undead must have just recently gained the ability to meld into stone. We try and consider if we should postpone, and what the odds are they'll have the same defenses each day. 

[[Costi]] casts an arcane eye for us to try and scout out the path forward inside [[Zhakastin Expedition]].
