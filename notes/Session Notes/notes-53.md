# Detailed Notes: Session 53

For recap, see also:

We wake up and discuss [[Freya]]'s book [[Kith and Kin]] more and also plans to get more diamonds. [[Jade]] suggests looking more into the diamond dusk cream. [[Rez]] agrees. We talk more about we want to do in [[Arkhosia (City)]]: [[Hugh]] visited the temple, [[Freya]] get her transcontinental [[Wayfinders]] tattoo, [[Costi]] buy spell scrolls, [[Rez]] visit OOTPD, earn some group money, and look into the diamond cream, figure out [[Fire Raisers]], [[Freya]] look into the book from [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], 

As we round up to a rocky outcropping, a wild wyvern appears! Two in fact, and one with a green scaled creature riding it. Several more lizardfolk come out from the rocks. We fight, [[Costi]] turns [[Samuel]] into an ape, which may or may not have repercussions. When the spell is finally dropped, we all see [[Samuel]] shake and disappears -- [[Costi]] can't bring him back, the page in his spell book is mysteriouly blank...

[[Jade]] interrogates the spectre she made of one of the dead lizardfolk, but he doesn't have much brains either before or after life so he's not very helpful. [[Hugh]] and [[Freya]] carve up the wyverns, [[Costi]] looks through the dead lizardfolks stuff. We find some nice scalemail and and a sword of [[Pelor]], which when [[Costi]] tries to detect magic finds he can no longer cast that either. We discuss what might be happening to him, and if [[Samuel]] was unhappy or affected by the polymorph.

On the road we talk a bit further about [[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]], and she says we should keep an eye on [[Relakas]] and also [[Josh|Jinx]]. She doesn't know what it means 

[[Rez]] sends to [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] - "Hi Professor it's Rez! Can we pay for like a BUNCH of diamonds? Like, literally as many as is possible? very important - for a spell."" He replies: "Sure! How much money do you have? I realize that's not a convenient way to convey this message as you cannot respond immediately, but the answer is yes it just depends on your ability to -"

[[Hugh]] sending to [[Costi's mom]] about our [[ELA]] contact, she says to chat with [[Pruvki Forgaveat]], but not sure where he is. He's her friend though. This spins us off again on what to do about the [[Fire Raisers]] and our goals. We want to stop the death of innocents, help contain [[Niko]], and try to prevent the [[Fire Raisers]] from doing this again. We're still stuck on the how. We scrounge our memories for clues, and remain uncertain on our take. We think [[Niko]] and [[Cinder]] are happy for the violence but don't know if that applies to [[Winifey]] too. [[Freya]] asks [[Costi]] what is his perspective on [[Niko]] now, and he says while [[Niko]] wants is good he's more sympathetic to [[Giary]]'s point of view. We chat for a while longer.

[[Costi]] pulls away from the group to try and talk to [[Samuel]] and figure out what went wrong. He tries to recreate the Find Familiar page, but can't do it. He tells him he'll keep trying, but apologizes for turning him into an ape. 

[[Freya]] reads her book, and [[Hugh]] works on preserving the wyvern stingers. [[Rez]] and [[Giary]] go off to 'try something twice'. We keep watches and as [[Costi]] starts tries to fall asleep, he struggles with a lingering emptiness. 

As he dreams, he looks down to see he's standing on a silver sheet of meteal with void all around him. In front of him, a couple shades of light flickers, green, white, red, and behind a pulsing brown light. Costi feels called to the brown, and as he takes a single step he hears large beating wings rushing at his back. Right as it would hit, he feels a large presence behind his back. A voice behind him goes, "not yet constantine, you shouldn't be here" "who are you" never do that again. A sharp raking crosses his back and he's surrounded by feathery blackness. 

[[Rez]] soothes him and talks with [[Jade]], but they decide to let him sleep. When we wake [[Costi]] tries to ask [[Samuel]] what happened and what he is, but he's not helpful. [[Costi]] asks us not to wake him in the future, that dreaming is very important to a diviniation wizard. We set back out on the road.
