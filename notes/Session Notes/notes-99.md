# Detailed Notes: Session 99

We decide to kill a few hours in our office at the [[Ratoucha]]. [[Lara Frozenwatcher]] brings us updated information about [[Building 17]] on our map of [[Viliki]]. According to the information we gave, there's two streets it could likely be: [[Krintuk Street]] is on the northern end of town and [[Avrondale Street]] more towards the western-center. 

We arrive at the [[Founding Flagon]], and it's crowded even at this early hour. Belatedly, we realize both [[Hugh]] and [[Costi]] are wearing tophats. It's painful, and [[Costi]] REALLY tries to pull it off. He does not succeed. 

[[Marina Alduchev]], however, tells him he looks like a war hero and [[Costi]] is converted entirely to the tophat. We tell her she should visit [[Pooka]], and get talking about how undead can keep their personality - then get distracted talking about how hot [[Tallshard]] is. She mentions meeting him in the caves down by the [[Viliki Fisheries]]. Wonder if they connect to the caves we met him in at the [[Viliki Boneyard]].

[[Marina Alduchev]] tells us she can introduce us to [[Garida]], but warns us she can be a bit prickly. She brings us over to a kobold and an older looking human who smells like salt, we assume who works in the [[Viliki Fisheries]]. She's playing a version of the knife game and [[Costi]] volunteers to play with her. They simultaneously stab each other, but it seems to serve as bonding.

She tells us about the caravan attack. The were traveling from [[Mulfara]] (her companions were her 3rd cousin, and a drow woman she got close with) with some spleens, blood, ogre blood, pelvis bones, and small spiders. She says not too far from [[Viliki]], about two hours, arrows attacked and she ran away. She ran into a group of [[Eberronian Military]] soldiers who ended up being close by, they escorted her to town and a few went to look at the attack site. According to her, there were between 6 and 20 attackers but she didn't get a look at them. 

[[Garida]] offers to take us to the site, she had previously taken a group of [[Eberronian Military]], including [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]]. We decide we should go in the morning, and plan to meet up at 10 tomorrow. Instead, we start to drink. [[Freya]] shares lindeth for [[Garida]]'s poison. It ends up being pretty legit, and after declining a free drink of the second bottle, pays her 20 GP for it. 

We all end up drinking. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks [[Marina Alduchev]] what the deal is between the [[Eberronian Military]] in town and the [[Viliki Guard]]. The military believes [[Security Director Aldi]] is incompetent, he was "lax" on [[Shari's Boys]] and they have turf wars over who leads in town. The guards believe the military is cruel and overbearing. 

[[Rez]] tries to make our decision for evening plans as heads-alley / tails-[[Building 17]]. When fate decides it's the alley, [[Costi]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] intervene with "double or nothing" and cheat to make the coin show tails. Earning an extra copper, [[Rez]] decides it counts and we go to check out the two addresses. 

We disguise ourselves, and [[Rez]] goes invisible, as we make our way there. [[Avrondale Street]] does not seem familiar to [[Hugh]], but as we approach [[Krintuk Street]] it starts to feel right to him. We enter into an alley, and [[Costi]] hides in a box to cast arcane eye. [[Rez]] stays by him invisible, while the rest of the team walks through to dispel any suspicion. 

[[Costi]] sends the eye to [[Building 17]]. He has it go down the floo of the fire place and lands in the living room, the coals are alive so someone was recently here. A sword is hung on the wall near the front door, and he then send it through the door on the left up to the second floor. He takes the left in the upper hallway and enters a bedroom. It's relatively plain, but there's women's clothes in the hamper. He also notices the rug in the center of the room is askew, and there's the edge of a trap door. 

In the alley, a small figure bumps into me and says "[[Chai]] did you hear something?", from the other side of the box, another figures says "I saw someone go in here". They try to jump [[Costi]], but we scare one off and easily over power the other -- it's a young teen halfling. [[Rez]] pretends to be a ghost and it's both sad and effective. No, I don't know his dad, but yes all ghosts are smart. 

[[Halv]] agrees to answers questions if the ghost to tries and find his dad [[Karlow]] and tell him "it's okay". [[Rez]] agrees.

He's one of [[Shari's Boys]], and keeps 30% of his criminal earnings. He says he thinks [[Shari]] is made up. He gives us the house address where he goes to give his earnings, and live. He doesn't want to give up [[Chai]] because he's afraid the guards will hurt him. 

There's 17 of them in his house. He says there is an undead dog, and they get more if they find blood and bits. [[Chai]] is in charge at the house they live in. 

[[Rez]] says she may need his help to "complete her unfinished business", and we tell him to trust the group. 

We decide to give him the hand of the mummy from [[My Hole]] so we can locate it and track where it goes. We also offer to rough him up a little if it will help his cover story, and he picks [[Costi]]. Except, it's [[Costi]] - he misses and it's so deeply embarrassing the child decides he doesn't need vengeance after all. He turns around and [[Costi]] decks him in the back of the head, bloodying him. 

[[Costi]] resumes investigating the house. Sees what looks like blood on a cutting board and plate, as well as in several bottles - could be wine or blood. He finds a latch in the back of the pantry. Completing his circuit of the house, we determine no one is there and decide it's B&E time. 

Right as we're about to enter the window, [[Shay]] comes back into the house, and is ready to fight with a knife drawn as she investigates the open window. She lays two powders over the windowsill, but [[Costi]] can recognize it's not alarm. She's intense and dead-faced watching the window, until our spells start to run out and we leave. 

Back at the hotel, we recap. We decide the ghost can send to [[Halv]] if needed. [[Hugh]] learns she left suddenly, which makes us think her window is alarmed. 

[[Rez]] tries to sending to [[Karlow]], but it doesn't go through - in the way she knows means someone is no longer here.
