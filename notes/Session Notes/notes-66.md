# Detailed Notes: Session 66

As we leave, the crowd reacts to our various feats, we seem to be well-received, [[Rez]] especially. [[Rhys]] comes to congratulate us, and tells us we earned a 15% bonus, we earn 280 gp EACH. We start to rest and [[Rez]] ruminates on her role in [[Giary's Circus]] and how she's naturally a performer - everyone heals from a papercut.

As we recover, [[Dharbeed Tzaavi]] comes in to meet us and congrulate us on a great performance. He wants to know if we're intersted in a special fight - there's a group that's become a 'problem' lead by a pirate captain named [[Schrayol Vactderdin]]. They've been winning a little too much, it's been a problem for the books. He cares most that they lose, but he thinks they'll insist on fighting to the death. [[Giary]] says he's seen them fight, they're normally five but tonight there's four because the captain went back to the boat. His first mate named [[Wisk]], a big fella who gets mad and hits hard, and three other crew members including: an elven navigator who's connected to the stars, a sneaky archer, and a weapons expert. 

He agrees that if we win we can get a good bonus or a favor, AND he'll tell us the ending of the phrase "A friend of the [[Fishermen]]...". 

We ask him about his wife, and if she ever fights here - but he says no, he wouldn't let anyone he actually cared about fight. We ask about cheating, and he says he takes the rules of the place seriously, it's his livelihood. He says he joined up with the [[Fishermen]] when he was 7, worked with some crews in the [[Tropics]], he worked this place for a while and running it for the last 3 years. He says there's several dozen that fight here, "enough to keep him rich". He says he gets their monsters all over, we ask about sourcing them - the gem stalker was from the mines, they occasionally works with the miners. He likes to sit right up to watch the fight, and is generally there 5 nights a week. We should ask [[Giary]] more about him. 

About 45 minutes later, the fire beside us starts to crackle and 4 bodies step out of the flames: [[Willum]], [[Cut]], [[Terrav]], and [[Niko]]. [[Cut]] notices that [[Jade]] is a bit tweaked out, but gets a bit friendly in his purusal. As [[Jade]] looks at [[Niko]] for the first time, her glasses flash gray ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]). [[Jade]] asks if they are always surveiling, they imply often but when [[Freya]] asks if we can report into the fire they say it's not that frequent. [[Rez]] asks if they'll teach us how to walk through the fire, and [[Willum]] says he'll teach us after 'our work' wraps.

[[Willum]] gives us our next task, he says next week there's an event that they need to get into, one the 28th. It's a fundraiser for the [[Ichlior]] and [[Willen Guruden]] family, at the [[Ichlior]] estate. They say a few of them need to go to gain information. They say they'll get a few items, seems like it'll be [[Cut]] and [[Niko]] who sneak in. We try to gain information and they don't budge. He says there's a particular window at a particular time, they'll mark us the spot on a map. [[Rez]] asks about our last job and if everything went well with the [[Copper Foundry]], but they won't tell anything other than our work there is done. [[Willum]] and [[Cut]] leave.

We get a little bit of time talking to [[Niko]], we hear that he's patched things up with the [[Fire Raisers]], and we guilt him some on not seeing [[Giary]], and he says he worries about him but hasn't met with him. Asks for us not to mention that we've seen him. He says he's sorry to have missed [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s burial - [[Rez]] asks if the [[Fire Raisers]] can target [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], and [[Niko]] says he'll do what he can at the fundraiser.

[[Niko]] believes that after [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]], the [[Fire Raisers]] will be in a position to negotiate fully with the support of the people, and come out of the shadows. He says it will be a show of force, but done carefully. They've become more public, taking more credit for their work, using [[Norathar Pent]] and other bad business leaders as examples to hearts and minds. They make it clear that they're going to do so much action that won't be able to be ignored. He says with our help we can make sure it's done with only the right lives being lost. After we bring up the fire fighters have to fight creatures of fire being a bad plan (which he says [[Rhene Blackstone]] already gave them that feedback) that there ideally will be no creatures of fire at [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]]. 

[[Costi]] gets a note slipped to him that says: "Re-established trust in operation, many disappeared [[Zephyra]] included, she's fine, it was a plot. I'm closer to leadership now, will update soon" looks like it was written in [[Terrav]]'s hand. 

We are escorted to our arena, and we see [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] solo fighting a fire giant in another arena, who has taken on the moniker [[The Hunter]]. What a jerk, but a scary one. 

Our fight seems rough at first but we quickly get it into hand, notably though, once the tides have turned the druid is clearly in bad shape and [[Hugh]] makes the choice in the moment to kill her, despite recognizing where we are in the fight, kills her. It effects him deeply, the fire from [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] beside his holy symbol burns out and when [[Jade]] looks him and her glasses flash gray [[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]. Intrigued, she pulls her breifcase mid-fight to see what's going on? She pulls a card reading [[Corellon Larethian]] then [[Pelor]] then [[Moradin]].
