# Detailed Notes: Session 68

We make it back to the hotel and talk about things. [[Hugh]] tries to draw some of the faces from his vision. He draws the dragonborn and the blonde woman. [[Costi]] andreads the books to prepare for the [[Death Halls Heist]] and [[Jade]] searches the [[The Unnatural Naturality]] for information about black flames. It's a relatively common religious symbol, typically for creatures created by [[Bane]]. It is said that the first of creation was born of black flame, it's used by many devils and demons. 

[[Rez]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]] to send to [[Zephyra]], "[[Zephyra]]!! Heard you're ~undercover~. Have the [[Fire Raisers]] sorted everything?? Feels like a cover. Can you give us info? Can we trust [[Terrav]]? Or [[Niko]]? Why?". She responds, "My plan. [[Terrav]] turned me in to get back with leaders. Trust him, not others. Safe for now, can get out, preserving his cover."
