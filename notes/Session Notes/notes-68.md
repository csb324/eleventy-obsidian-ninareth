# Detailed Notes: Session 68

We make it back to the hotel and talk about things. [[Hugh]] tries to draw some of the faces from his vision. He draws the dragonborn and the blonde woman. [[Costi]] andreads the books to prepare for the [[Death Halls Heist]] and [[Jade]] searches the [[The Unnatural Naturality]] for information about black flames. It's a relatively common religious symbol, typically for creatures created by [[Bane]]. It is said that the first of creation was born of black flame, it's used by many devils and demons. 

[[Rez]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]] to send to [[Zephyra]], "[[Zephyra]]!! Heard you're ~undercover~. Have the [[Fire Raisers]] sorted everything?? Feels like a cover. Can you give us info? Can we trust [[Terrav]]? Or [[Niko]]? Why?". She responds, "My plan. [[Terrav]] turned me in to get back with leaders. Trust him, not others. Safe for now, can get out, preserving his cover."

We talk more about the Hiest, and decide we need a forgery letter but as we start a letter-off [[Jade]] fabricates one from Tompt Kerthunk that looks incredible. [[Costi]] writes one with a strong [[The Raven Queen]] vibe, with a sloping creepy handwriting. As he writes, one of [[Samuel]]'s feather welds to the page. [[Rez]] gets distracted and writes a fanfiction instead, [[Hugh]] thinks it's "interesting".

We ready ourselves, and get disguises. [[Jade]] heads out first, and [[Hugh]] gets into [[my hole]].  We enter into the [[Halls of the Dead]]. People notice us but immediately seem deferent to [[Samuel]]. We go and mock worship, [[Samuel]] on [[Costi]]'s shoulder begins to tremble and drops a feather. [[Costi]] places it on the alter, and as he pulls his hand away he feels a strange coldness that builds into static in his brain, but seems to shrug it off. The sword on his back seems to be cold as well, and he asks [[Samuel]] if he'd like to still be here. [[Costi]] picks up an air of ease within [[Samuel]], who almost seems more comfortable than he's ever been. 

A tiefling with deep maroon skin, jet-black hair, and clothing stitched with the pattern of ravens feathers welcomes him, her name is [[Ravona Drakness]]. We give her our coverstory, and she says it's a honor to have us here - she fully bows to [[Samuel]], who pecks her and seems unnaturally still and comfortable. She says she will take us below to the Queen's quarters, and says the raven feather is enough tithe. She says her family has taken care of this shrine for a long time. 

She leads us to a semi-hidden door blended into the stone, and we travel underground on stairs for approx 40 ft. She leads us into a room of bunks with 10 beds, 3 of which look recently slept in. On our walk, [[Jade]] asks if they have struggled with undead like [[Eberron]]. She says whereever great many dead gather some are restless, they try to help those with their passage who need it. [[Rez]] offers our services, and [[Costi]] convinces her that we are capable. She asks us to log our pilgramage, so they can keep track of who we graduate. We write: Arendelle Solyla, Dorinne Minurs, Wolanda, and Bridget Jones. Two of mark we are from [[Eberron]], one from [[Taleem]], and one as a refugee. [[Rez]] asks [[Samuel]] if he was acting, and he seems to have been! 

[[Costi]] re-ups his alter self as [[Ravona Drakness]] and her husband, a goblin named [[Gaarth]], enters the room. He's there to welcome us, and tries to get us to eat dinner. We go weird to try and get on the road, [[Costi]] seems a bit off-putting and he's skeptical of [[Jade]], so [[Rez]] leans in to get us moving. She tells us there's spirits who have been active below in some of the lower crypts, some of their watchers went below two weeks ago, but they didn't return. With fear of what is happening in [[Arkhosia (City)]], they can't spare more watchers. It is extremely distressing to them, to know this corruption is happening in the sacred temple. She asks for us to bring their feathers.  She'll grant us passage to go below, and if we return they'll consider our march ended. 

She leads us down another 30 ft, and through a door of a central stone maintence tunnel. We walk until we reach what looks to be the elevators. [[Ravona Drakness]] pulls out a key that ends in feathery black metal and calls the elevator. She asks if we can find the reason, they would consider it a personal favor to share it. Right as the doors close [[Freya]]'s disguise disappears but with a big show from [[Samuel]] and an illusion from [[Rez]] we hid her until the elevator door closes.

We get [[Hugh]] and discuss that we will try to kill the ghosts for them too when the elevator stops at the 33rd floor, it's carved from imported sandstone and is both ornate and beautiful. [[Wukris]] seems to be family vault we're in. There are intricate patterns along the walls and a door blocks the only way forward with magic. As [[Costi]] tries the door a trap is sprung. We get fucked up by some ghosts, and [[Jade]] attacks [[Rez]] to unconsciousness, but [[Hugh]] heals her. The ghostly figure keeps going back into an orb, a [[broken necrotic crystal]]. [[Freya]] breaks it and kills the ghost, and we see that when it dies for real the orb eminates a soft light with weird sigils and langauges glowing inside it.

Once the fight is cleared, we settle down to catch our breath.
