# Detailed Notes: Session 146

Searching [[Zormvrik]]'s remains, we find a gold crown, black metal helmet with a scar over the right eye, and a gray silk shawl but they don't seem to currently have a magical air. An inert royal scepter. He wears a ring, with a wolf's skull on it's face made of bone, and a dunamancy scroll called gravity sinkhole. 

We learn [[Shen]]'s name used to be [[Shen|Shen|Ophalek]], he can't remember his last name. He doesn't remember most things from his life before. The rift to [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] is in [[Gu’athrithen]], the mine here is just a side-effect of that. 

[[Shen]] says he can take us to the location where they got back up, it's about 2 miles away in the wastes. We wonder if it might be an portal to [[The Shadowfell]]? He says things come out of it sometimes,

At the entrance we see an extremely skinny blue draconic [[Turgyd]], wearing ratty dirty clothes, he seems very relieved to see us. He's worked here for a year, he's part of [[Gu’athrithen]]'s [[Blue Dragon Special Forces]], a section of the [[Army of Gu'athrithen]] that protects miners. [[Rez]] warns everyone in [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] not to mention who we are or that we're on work for [[Eberron]]. 

[[Jalene]], through [[Bek]], thanks us and says [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] restored her faith in the [[Material Plane]]. 

[[Turgyd]] says that there's several other locations with large weapon stores. He says he has no loyalty to the [[Zhakastin Expedition]] and only spent a few years in [[Gu’athrithen]]. His parents were part of the [[Blue Dragon Special Forces]], and he just fell into it. He worked in some other mines, [[Girth Glade]] and (another). He just wants to get out of here alive, and maybe find another mine to work out? He worships [[Oghma]]. 

We look at the spike that was successful for [[Shen]], it was made of ruby and obsidian. There's no dunamancy core now, but there might have been before it was removed. 

[[Jalene]], [[Bek]], and [[Shraule]] depart for the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. 

We go to clear our the rest of the [[Zhakastin Expedition]]. Some of the miner bunks are caved in. The barracks are normal, however, and [[Turgyd]] is able to reclaim his belongings, armor, and weapons. [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Freya]] look through the trunks, finding some personal things: including a sewing kit with a fine silver thimble with a "V" engraved [[Vredok]]. We also find a large stack of letters belonging to [[Tythet]]. There were several very recently re-deaded skeletons.

[[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] go to the armory but are too thrown off by being alone-ish with each other. [[Costi]] joins and finds a large box, inside is a deconstructed warforged. It's got an enhanced fist that we decide to give to [[Hugh|Finn]] with a bit of different context. It has a serrateed motorized knife inside. [[Rez]] swaps him that for [[Tythet]]'s letters in draconic. They're love letters with their wife. 

The upper miner bunks are empty of anything noteworthy. As we approach the Dining #2, [[Shen]] says it's another experimental space. There are 41 corpses pinned to the wall. There are more [[necromantic spikes]]: 5 spikes are pinned, 2 of them still forming mutilated corpses. 

Birch - inert
Iron - inert
Silver - inert
Emerald - active
Obsidian - active, includes a purple dunamantic core

[[Freya]] does the same lead box tactic, is able to get the emerald one out of the wall, but slips while trying to pull out the obsidian. It sucks out energy from her, leaving her hurt and exhausted. But when she tries again, is able to remove it from the wall. 

As we come back the cart path, [[Freya]] climbs us up each one by one. [[Shen]] still steps through the stone (which we confirm he couldn't do before). 

We split up to save the undead on the way out. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Rez]], [[Freya]] and [[Shen]] go by way of the room of fire and knives, [[Costi]], [[Hugh|Finn]], and [[Turgyd]] go down the shipping lane to try and free the ox. The ox are decaying bodies, they choose to release the souls. It seems like they're gone. There's no sign of the elemental. The room is cold now. 

[[Shen]] shares some of his childhood memory, grew up in [[Gu’athrithen]], with his parents and younger sister. Was in the military, patrolling the [[Turian Waste]]. He says the [[Draconic Council]] doesn't allow much religious worship, there's no love lost for [[Tiamat]]. It's ruled by a few blue dragons, he doesn't remember their names.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] reconvenes, and as the air elementals soul leaves the jar it also seems to be gone. We head back into the [[Turian Waste]]. On our walk, [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]] talk about the decision they're faced on whether they have to kill [[Shen]] due to [[Costi]]'s allegiance to [[The Raven Queen]]. 

We try our best to sneak to the portal [[Shen]] mentioned. [[Turgyd]] tells [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] some more about the weapons stores he's seen, like in two spots: one near [[Deregheir]], one near the [[Narathian Plains]], in a few different mines or storage points. He says people were mentioning invading [[Eberron]] - though he doesn't know if that's official or not. They said the wanted to make it to [[Ordentan Lake]] on the border [[Eberron]] and the [[Slavaadi College]]. There's a few draconics [[Turgyd]] knew were involved [[Nura]] [[Frydrydirth]] and [[Typyphius]].

[[Freya]] tracks our path. The sun begins to set, as we get deeper into the Wastes [[Rez]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] smell the swampy rotting water that reminded us of [[The Shadowfell]]. There's a 300x80 foot area where suddenly we're surrounded by marsh. Bones are in the water, some with blue scaled flesh still on them. It seems like this might be where many of the previous search parties might've ended up. 

[[Freya]] asks [[The Curator]] if they know what this is (yes), we can touch it (yes), and will it hurt us (no). [[Rez]] agrees it's safe. [[Samuel]] also mostly agrees. He agrees to fly over the area to see if there's anything lurking in the waters. 

We head into the marsh. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] searching for the epicenter, [[Rez]] trying to see where [[The Shadowfell]] feels strongest. They're both pulled to the true center of this swamp. [[Costi]] recognizes that none of this is part of the [[Material Plane]] at all. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] asks [[TrueSilver]] asking "Who or what created this and what can be done about it" - the desert around becomes plain for a moment, then a spike appears about 40 feet ahead of him, a black jagged rip. As it slams into the ground, liquid death and decay spills around it, before sticking in place. The black spike vanishes. 

[[Freya]] starts to notice more movement in the water, bubbles break the surface, breaking as another Hungry comes through, along with a Lonely, and some Wretched. We kill them without too much trouble. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] decides to try dispelling the swamp from the epicenter, a slit in the ground where a sword might once have been. As his silver starts to seep in, we hear a soft pop behind us. It's a 3 foot high halfling, in all black armor. She attacks [[Hugh|Finn]]. [[Rez]] yells at her to stop.

After getting a few good hits, she seems to hear [[Rez]] - turning to look at her, she recognizes her, and immediately asks what she exactly she thinks she's doing, young lady. [[Rez]] introduces [[Rez's Mom]] to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. She's [[Kaycee Teapetal]]!

Pretty much immediately, she scolds [[Rez]] for lying about who she is. [[Rez]] tries to convince her mom and the party not to say anything outloud, but [[Costi]] pieces things together, and announces she's a dragon. Turns out [[Rez]] has lied A LOT. And yet somehow this all makes sense now. 

[[Rez]] gets a number of scared sendings from [[Rez's Family]]. 
* [[Magister]]: “From [[Vask]], where are you Rez this isn’t funny respond right now I’ll be there Rez, Rez, Rez, please, Rez?”
* [[Zmaj]]: “Rez, what happened? Report back immediately, are you safe? We can send the silvers to you.”
* [[Eirian]]: “They didn’t get you too, did they? Rez, are you okay? This is a rough time for one of your pranks.”
* [[Li]]: “I’m sending agents to your location immediately, don’t move. Respond if you aren’t in danger.”
* [[Simin]]: “You just got out, right? We can commiserate over a pint, right? Come on Rez.”

She responds to each of them with "I'm alive!!! I'm with MOM, I'm sorry!! I'm OKAY"

[[Kaycee Teapetal]] swaps some stories, answers some questions, and then invites us to the [[Rotted Grotto]] -- she'll tell us the new location in the [[Turian Waste]]. But if it really matters to [[Rez]], she'll move this swamp skylight to a new location. So that's good! However, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is a bit too sassy, so she gets dragged through [[The Shadowfell]]. Which, is very not good. 

[[Kaycee Teapetal]] learns from [[Rez]] that [[Rez's Dad|Azir]] hasn't been heard from in a while ([[Azir Is Missing]]) - she offered to ask [[Gemma]] if she knows anything. [[Rez]] also mentions the [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]] attacks on [[Rez's Family]] - [[Kaycee Teapetal]] says she'll come talk to her later to learn more. 

[[Shen]] offers to go go with [[Kaycee Teapetal]] back to [[The Shadowfell]], and [[Turgyd]] decides why not - he'll go too. We all book it out of there so [[Mr. Blueberry]]'s skylight can be moved somewhere else.
