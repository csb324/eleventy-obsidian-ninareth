# Detailed Notes: Session 46

For recap, see also: [[session-46]]

We all walk around and discuss what kind of dinner guests we will be for the [[Threthdia Assassination]]. Remembering we should not be seen heading there, we try to sneak there. 

When we get to [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s house, a [[Dragon's Hide|Hidesman]] named [[Tobias]] is waiting and standing guard. He immediately recognizes us, and escorts us into a living chamber. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] casts divine sense, turns out [[Tobias]] is fey. Another [[Dragon's Hide|Hidesman]], woodelven woman with long brown hair,  comes in with two saint bernhards. [[Costi]] looks beneath her disguise, and she's got glowing golden skin with thick yellow hair waving down her back, Tobis says she's named [[Zendra]]. The dogs are named Duke and Nuke. 

She serves us all tea, that is EXTREMELY compelling to drink. [[Costi]], [[Freya]], and [[Rez]] all withstand the temptation, but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] seems drawn in, and sips it. We learn that Tobias has been with [[Threthdia Scrivit]] for a long (long) time. He leaves us to prepare dinner, and we all try to investigate the room but don't come up with anything. 

When he returns, he escorts out of the room saying "dinner will be served in the garden", and as soon as we enter a long hallway, we feel ourselves pulled into a bright green energy and are PLANE SHIFTED TO THE FEYWILD.

After gawking at the scenery and perpetual twilight sky, we don't notice that we're in quicksand. [[Hugh]] and [[Freya]] jump out immediately, but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Rez]], and [[Costi]] don't realize until their feet are covered. Everyone begins to sink, but through some magical means and some sheer ability, we manage to escape. Catching our breath, [[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] realize we may actually be in the feywild. We start walking, and several more sand traps lay in around u, but the keen eyes of [[Hugh]] and [[Freya]] keep us safe. The trees thin as we move along the path, and as we progress we come across a series of four islands, connected by bridges, each sitting on small ponds. 

[[Costi]] brings out [[Samuel]], who seems to have some serious trouble existing here. He announces his displeasure, and struggle to eat a beetle, before taking a lap of the lake so [[Costi]] can check it out. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s rose from [[Corellon Larethian]] starts to glow. [[Costi]] tries to take his sword from [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] and cut a vine, they unsucessfully wrestled him for the sword, then told him no thank you by boping him on his nose. 

We make our way to the islands, and as we step through the dew on the first, a green mist rises around us. From the far island, we hear a howling as two large dogs with sad human faces face us, along with [[Zendra]]. Knocking an arrow, she tells us "dinner is delayed". Turns out the fey are tricksy and we spend a lot of time being frightened, running away, and imagining things - but in the end, despite pressing dates with wierd trouts with arms and faces, we kill [[Zendra]]. [[Hugh]] skins a yeath hound, [[Costi]] takes a lock of her hair. He then proceeds to talk to the fish, which then attempts to strangle him, triggering his armor of agathys -- turning into popsicle.

Recapping the fight, we continue in the direction that the trees are thinnest. Eventually, we approach a hedge mazes. They're very pointy, and grow arms that throw you to the ground if you attempt to outsmart them. Debating our approach to solving it, [[Rez]] happily volunteers that she LOVES mazes, to go to them and make them. With some general assistance nagivating from [[Costi]] and [[Freya]], [[Rez]] runs in happily. Almost playing together, [[Rez]] run through laughing and guides [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] into a peaceful glade. 

It seems frozen in time, in a very safe way. A small young willow tree dances in the breeze in the center, and [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] takes a short rest. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] plays her harp, and four more [[Corellon Larethian]] blessed roses have grown around her. [[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] hang out with tree. [[Costi]] buries the fish he murdered, guilty now that the blood lust fades. [[Freya]] meditates in nature, and feels a warmth over most of her whole body, well except just a pinprick.

We talk to the tree about [[Corellon Larethian]], and the hedge maze. It shows us the way out! We run through, getting a bit scrapped but not stuck. We find ourselves in what appears to be [[Threthdia Scrivit]]'s garden. Everything is larger and oversized. As we step in, we hear "It's terribly mean to be late for dinner"
