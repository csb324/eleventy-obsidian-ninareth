# Detailed Notes: Session 103

We wake up, [[Costi]] identifies [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]]'s sword, it's [[Blood Curler]] (A) - +1 long sword, does 1d10 necrotic. On a hit, expand a charge (2 per day) to require a DC 17 Con SVT or be stunned until the end of your next round.

[[Hugh]] has a sweet moment thanking [[TrueSilver]]. Hugging [[Freya]], she thanks him for saving her but says it would've been okay if he could not. 

[[Hugh]] greater restorations [[Rez]] to help her health return to what it was before all the vampire bites.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to remember the death melody from [[Corellon Larethian]]'s afterlife, and while weird, it starts to come back to her. 

We discuss if [[Halv]] should go to the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], and decide hopefully but we should talk to him. 

[[Freya]] brings up we should determine if we go back to the [[Burbank Compound]] or [[New Fairhaven]]. When we say we don't even know if the [[Alhoon]] [[Mhrhaal]] was still there, and [[Freya]] says [[The Curator]] told visited her after her death. She didn't make any new deals, but was told she would be warned if mrthral left [[New Fairhaven]], but at least, as of last night, he was there. 

We head to the barracks, and are greeted by [[Trisha]]'s personal guard [[Kelce]]. We're lead to her office to debrief. We share that we heavily tinted our reports to [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] and give her a full accounting from arriving in [[Viliki]]. In particular, we also try to arrange an introduction between [[Marina Alduchev]] and her, as they seem to be likeminded. We tell that [[Shari's Boys]] were both helpful but also problematically involved, but flag the high number of children. We pivot to [[Halv]], and seems open to him working at the [[Burbank Compound]], but suggests we extract him for his own sake. 

We plan to leave at 2 pm to get back on the road together. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to coach [[Hugh]] on how to talk to [[Halv]], rather than kidnapping him. [[Rez]] sends message as a ghost to create the chance, "I arranged new life for you as thanks for helping. Meet captivating red-haired woman at Flagon - 1:30 - travel with her and Burbanks, be free." He responds, "O-kay. Probably. Running away now."
