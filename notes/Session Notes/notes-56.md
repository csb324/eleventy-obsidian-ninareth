# Detailed Notes: Session 56

For recap, see also: 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes to talk to [[Kent Lander]] about his involvement with the cave system. A youngish man in his mid-twenties. Overwhelmed with his colicky child, we all go out back to ask him what he knows, fueled by beer from [[Giary]]. He had a hunch that you could get into the "old mining tunnels" from some of the cave system, where he found a small copper deposit. He thinks if they go deeper they could stop tilling the land. He points us to the entrance by [[Vorhmen]]'s house, there's tunnels in the cavern that he cleared some. 

He says [[Arkhosia (City)]] is a mining town that dug pretty far back into the mountains, and he thought he could find one of those, particularly one used to mine gold. He's been digging around for about four months, but found the copper about two days ago. He's yet to find to find anything dangerous, though his arm did get stuck at one point, which might have been a web. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] approaches the caves, and [[Jade]] tells us to watch our for webs, since that's how spiders know what's around them. [[Hugh]] flicks his eyes and looks out to guide our steps. We enter into a wide circular cavern with a pathway ahead, there's no signs of webs. As we progress, the tunnels get more rough-hewn like they were recently cleared. We almost all walk right into a large pit, and [[Costi]], acting on his intrusive thoughts, drops the light pebble down to triangulate the depth. Turns out it's about 120ft down, and 8ft across. [[Hugh]] is able to see that it didn't hit any of the webs, of which there are many, by a sheer miracle. 

We strategize on what to do, and decide to create a long rope of fire and a ring of tar on fire around the pit. [[Giary]] and [[Freya]] hold up [[Rez]] who plans to blender with the rope. Remarkably deft, we burn through most of the webbing. After a scout checks out the damage, 3 large spiders come to deal with the issue. 

[[Rez]] started strong, then went very bad. Restrained in web, covered by her own net, she plummets down the hole, begins to cut herself loose, then when the rope is cut by spiders, almost falls to her death but whistles with [[Blow Em]]! Instead of flying to her freedom though, she's a floating, restrained, spider snack - 10ft above the spider creature invested ground. [[Giary]] jumps in after her and drags [[Freya]] down with him. [[Hugh]] shakes the caves to throw off the spiders aim, [[Costi]] and [[Jade]] throw magic and miraculously hit spiders.

We all try to group up at the bottom together, and [[Hugh]] dimensions them down right before [[Costi]] turns into [[Costi|Cost-ape]]. We get to the bottom and fight so many spider monsters. [[Freya]] slices through any she touches, [[Hugh]] summons some holy dwarf gossips, [[Jade]] makes another ghost friend and sickens half the swarm. But as more and more keep coming, we realize we need to bring down the tunnels they go through rather than trying to kill them. [[Costi]] holds off one of the tunnles using the fancy new [[Cube of Force]]. 

[[Rez]] has an idea. Using her new ability to create objects from nothing, she builds a dynamite bomb and chucks it into one of the tunnels. Bug goo, and the tunnel collapses. [[Costi]] throws a fireball, but it works mostly on bugs and not rock. [[Rez]] offers him another bomb, and he throws it *perfectly*. The tunnel collapses, spilling copper everywhere. It's BEAUTIFUL.

[[Rez]] scrambles to get some copper, and right as [[Costi]] asks for folks to carve up spider people the tunnel... begins to shake. We all try to figure our way out. [[Giary]] takes [[Blow Em]] and hoists up [[Rez]] and [[Jade]]. [[Hugh]] and [[Freya]] begin climbing, [[Hugh]] getting hit with rocks on the way. [[Costi]] turns into [[Costi|Cost-ape]] to climb. 

Dogding falling rocks, we make our way out of the cavern.
