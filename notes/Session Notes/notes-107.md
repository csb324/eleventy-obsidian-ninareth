# Detailed Notes: Session 107

[[Hugh|Finn]] talks with [[Marigold]] about the isolation he feels, that [[Eva Sidorev|Eva]] lived a whole life without him - and he missed it all. She comforts him and reminds him that there's a reason for living outside of those he cares about, and it's himself. They process some of their anger at the injustice of it together, and [[Marigold]] takes care of [[Hugh|Finn]], remind him that they are [[SVN models]], and they don't break. They're family. He sleeps there and says goodbye on the morning of our [[Don't Tell Teld]] mission. 

[[Costi]] sends [[Samuel]] to count tents for [[Don't Tell Teld]], its a little hard for him to make out. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] does some chatting about how we want to handle helping the [[ELA]], while hopefully hurting (or killing) [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], and keeping a good relationship with [[Cliff Burbank]]. 

We make our way through [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]] camp, getting a lot of hostility to [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]]. The vibe is much more tense and hurried than the rest of the [[Burbank Compound]]. We arrive to the main tent right on time, and see a group of about 20 people along with a map of the [[Burbank Compound]] and surrounding area. There's a main group; older halfling man short salt pepper hair missing middle finger right hand, green and yellow tiefling woman with a breastplate and large corkscrewing horns and black eyes, a human woman, a goblin in ragtag leathers carrying a cat of nine-tails, in the center is [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]. He's an older minotaur, with graying fur, lots of muscle but some weight on top of it. He has a broken horn and a number of facial piercings, with well-worn armor and a huge tower shield on his back. He carries a giant axe seemingly made of bones forged together. His left hand is horrifically mangled and appears unusable. 

He clearly sets a harsh tone, threatens [[Hugh|Finn]] and tells us not to expect special treatment. As we sit, [[Costi]] gets an unpleasant religious sense from the axe but isn't immediately sure of who the evil entity it's affiliated with is. 

He tells us that in his interrogation of [[Nicky]], 3 camps of [[ELA]] cells located within 3 days of the [[Burbank Compound]], with nefarious intents, potentially an attack within the coming months. He wants to get ahead of that, root them out, and bring some survivors back to interrogate. Claims it's the best chance to get ahead of them. 

We learn that the halfling, Sgt [[Dispek Dradleston]] is a strategist who developed a way to saying the strategy comes from hunting animals, when he was a member of the [[Thelran Asari Army]]. They want to comb out hints of camps, will have 80 groups of around 10 to look for signs of the camps. He is not from [[Eberron]]. We will decide how to eradicate them once we find them. [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] wants to bring back 90% heads 10% captives. 

We'll be under Sgt [[Colvia Ghul]] - human in robes. We'll be with 5 of her "trusted devotees," making up a tine. She'll be our lead, and any of our info should go through her first. It's been made clear that she'll be with us the whole time, and is leaning into counter-terrorism work - she wants to pick our brains. She is making notes in a journal of what we say, our individual skills, and any indiscretions of [[Hugh|Finn]]. 

The camps have been able to stay hidden, so we're trying to determine where they are and how they've been able to stay off of [[Trisha]]'s radar. They've operated largely in the mountains in the past, this is furthest in to [[Eberron]] they've seen, outside [[Deal 'Ras]]. 

Sgt. [[Fingers]], the tiefling, always looks at [[Costi]] when [[Deal 'Ras]] mentioned. [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] seems to be exasperated talking about her, she called him [[Grishomec Teld|Gray Fur]], which he did not like. She gesticulates a lot. She's acting shitty, but the most annoyed person is [[Dispek Dradleston]]. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] asks who the goblin is, and we learn he's [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]'s attache named [[Nine Tails]].

He reiterates that we should not take any actions to jeopardize the mission without express orders from [[Colvia Ghul]], [[Rez]] presses back a little that we have been authorized by [[Cliff Burbank]] and we'll use that - but only if needed. He encourages that not to be the case, and says he will send us back if needed. 

[[Freya]] looks at the map they have laid out, and internalizes it naturally. It seems like the camps are located 3ish days march through the woods, southwest of the camps. There are some marked ravines and a ruined town named [[Golstrava]], one of the many destroyed in the [[The Second Sundering]]. It looks like [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] will be in the center, near [[Golstrava]] overseeing about 20 groups. [[Colvia Ghul]] is overseeing a similar amount near the ravines. [[Fingers]] is left of the ruins in a marshy area. Interspersed throughout will be led by [[Dispek Dradleston]], seemingly to help with operating strategy. Paths are marked out for groups, though it's not super clear the entire strategy, with fall back plans and supply lists. It's well thought out.

[[Rez]] asks if they've had moles, but it's mixed success - they are surprisingly good at sussing them out, though the [[Eberronian Military]] is not sure how. Any information we can provide them would be "enormously helpful". It seems like there is not an anti-[[ELA]] division within the [[Eberronian Second Division]], though they would like to lean in here. 

He warns us that they plan to take as long as it takes to be successful, even if it's months. [[Freya]] asks about drinking, everyone's allowed one ration of wine when not actively working. She asks if she can switch for lendeth, and [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] fakes interest just to pour it on the ground. 

[[Colvia Ghul]] tells us to find her banner and wait under there. We take our leave and arrive after a short walk. We see in each camp at least one person stripped to the waist, with what appears like whip scars. [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] strikes each of them twice, and adding another lash if they cry out. [[Costi]] spots one of the religious devotees wears a symbol to [[Ioun]]. We all take a moment to internalize what's happening, and [[Freya]] plans to always be the last to arrive at our check ins. 

We head out on our expedition, spending the next few hours marching in formation - near the front of the column, behind [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] and his closest sergeants. [[Rez]] attempts to socialize without drawing attention, but isn't exactly making friends. [[Costi]] finally reads about undead SO well - he really gets a thorough understanding about vampires. He learns general tips that vampires are largely gone, very rare, and describes two historical vampires - it's clearly propaganda but has accurate information on their workings. [[Costi]] also makes a bit of a show playing around with our [[Ioun Stone]] to see if it draws anyone's attention. 

We notice that there is a higher density of racial breakdown, including those of "monstrous races". The troops seem very serious, and it almost seems like those of monstrous descent might be more dour. None have clear brands or shackles. 

After about four hours, [[Colvia Ghul]] comes up to tell us it's time to get started. She asks how we are at stealth, and are very ourselves about it. She calls a dark-skinned human named [[Bouzad Rukhol]] and asks him to help make us stealthy - then introduced the rest of [[Iounians|her top team]]: [[Jamzik Zodevzo]], [[Bez]], [[Grizaf]], [[Ignatz]] in platemail.

We begin spacing out throughout the woods, mostly being extremely quiet, though [[Hugh|Finn]] struggles to not make a sound, perhaps intentionally? 

As we walk [[Colvia Ghul]] starts to ask all of us about our unique skills. We try and give info but not be outright helpful. [[Rez]] says she's good at everything, but in a fight prefers to distract rather than do the hurting herself, you know, a little "tickle tickle". 

[[Colvia Ghul]] offers [[Costi]] the chance to read more accurate information on undead when we return. [[Costi]] says his skills are adaptable, sword or his learnings as the situation is called for. He does say he tries his best to avoid being bitten or cut directly. He admits to being more in practice with the book. She also calls out that [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] and [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] don't have the best relationship, but [[Costi]] does his best to brush it off. She also specifically says she "does not hold the sins of the father against the son", and seems sincere? 

We learn that her, and her core group, are people of faith - also more comfortable with the book than the blade (though she carries a scythe on a chain). She also doesn't like to be bitten or cut directly. They plan to talk more about their shared similarities over the campfire. 

Approaching [[Freya]], she says it seems clear but never wants to assume. [[Freya]] offers to fight anyone, with permission of course, and reiterates that she likes to fight. [[Colvia Ghul]] seems to make some pointed references to [[Polaris]]. Talking about lendeth, [[Colvia Ghul]] apologizes about [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], saying he took out some frustrations on her, that it was a tough morning - with how powerful people have politics that conflict when trying to do the same thing. [[Freya]] definitely knows all about that. She also shares that she died and came back, [[Colvia Ghul]] is not worried, if she were undead she'd either be registered or killed by [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]]. She says she's been researching [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] for the last 3 months. [[Freya]] climbs a tree to prove her skillset.

Talking with [[Hugh|Finn]], she says he's got many new skills courtesy of [[TrueSilver]], in additions to those in his records of his military past. It is much more tense, though they talk about his new crossbow arm, and least technically. He is also a healer. She tries to push for more but [[Hugh|Finn]] will not engage. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] tries to see into why she's asking such thorough questions about each of us, and she says it's to help position our work together in upcoming combat, and we don't know more than that. 

[[Rez]] tries to socialize with the rest of the team. [[Ignatz]] will not speak and wears armor, [[Bez]] the male half-orc, is a healer, [[Bouzad Rukhol]], seems to be a ranger and the second least chatty, [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] was the one who got whipped, wears lots of weapons, [[Gizraf]] a male Gnome who tinkers, likely an Artificer, very excited to talk about what he's working on. He really wants to talk to [[Hugh|Finn]]. They all seem nice, and everyone except [[Ignatz]] seems to be a follower of [[Ioun]]. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] uses [[Maurice]] to help distract as he does his next sending check-in to [[Costi's mom]]. It seems like [[Colvia Ghul]] might have been watching as it happened. [[Freya]] talks to [[Guu]] at the same time.

A few hours later, she tells our team to spread out a bit more as all of the groups will be a bit more spread thin. After an hour, we come across a black glistening rock, but it's breathing? [[Costi]] looks through it and can see inside there is a divot with a very large humanoid creature.

We learn it's not technically undead, though we had slightly more trouble than expected, [[Freya]] going down, and [[Rez]] too - though she naturally sprung awake to blow fire and kill the giant. [[Hugh|Finn]] kept everyone alive, [[Freya]] took SO much damage, and [[Costi]] dropped from above in a swirl of swords. However, acid from the Elder Ooze eats through a lot of our armor or skin, which feels all too familiar for [[Rez]]. 

We also notice that the rock the not-undead giant came out of has a tunnel downwards. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] discusses if we should ignore it or report it, in case it's leading to an [[ELA]] hideout. We ask [[Hugh|Finn]] to send and check, he hears back "Ask me again in two minutes", [[Rez]] creates a rock cover to hide the entrance just in case they come here. [[Hugh|Finn]] hears back "It would be best if they didn't know about this passageway"

[[Costi]] tries to investigate and see why it appears undead and if it's created, with the help of [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Rez]]. Theres an extremely faint scar, as though made by a scalpel. He uses mage hand to check the area, it bumps into something but can't pull it out. He uses his sword to excavate the area. With [[Freya]]'s help, a small green cylinder is unearthed, clearly magical. [[Rez]] sendings to [[Pruvki Forgaveat]] asking if they made creatures like this, he replied: "What? No, what? Has the [[ELA]] been lead astray. You need to give me more information about this. I will ask around". 

Right as we're talking about what to do, we make the call that if the giant was magically created, it was probably [[Eberronian Military]], which means it's probably a test. However, we remember this is not the first time [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] has seen an augmented giant ([[There's Plainly Something Wrong with the Planes]]). So we decide to own up about the vial, and remove the fake covering of the passage. We'll deny seeing it but won't get caught covering it up.
