# Session 168

Before bed, we talk more about [[Gulsindip Desindever|Superior Desindever]], his untrustworthiness from our code breaking of [[Kith and Kin]], and remember [[Skiv]], her ties to [[Rawley]] and [[Polaris]] and her unspecified feud with [[Gulsindip Desindever|Superior Desindever]], that caused her to leave the [[Wayfinders]].

In the night, [[Costi]] is visited by [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]]. He's able to see through the illusion. He says [[The Raven Queen]] took away his cool eyes but now he can do silent image. 

The next morning, we were joking about warlock pacts and [[Rez]] ending up talking about knowing the [[Cult of the Butterfly Queen]], it is (was?) her Aunt [[Gemma]]. She's one of [[Tiamat]]'s jailers. But all of that is a BIG ol secret. So shh. But it's another point towards trusting [[Samson]]. 

[[Rez]] sendings [[Eirian]] before going to the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Thelran Asari]], "Hey - have you spent much time at the Platinum Sanctuary here?? Think they've been infested too or are they clear? I'm going today! Unless no?" she replies, "Since [[Jalantar]], I've stayed away just in case. Figured we'd go back once we knew who to cart out. Assume someone is compromised, at least." [[Rez]] begrudgingly decides to hold off then. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Eva Sidorev|Eva]], "I can meet quickly tonight or I’ll be free two nights from now", she replies, "Could we do next week? The next couple days are a challenge, but after next Feastsday I am wide open!"

[[Freya]] goes to spend the day at the [[Equinox Citadel]].

[[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]] plan to go to their two respective holy sites, [[Rez]] tags along with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to the [[Rooted Grove]]. They're all close to [[The Heart]], where almost everyone is in religiously affiliated garb. We arrive at the [[Plaza of the Faithful]] and then divide up. 

At the [[Rooted Grove]], it's covered in ivy and wildflowers, with large weeping willows shadow the front gate. The ground is covered in roots, starting of normal size and up to huge wall like partitions leading to the central building. [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] banter, [[Rez]]'s only goal is spend time with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], who is pretty unsettled by that. 

Mid-way on their explorations, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] stumble upon two girls making out. It quickly gets very weird. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] halfway tries to ask them about who to talk to, but they both recognize her as a [[Adrienne Spout|Blue Rose]] and also there's a strange tension with [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and the two girls. [[Rez]] actually picks up on that, and starts to piece together that 1) [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s been a bit weird since the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]], 2) she's not sharing a room with [[Rez]] anymore, and 3) she's been pulling away. On purpose. Hmmmm.

Finally arriving at the central structure, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] finds the main building also made of us thick root and tree structure. A Grovetender, [[Daepeiros Yolpheronnia]], a man in their 50's who comes up to greet [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], immediately recognizing her. She asks to speak to the [[High Grovetender]]. 

After 15 minutes of waiting (in which the reassuring touch of [[Rez]] causes more problems than it tried to solve), a tall thin older woman, with intricate knotted roots on their arms, chest, and shoulders, approaches and invites [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to speak somewhere more privately. She leads them into the core trunk of the tree, and sings a small chamber up to the canopy, where there's a patio of sorts.

[[High Grovetender]] [[Umenelis Wocornalkint]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks if [[Willow]] has been here, [[Umenelis]] says yes, 8 years ago. [[Willow]] told her to tend to the the [[Adrienne Spout|Blue Rose]] when it blooms. According to her, he's not always easy to understand, but he's never wrong. [[Umenelis]] does not know [[Wyn Elreal]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] alludes to our [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]] but doesn't speak plainly. [[Umenelis]] says there has been an uptick in those who feel called to train to protect the Grove under [[Corellon Larethian]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to learn more about what [[Corellon Larethian]] wants from her, unfortunately [[Umenelis]] doesn't know more anyone else. She guides that we all learn what [[The Gods]] want from us through acts of service, and her journey will be unique to her, and seemingly, important. [[Umenelis]] offers to be a guide, if she can, and to help provide the resource she needs. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] does say that it seems like a number of gods are calling people, like her. [[Umenelis]] says she serves on [[Thelran Asari Council]] with the other heads of the religious temples. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] end up telling her the whole story of [[Resurrect Adrienne]], [[Rez]] interviewing that the [[Rez's Family|Metallic Dragons]] are supposed to be helping to try and gain insight on with what. [[Umenelis]] asks if she can work with the other temple heads to help find out more, we ask her to wait a few days for us to make contacts in those orders. She offers to keep it quiet, for now, but looks forward to when she can truly help. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] strategize on when to go to the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Thelran Asari]] and the [[Temple of Pelor in Thelran Asari]], deciding to wait for after the [[Boulder Makers Counterattack]] and when [[Freya]] returns, respectively. Then [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] plays the harp for the [[Rooted Grove]] attendees. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] leads the way to the [[Sunfire Forge]] of [[Moradin]]. It's a working building, in contrast to the rest of the [[Plaza of the Faithful]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] gets help heading to [[TrueSilver]]'s hearth within the building. They're escorted by the sweetest girl, [[Eiradel Sundu]], who's from [[Zilvengrod]] and is going to ask if her parents know [[Hugh|Finn]]. It takes a minute, and a few wrong doors, but they get there. She tells [[Hugh|Finn]] that no one is formally in charge here, few outside of [[Zilvengrod]] or [[K'falgaard|Kfalgaard]] has structure, though it sounds like the one in [[Jalantar]] is now requested formal resources too. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] approaches a devotee tending the hearth, he has a unruly red beard and an intricate black steel choker. He introduces himself as [[Bargran Thruker]] and shares that they're all equal in [[Thelran Asari]]. They bond over their devotion to [[TrueSilver]], and he asks for [[Hugh|Finn]]'s help tending the fire. [[Hugh|Finn]] asks [[Father Thronestone]] who he should connect with, he says to give him a few days and he'll set up a meeting. 

After a few hours of quiet time tending the hearth, [[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] head down towards [[Mombant Park]] to the [[Cemetery of Thelran Asari]] where there's a small chapel to [[The Raven Queen]]. [[Samuel]] asks [[Costi]] if he can do something, and in getting permission guides him into borrowing knowledge to understand thieves cant.

They approach a bandshell, with unlit black candles throughout, and a feather pattern in cut black stone along the walls. [[Costi]] sits to meditate, lighting one of the candles. Hearing nothing, he tries to ask [[Samuel]] for more advice beyond "listen", but doesn't get much back. He turns inward to try to listen of [[The Raven Queen]]'s presence in this site. [[Costi]] is hit by a compulsion to move, and in wandering through the graves bumps into a young woman. He uses his thieves cant to say "I don't know what I'm doing". She uses the tail end of their conversation to reply "He sent me, you're not alone here", rubbing her thumb over a black hilted knife at her belt. Checking his pocket, [[Costi]] finds a note saying "[[Sorni Gomadril]] and an address in [[West Shore]]"

On the way back to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]:
* [[Costi]] sends to [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]], "Finally learned this stupid spell. Always seemed like lots of magic for few words. Met with [[Nadia]]. She's good! Miss you and Dad", she replies, "Oh good, I’m glad we can finally talk just us. Good! Give her our love, we miss you too."
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sends to [[Wyn Elreal]], "Been a while. In [[Thelran Asari]]. Revisiting [[New Fairhaven]] after [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]] — relevant. New [[Duke v'Dharinov]] is a friend, if you need one. News? Be careful." he replies, "Good to know. We're still gearing up, but are heading into [[Eberron]] soon. Seems smart to make [[Jezeten]] our first stop."
