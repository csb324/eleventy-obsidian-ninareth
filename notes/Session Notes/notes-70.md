# Detailed Notes: Session 70

We double check everything that we stole is in [[my hole]], and taking stock of how we feel decide to figure out how to get a long rest. [[Costi]] becomes convinced we need to block the hole we entered this level through. 

Once we get into the hut to rest [[Rez]] asks [[Hugh]] if she should sending someone she knows is dead to learn more about [[Rez's Dad]], and [[Hugh]] says he's probably dead. She tries to play it off, and the rest of the group chimes in. They try to calm her (she's totally not worried), but IF she WAS then maybe there's someone she could sending. She's not sure if he's got a lover now, he's had several friends but they're not really around. The group asks more questions and [[Rez]] gets flustered and agrees to go sending [[Rez's Mom]]

This mirror has a name [[The Gaze Grafter]], a creature that looks in the mirror within 5ft must succeed on a DC 16 saving throw or have it's featuers grafted, forever held by the mirror. A creature who has it's features grafted ccan speak a password to take the image of another creature's feature grafted. This transformation is undetectable by magical or mundane means and last for 24 hours, or until the command word is spoken again by the creature that originially altered it's features while within 10 ft of the mirror. 

[[Costi]] fesses up and we start to think of what a problem this is. He decides to try to become [[Sheske Eeping]], using the password *fromage*. He immediately shrinks and is indistinguishable. We all ponder what it would mean to give [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] the power to embody [[Costi]], and try to figure how to prevent giving him this mirror. Remembering the second mirror, we ask [[Costi]] to carefully look at the larger one. 

It's a [[Mirror of Life Trapping]], and we learn all about it. We decide to look and see who's in all the cells. There's only three things: a lost and confused man from [[Thelran Asari]], the [[Eberronian Military]] [[General Korsas]], and some very large devil.

We pack up, [[Jade]] keeping the smaller mirror out of [[my hole]] - secretly messaging [[Rez]] that we should be sure it gets destroyed while we're down here, but not to tell the rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] so they don't have to lie to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. 

We start to travel down the tunnel, and make it to the end, where it seems to finish at floor 43. [[Freya]] detects that it smells like [[Damien]]'s house. [[Rez]] asks how [[Samuel]] feels about undead before he goes to scout ahead, he makes it clear he does NOT like them. We decide to be sneaky and move forward. We struggle to stay quiet and eventually reach a fork in the tunnel. [[Samuel]] heads down the right tunnel before running into some trouble and disappearing, it makes [[Costi]] get a bad taste in his mouth. It seems like about 200 ft down the right side there's a trap or something bad. We decide to go with the devil (tunnel) we know, bringing some small amont of hooded light. [[Costi]] uses the [[Cube of Force]] to filter out airborne containments in case that helps protect us. 

As we're walking, we see a creature's knee break through the stone and a glowing red eye causes [[Jade]], [[Rez]], and [[Costi]] suddenly fall upwards and hit the ceiling. We're acosted by these rotting skeletal hands that are unnatrually strong. We break free and after a small amount of trouble we run away. 

Eventually we come to a door in a well scultped wall, it's not fancy but it is well made. [[Costi]] casts detect magic and can tell that dunamancy was cast on the door. [[Hugh]] can't place where the red eye is from but it seems familiar. [[Rez]] remembers that there was a red eye necromantic in the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]] that [[Niko]] tackled. We all discuss [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]. She and [[Costi]] investigate the door further, it seems like it's magic is not from it - it feels like a dispel wouldn't fix the problem, there is a bit of a time warp around it. [[Costi]] feels like he was investigating it for a long time but only a few seconds past. 

He magically looks past the door, but even with his fine skill he only sees static. We argue for a while about if we should go thorugh the door. We vote on it, then decide to all open the door at once. It opens to reveal one of those pre-rooms with a gorgeous room. Theres 10 chairs around the center of the room, there's a large ornately pattern rug. There's one door directly across from us, with a large jeweled "D". On the left, there is a large wine rack with around 200 bottles of wine. On the right, there's a number of bookshelves with ornate books and large cabinets. There's paintings on the walls, with two hearths with burning fires on either sides. 

We enter, after a brief check to see if there's a time dilation (there doesn't seem to be), [[Jade]] and [[Rez]] go to check out the book shelves. We reach the [[Locations/Arkhosia City/Duvey Crypt|Duvey Crypt]] There's a small plaque, it says, "[[Baldred Duvey|B. Duvey]] 3369" [[Jade]] heard a rumor, of the [[Duvey Family]], they are involved in international item shipping, and they're up to some shady shit. She's heard people talking about them similarly to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. While investigating the bookshelves further, they pull out a novel that's been popular for a couple hundred years, and behind it we see a sheet of paper. It looks like older than everything else in the room, [[Jade]]'s glasses flash ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]), and unlike everything else in the room it does not seem maintained. It appears blank. It pings now on [[Costi]]'s detect magic, of illusion magic, the books in front of it were backed with lead. [[Jade]] tries to see through an illusion, but it doesn't ping. We get [[Costi]] to start to identify it. Before that, he tries to walk around sensing the dead spots, but the magic is too pervasive for him to catch a beat. His paper did not read magical, but it has illusion magic. There is nothing hidden on it though, so we're not sure how it connects. [[Hugh]] tries to draw on it, and a normal line appears. *JOE NOTE - 70-75*

[[Freya]] keeps an eye out for threats, and [[Costi]] casts detect magic to walk around. The whole room gives off a faint hum, and so do both doors. 

[[Jade]] and [[Rez]] move to look at the wines and see another plaque blocking off a few wine cubbies "[[R. Duvey]] 3284". On the center of the table there is a fine plate engraved, "[[Z. Duvey]] 3336".  The cabinets are full of food and trinkets, with three other plaques not put on anything yet, [[K. Duvey]], [[Jendorp Duvey|J. Duvey]], and [[Winifey|W. Duvey]]" but no dates listed. There are several larders that are chilled filled with food, there are the most perfect olives ever. 

[[Hugh]] finishes praying and asks, "Where can we find the missing raven feathers?" The flames breifly trun black, but not in a scary way, as the burst from the top they fall almost like feathers, spines appearing in the dancing flames. Two brids of this black flame fly overhead, and they both run the door with the ornate D on it. 

The door is not locked, there's no symbols or hidden images - it's just an ostentious and elaborate display of wealth. As we walk through, we walk into a sitting room. It looks just like the room we left. And yet, we've never seen it before. When [[Jade]] and [[Rez]] make it to the larder, some of the cheese is molded this time. We re-do everything, and eventually get to the point of making our way through the door again.

We lurch as we step through the doorway, crossing into the room where the bodies are kept, but instead of making our way there we're brought back to the start again. As we see the room again, we remember doing everything twice. The room is in disrepair, it's grown dirty and tarnished, not outright rotten but noticeably different. [[Rez]] goes to reach for the paper again, and this time it is available for her. It looks the same, with the small mark there. 

When we open the door but don't move through, we can see three raised crypts. We start to investigate the paper again, and try to match the mark to the room, but it doesn't line up. [[Costi]] adds the name Duvey but we don't notice a change. We start to debate other changes to the paper, and [[Costi]] points out something tied only to dunamancy would be purely illusion based. 

[[Rez]] steps out to sending to [[Ravona Drakness]] to see if there's a time dilation, she says, "glad to hear you're alright, beginning to be alright, about a day and a half - good luck"

We talk about our options again, and determine that both doors are seeped in magic and we could not dispel it to achieve our ends. Before we try going through the threshold again, [[Hugh]] mutters a quick prayer and we put the illusion paper into [[my hole]].  We all are exhausted traveling through again, our bodies aging and the room around us is entirely rotted and broken. We look around and the plaque by the shelf is falling off revealing a small amount of space behind it. There's another plaque falling on the wine shelf, and behind it is a goblin body. It's chest cavity is torn open but the heart is beating. They appear more arcane than religious. Behind the center of the table there's another goblin. White runes are drawn around both. 

[[Hugh]] tries to heal them, and heals us in the process. As the goblin in the center of the table gets healing, it's dies peacefully, torment over. The room immediately beings to deteriorate. We discuss a mercy kill for the last goblin, [[Rez]] and [[Costi]] look at the runes, they don't seem to be tainted, and seem clean - like they've been tended to. [[Hugh]] heals the last one, and the room begins to shake. The whole room starts to decay to the point, and the rug begins to devolve into the mud of the fingers zombies from before. We sprint through the door.
