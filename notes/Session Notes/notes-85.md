# Detailed Notes: Session 85

We begin by fighting - the leader wants to target [[Costi]] seemingly due to his connection to the [[The Raven Queen]]. [[Costi]] sees behind the veil and sees a skeletal figure that is interfering with our magic. 

vine out of mouth, watcher came out of portal, when skeleton came out of portal - who speak in elvish

[[Willow]]'s voice churns like rocks are in his throat and says "below the depths, roots of oldest anchor, aching, leaking, empty, bled for power" then later "the (four, form, sword, void, ford, forge) **touches** **together**/to gather, patch, **mend the tear** / mend them there, and set things right,  **anew no worse for wear** / numbers for where/ forbear" "when time is right, worlds align, veils are thin, strings will sing, and what will rise fights again".

The vine emerges out, slithers snakelike toward the portal, travels through it and into the portal. A blue rose grow from the top, that [[Willow]] plucks and gives to [[Hugh]].

[[Willow]] asks for a recap, and as we start to tell him, including telling him the pretty boy watcher is dead, he says he can't be because he can still see him! We see nothing in the corner where he points. As we talk, the portal begins to shimmer, and we panic asking if we should go through - he says yes! We grab the ring off the skeleton and run. We jump through. 

It is pitch black immediately, water faintly drips and a musky earthy smell is potent throughout the area. Those with dark vision see it's a tunnel, four dragon born corpses are freshly bleeding. They wear armor and weapons, two drow bodies are also their - four alive drow are there going through their bodies, though they've clearly gone through a fight. [[Jade]] immediately tries to negotiate in under common. They tell us to put our weapons down, as they begin binding [[Rez]], [[Costi]], and [[Freya]]. 

They ask us to explain our presence. [[Jade]] shares that she's Yuan-Ti. They ask why we are here, and we struggle to define what exactly happened. Their leader, [[Rhynilex Svenik]] want to know if we know who these bodies are. [[Jade]] is remarkably persuasive at showing that are also confused at how we got here. It seems like the bodies also just arrived? She also mentions "something from below the ground". They start to think perhaps we are aligned in our goals, and they'll kill us if they betray us. 

We are told we're in the outskirts of [[Izdeke]], [[Rhynilex Svenik]] seems to think [[Lloth]] might've delivered us here for a reason. She doesn't seem to know what the [[Southern Cities]]. We try to get more information, but they're very reticent to share. When we reach a junction of multiple tunnels, they blindsight those of us who can see as we walk for about an hour and a half. 

Eventually, we start to hear other voices, and [[Jade]] hears them argue about what to do with us. We're lead through a metal doorway, and someone provides a light. We're in a small metal room with [[Rhynilex Svenik]] and another drow named [[Amalyn]]. She says they will provide for our survival and come to get us in the coming days - [[Jade]] suggests they speak to us sooner, and it seems to hold some effect on her. 

[[Rez]] says increasingly crazy things to confirm [[Amalyn]] doesn't speak common. We take a short rest and recap what happened. [[Jade]] and [[Rez]] know good deal about anchor trees, they are in [[Dilandil]] and are tied to the fey - providing a great deal of magic to the [[Liveth forest]] and those that can tap that magic. 

We spend a lot of time trying to recap with [[Willow]] uttered, and attempting to make out those words. We talk a bit about [[Lloth]], and lie to [[Freya]] that this is what drow hotels are like -- we're definitely NOT in jail.

After a short rest, we hear screams outside before a large claw breaks through the wall and pulls [[Amalyn]] through the wall. She slides some keys our way, and we leave to try to help. After a smart polymorph by [[Costi]], we're able to subdue 2 chulls and an umberhulk who were have extra arms and eyes grafted onto them, and strange coloration. We're thanked and agree to self-arrest again until our chance to talk to [[the Matron]]. 

[[Rhynilex Svenik]] comes to escort us to [[the Matron]], leading us to an 8 sided building towards the center of town. We're lead into a throne room, where sitting on an 8-legged throne there is an older drow woman with elaborate plaits, she wears multiple pieces of jewelry with a sword at her side. 7 male drow stand behind her.

We're introduced and asked why we trespass, then brings out the dead dragonborn for all of us to see if we recognize them - none of us do. However they're all wearing [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]] garments. We explain what has happened to us, loosely talking about [[Corellon Larethian]] and [[Willow]], specifically highlighting [[Hugh]] and [[Costi]]'s visions - we say sorry for trespassing but also flag our problems may be intertwined. 

For the last few weeks, strange occurrences have happened in [[Izdeke]] - creatures that are altered or disfigured have made their way into town. Even when killed, their extra limbs continue to act and harm. They've also had patrols go missing, including [[The Matron]]'s favorite consort. They say they're underneath "one of the most powerful areas" called [[Weirefesteria]]. She believes something may be syphoning energy off of it for untoward means. [[Jade]] teases at some of our prophecy, which seems to spark a nod - they say the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]] dragonborn had a similar message found on them: 

"Below the depths, crews of oldest anchor, aching, peeking, empty bled for power. Core touches together, patch rend and tear, and set things right for you but worse for wear. In black of night, wills align, veils are thin, scales will harden, sun will rise, fight again"

[[Rez]] asks if we can talk to them, and they agree for tomorrow. We say we can ask some questions on their behalf. [[The Matron]], anemd [[Jhelen Svenik]], says if we help them, they'll let us live and see us safely to the surface. Her daughter will help us, pointing to [[Rhynilex Svenik]]. She says they believe the roots go "down", and encourages us to attempt to solve our own issues without harming any of their people. She shows us a slightly overlarge platinum dragon scale found on the [[Bahamut]] bodies, [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] looks at it, [[Freya]] detects a magical energy, or rather divine energy. SImilar to [[Hugh]]'s [[TrueSilver strand]], and the [[Blue Rose]] [[Hugh]] took from [[Corellon Larethian]].

[[Jade]] asks about [[Thalfar]], but it is too far away. [[Costi]] asks about undead, and they share that some are altered, and some are also undead. She says it was nothing abnormal, but [[Bagath Mizzragon]], her consort, went missing on 15 Hulfni. Some of the creatures bear strange marking, but none are anything specific, no symbols - just unnatural lines. They offer us quarters to stay in before we head below, and will return us our weapons. We can explore the city, if accompanied by [[Rhynilex Svenik]]. 

We ask for maps of their patrols, and hotspots where people went missing - they'll provide information. They've also had pools of strange corrosive liquid appearing through town, but they'd vanish after a time. They have samples, and will arrange for us to talk to those scholars. 

[[Rez]] also says if any other groups come through it could be good to talk to them first. They say they'll still attack if provoked, but understand the point. There is one other group that seems to still be at large, dwarven judging by their footsteps. We ask if [[Lloth]] has weighed in, and [[The Matron]] says she'll ask tonight. 

[[Hugh]] sends a message or [[TrueSilver]], [[Rez]] creating a small hearth for him, "Are the groups that are receiving messages like one we heard from [[Willow]] receiving the same message or conflicting messages that are counter to ours?"  We see on the surface of the log, four lines, all burning in the flame  - one green, one shining platinum, one yellow, one brown - that all converge on a much thinner quieter silver line. The four colored lines hit the silver thread and run in tandem for a couple of seconds, then diverge at the end. The platinum fading out, the three other diverging in different directions. 

[[Rez]] worries about the fact that [[Bahamut]] might have a different goal than [[Corellon Larethian]].
