# Detailed Notes: Session 116

We wake up to a sick sick camp, with 6 people dead. 27 wandered off, super high, and 6 of those came back... one is hung and the others are in the stockades.

[[Hugh|Finn]] tells [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] about [[Vask]]'s hijinks and [[Zalev]]. [[Rez]] owes him a sending it seems.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] puts on a performative investigation with [[Hugh|Finn]] to try and figure out HOW this poisoning could've possibly happened?? It sells.

[[Rez]] asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to chat with [[TrueSilver]]. He does a ritual and through the popping of flames:
* Do dragons need to help or protect [[Bahamut]], [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Pelor]]? YES
* Are the [[Wayfinders]] who wrote the notes in [[Kith and Kin]] trying to help [[Bahamut]], [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Pelor]]? I BELIEVE SO

[[Hugh|Finn]] also whispers a quiet question: Did you select me as your paragon like Adrienne?, [[TrueSilver]] replied, "Not like Adrienne, no. Like you. [[Hugh|Finn]]."

[[Costi]] gets the scheduled check-in from [[Tyros]], "scouting party captured by men in furs, alert us to changes in plan if any."

[[Rez]] sends to [[Vask]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] also casts sending to [[Willow]], who apparently lost his pants to a circle of mushrooms??

[[Fingers]] comes to check on us, taking stock of how we're all feeling, [[Hugh|Finn]] comes up with the nickname [[Adrienne Squirt]]. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is thrilled, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is totally indifferent, of course. 

They also tells us that the [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]] will be delayed, but they're trying to determine HOW the poisoning happened. [[Costi]] offers to examine the water, and goes off with [[Fingers]]. The interaction's weird. [[Fingers]] tries to ask about any internal romances, and he laughs about him and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], then gives the most round about answer, sorta inadvertently calling [[Rez]] a slut, but a popular one, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] either disinterested or a prude? It's confusing. Then gets so distracted by his ramblings, and subsequent embarrassment, he forgets the question "do you prefer [[Costi]] or [[Costi|Constantine]]"? If only the rest of us were there to see it.

He then gets to work trying to identify the poison, and does a good enough job that he then gets held up as an example above the soldiers working. 

When he gets back we talk about if it's worth planting evidence, and many of us are hesitant, though [[Costi]] is intrigued by his idea. 

[[Freya]] plans to send to [[Rawley]] "It’s Freya! Big news! I know things about the book like about dragons and gods and who needs help. Want to tell me the rest?" [[Rez]] enthusiastically agrees.  "I'm glad you've been making progress [[Freya]]. I'd love to share more. But you gotta get a little bit further on your own. Good luck." The next day she follows up - "Hi, it's me Freya. I also know things about [[Thelran Asari]] and it's son, and [[The Zumbinis]] and things that are missing. How about that?", he replies, "You're doing great, [[Freya]]. But you've got more to do, and this talk's better had in person. Got a few more months, study up".

A serious of slight misunderstandings leads to half of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] gently letting each other down romantically, leading to an especially confused [[Costi]] and a seductive [[Guu]].

[[Rez]] asks if [[Hugh|Finn]] can teach her how to talk to gods. It doesn't go how she's hoping. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]], "just checking in. How is compound? [[Marigold]]? Yourself?" He responds, "Quiet without you all. We’re just keeping trained up, hopefully won’t need to be deployed soon. Mari has a surprise for you when you’re back!"

[[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] go to spar, but it turns out [[Freya]] doesn't handle that well. She gets really mad. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is able to contain her, and tries to set some ground rules to prevent her from killing her in real life. [[Freya]]'s hesitant but with some convincing can see the benefit. It goes well for a while, and right as it seems like she's making progress, she flies into a rage and beats the shit out of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. 

It opens a can of worms for everyone to NOT admit to having unresolved trauma. 

On the last night, we're joined around our fire with [[Fingers]] and [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]]. We're told the next day will be the first scouting parties - we're going with [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]]. [[Colvia Ghul]] and [[Ignatz]] will be on different groups. We're going to look for entrances or weak spots into [[Golstrava]] - we may come back or we may camp out. [[Teld's Dogs]] are out on the hunt currently. We leave at dawn. 

As the night ends, [[Fingers]] gives [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] an opportunity, and she takes it. They have a great night. In the morning, [[Fingers]] takes a surprising little bit of a possessive stance, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] manages to talk her way out of it. [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] is intensely interested, but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] only reveals knives were used and it was a good time. 

We try to stealth our way to [[Golstrava]], scouting as we go. As we move through a section of particularly old growth trees, one of the large ones next to [[Freya]] begins to glow...
