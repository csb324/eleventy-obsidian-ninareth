# Detailed Notes: Session 147

We start to discuss the news, but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], our voice of reason, says we should probably make camp first. 

freya asks the curator if they've been listening and they answer yes. freya asks if they knew before the last couple of hours and they say yes

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] has lots of questions: about [[Rez's Family]] and the [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]], [[The Game]], and [[Rez]]'s time in [[Zalev]]. 

zmaj strode into the irvanhold, demanded an audience with the queen, and demanded assistance, proclaiming himself [[Rez's Dad|Azir]]'s descendant and a dragon. They gave him a small unit, and he's hunting zmaj and li maybe made it, it's tethered to our life force. 

E says Zalv is somewhere, needing space. They'll give him some space, then send someone to go find him. 

she's having a fling with Samson, he's a weird little thing but makes an impact. 

the secret island was almost ripped out of time and space, seemed like an alhoon - she told him some, he's been trying to research for a few weeks, but it turns out he doesn't read very well. 

we make plans to meet for the wayfinder convention 

adrienne and rez go on their watch, adrienne asks about the game, saying how many points charming some one was worth - Rez says that's not part of the game! Rez apologizes for not saving [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] when she had the chance, but adrienne is pretty unbothered, she says bringing her back to life is the kind of crazy idea that has Rez written all over it. Rez says Adrienne flirted with her too, and she didn't have any points to win. Adrienne decides that now that Rez's secret is out, it's not like anything serious could happen, so they might as well have fun. Rez agrees wholeheartedly. But Adrienne is too worried about our party's reactions, so they agree to keep it secret. Rezdrienne official begins. 

In the morning, [[Costi]] identifies the ring we found in the [[Zhakastin Expedition]], it's the [[Wolfskull Sage's Ring]].

We talk about trying to get the notes from [[Father Thronestone]], but remember [[Costi]] can get to [[Arkhosia (City)]], and he's in [[Jalantar]]. We decided we'll ask him to travel there himself and meet him there in a week or so. 

Discussing [[Colvia Ghul]], we agree to call her bluff and not tell her anything about the [[Freya's Mysterious Letter|Eye of the Everpresent]]. Weighing the pros and cons, we decide to use the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] teleportation circle to get back into [[Jezeten]].

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "[[Colvia Ghul]] is blackmailing. Thinking of using transportation circle to avoid. Lots to talk about before we see her. Thoughts? [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is out of it", she replies, "Sure, come in two hours and we can let you right out. We’ll find a reason for you to have gotten in."

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Li]], "[[Gu’athrithen]] sourcing fancy weapons - firegiant "[[G.T.]]", caches outside [[Deregheir]] border. Tooooooold you I should investigate the [[Turian Waste]]. Bunches of blues were eaten by [[Kaycee Teapetal|Rez's Mom]]'s [[The Shadowfell]] bog!", he replies, "[[Kaycee Teapetal|Kaycee]] made a bog on the [[Material Plane]]? She’s not supposed to do that… Location of cache? We’ll investigate. Good work." [[Rez]] sends those back to him. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] arrives back in [[Jezeten]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] send to [[Costi's mom]], "On our way home. [[Colvia Ghul]] MAY (will) trail us. Need to meet to explain everything. Maybe best to come to us? We’re alive. Sending love", she replied, "So glad you made it back. I’m sure asking why [[Colvia Ghul]] is tailing is long story. Should stay apart for couple days, will explain later."

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] and [[Trisha]] comes to greet us. [[Freya]] doesn't detect any magic or scrying eyes and says she'll provide us a cover story that happens to demote someone they don't like. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] explains what happened, [[Zormvrik]] working on some regenerating undead spell, pulled out the implement but removed the enchantment, able to lead us to a hole to the shadowfell where he'd been sourcing his undead, and we dealt with them, then [[Hugh|Finn]] dispelled it. It's clear that [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] sees we're holding some information back, it's somewhere in between 'I'm going to let this ride' and 'disappointment'. [[Rez]] says they think it might be tied to some of the other undead work they've been tracking, but don't know how. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] says [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] will want a full report. 

We discuss [[Colvia Ghul]], our work to find unlicensed necromancy from [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] in [[Viliki]]. We all agree he's clearly part of this larger network of necromantic experiments, working with the [[Eberronian Military]] but still unsanctioned. Key question: why not on the books?

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] asks what she wants, and we say information we're not sharing anywhere. We warned she'll probably get arrested, and they don't have the ability to help us get away with murder. 

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] says they're still weighing several options for the inciting event that will give us cover to [[A Murder of Dukes]]. Sienna says we can work through being in jail if we need to, but it's not ideal. If there's a small amount of information to satisfy [[Colvia Ghul]], and deal with it afterwards. 

We talk about who [[Colvia Ghul]] is as a person, that she'll be pursuing this knowledge with or without our help - but if she learns more before we can take care of her it could be a bigger problem. 

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] offers to let us stay there for a few days to figure out our response, we'll pretend [[Freya]] has 'sick sloughing' illness which can be caught in the [[Turian Waste]]. We'll use the cover of [[Costi]]'s menteeship to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]. He should be back in 3 days. 

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] says they expect the timing to our [[A Murder of Dukes]] is still a few weeks out. They want tensions to increase, to find the most bloodless path, and think they'll be able to talk down the likelihood of war with [[Gu’athrithen]] or [[Arkhosia]]. 

We give [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] the swords we found, keeping one in [[My Hole]]. We give 49 to the [[Bone Breakers]] and 50 to the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]], [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] pays us 2000 pp and 3000gp

She tells us to stay out of the Stone Ward and the Barracks. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks [[Dania]] for help with a few weapons. [[Hugh|Finn]] asks for an artificer to come help install his new hand. 

We each are assigned our own room, and [[Costi]] asks for his own room, sometimes.  

We head down to the basement to talk about what to tell [[Colvia Ghul]]
* Freya received a letter when she was kicked out of polaris with this 

[[Costi]] suggests we intentionally tell her we're withholding information as a safeguard so she doesn't kill us. We keep exploring, and keep sharing info, if we are free to do so. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Colvia Ghul]] to buy us a time, "Back in the city, ready to discuss further. Wastes FUCKED us up, at the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] compound. Give us few days!!"!, she responds, "Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon, we'll talk as soon as you can. I'll be waiting" 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] bribes [[Samuel]] not to share with our party anything about [[Rezdrienne]]'s new secret. It devolves into an extortion-therapy session. They both get what they're after. 

We chill.

[[Hugh|Finn]] scries on [[Zmaj]]. He's asleep in a barracks bed, he has his staff leaning against the bed beside him, some blood on it, but seemed restless. 

6 book checks

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] plays the harp, thinking of the gods being targeted here, she tries to "how does [[Ioun]] fit into the situation with the gods threatened" Sitting in the garden, playing, at the back of her mind, though she doesn't fully understand it, as it's indirectness mirrors the music, she can't stop thinking of [[Kith and Kin]]. 

[[Rez]] check in on [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]]:

* To [[Vask]] - Are you in [[Durmask]]? [[Kaycee Teapetal|Rez's Mom]] says hi. She SCOLDED me about the game, which is how I lost, but I'm sorry to scare you!! Okay? 
	* Landing there tomorrow! Sounds like the problem is largely taken care of for now, but it can’t hurt to break a few eggs. ALSO HI MOM!!!!!
* To [[Zmaj]] - Are you okay? [[Eirian|E]] told me about your big reveal. Save some heroics for the rest of us, will you?? You okay? Are they dead? 
	* Yes, they’re dead here. All we could find, anyway. I shouldn’t have waited so long, [[Zoheret]] would still be here. Planning our next move now.
* To [[Father Thronestone]] - Can you make your way to [[Arkhosia (City)]]? Say when you expect to arrive, I'll check in and we'll arrive that day. Too risky otherwise. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] scries on a few people:
* [[Vask]] - He's playing cards, [[Hugh|Finn]] sees him pretty obviously cheat, clearly egging on a conflict. It devolves into a bar fight, [[Vask]] pulls in others until it turns into a larger fight. Eventually he sits out, grinning and tracking the original guy that started fights. 

NOT THE FIRST NIGHT because she’s playing it so cool, but, the second night [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] messages [[Rez]] after everyone’s gone to bed and invites her over.

[[Hugh|Finn]] reaches out to a few people:
* To [[Noralin Brickview]]: checking in. I’ve just missing everyone and the warm of the hearth. Any updates? 
	* [[Hugh]]! It’s so good to hear from you. Things are great here, we have a few more followers. Will you be back soon?
	* Yes hopefully soon. I will sending when we are in bound. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] in tow
* To [[Jade]]: checking in. How goes your travels. Concise please. You have 25 words
	* [[Hugh]]! I have learned much, many secrets. Taken [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] as my lover. Killed great men. Tried new frosted dough, do you know of this? 

[[Hugh|Finn]] does a divination to [[TrueSilver]]: "How can we mislead [[Colvia Ghul]] best without revealing too much truth of the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]"
