# Detailed Notes: Session 151

[[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] discuss what to do with the information they just learned about [[The Curator]]. They try to think up lies to cover, different strategies to prevent the group from fighting, and end up drawing a bit of a blank. They land on kidnapping [[Costi]] to talk to him about what they learned with him privately. 

Meanwhile, [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]] have a heart to heart about the reality of [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] being back and active in this fight. [[Costi]] realizes he couldn't lose something he never had, but now it's an option. For the first time, [[Costi]] has reservations about this fight, yet feels compelled to stay. [[Hugh|Finn]] counsels him this is the right choice. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] tell [[Costi]], he has to immediately tell [[Samuel]]. They talk about how to manage the group dynamic. He seems confused. He doesn't remember being asked to look into [[The Curator]] at all... super weird. We say maybe he could talk to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] about it. 

That pivots to a number of things he wants to ask [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], including the 'real' history of the [[ELA]], why he hasn't even worked with them. We also mention needing real information on what they're planning from [[Niko]] and [[Zephyra]]. 

Walking out of our discussion, it's clear [[Samuel]] already forgot. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] talks about our plan for the day -- [[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] are going to do research, while [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] are going to try and track down our friends. [[Freya]] is craving a lazy day and decides to stay home. 

[[Rez]] sends to [[Giary]], "HEY GIARY - what are you doooooooing today? I mean, in general with the [[ELA]], but also today. Can we come hang?? Help?? I'll bring drinks!" he replies, "Yeah! [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] wanted us to find a good time, want to get lunch and plan? There's a cafe by our hotel, at (address), in the Lowground".

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] plays songs of thanks to [[Corellon Larethian]] for freeing [[Costi's Dad]]. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] asks [[TrueSilver]] "[[Costi]]'s goddess warned him about not being about to trust someone he should, do you know anything about that, is there a specific group?", there's no clear response. 

[[Dania]] answers [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]]'s summons, offers to take them to the library and to notify [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] that they have a question. None of the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] are home. [[Dania]] offers lunch, [[Hugh|Finn]] helps. 

At lunch, [[Niko]] says as far as they are aware, not being especially watched. He, and his group, say they only expect to be here about 2 weeks. Where they go next will depend on how everything goes down. 

We learn about what they did while we were apart. When [[Giary]] and crew found [[Niko]], he had been captured by the [[Zalev]]. They handled it. They went to [[Orzudan]], [[Niko]] with the goal of repaying [[Costi]]. 

[[Niko]] asks if we have heard with [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], we say he's well. He says there's a [[Plane of Earth Touched Sapphire]] he'd like to give him. They found it in a group of [[Eberron]] soldiers. Something seems a bit off though. 

[[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] wants to talk to us, tells us to go to [[AVAD]]tomorrow and head towards the tower of cards, a student will ask if we need help, then lead us where we can have an open conversation. A restricted section means we're being followed. 

[[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]]'s return has sped things up, they think we're going to be fully read in. [[Niko]] says he has a good feeling on [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], feels mostly good on the [[ELA]], but there's one plan with both high risk and reward he's nervous about. But he says it's more of an army than resistance group - they're well resourced, and well funded. 

It sounds like the gates are going to be a focus, create a vulnerability to dump resources and attention and draw man power away. They plan to hit many points simultaneously. They also want to take out someone high level. 9 days. 

Meanwhile, [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] joins [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]], bringing them for a chat in his study. [[Costi]] shares he wants information on their strategies, leadership, and tactics to see if any concern is warranted. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says he has people he trusts who will look into it. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] also warns that messages from [[The Raven Queen]] might not be relevant for a long time, as there aren't many opportunities for direct communication. He also counsels that maybe we should truly stop the [[ELA]]'s actions for our current task, that whatever they're doing isn't as important as what we're doing. 

[[Costi]] lets slip that [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] is back. He was part of the group freed in the [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]]. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s not surprised he wasn't told that. He agrees to do his best to try and keep both [[Costi's mom]] and [[Costi's Dad]] alive. 

He gives some tough love that we have to choose our priority, and killing the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] has to come first. 

[[Costi]] shares that [[Samuel]] seems to have a block around this undead creature, [[The Curator]]. He explains they are a collector of people, a desecrated creature, purposes unknown, who are willing to help us with some tasks. They have been involved with a lot of action. When [[Samuel]] was asked to look into them, he seems to have forgot, and then again immediately. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] asks if he's had direct contact, and [[Costi]] says yes once. He tells as much as he can - they wear a porcelain mask, seem to be exceptionally powerful, can entire people's minds. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says he has no awareness of this creature, which is atypical, and he'll look into it. [[Costi]] says when he fully devoted himself to [[The Raven Queen]], that [[The Curator]] was also there, but [[Samuel]] was not able to see him. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] seems concerned. 

Deciding to keep doubling down, they bring up the [[Curator Blue Marble]] and the real truth of what happened in [[Burbank Compound]]. They confirm [[Freya]] is involved, and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says he'd like to use her connection to learn more. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says they can try to learn if this is one of the undead that must be put down immediately, or one of the undead that can serve a purpose. They all share about the [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]] being the result of [[The Curator]] too. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says with their work helping free [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], it's a clear this could be useful until it's a problem. [[Costi]] shares that the [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]] would be good for us, [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says he believes [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] and the [[Bone Breakers]] believe they'll have [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] in custody in a few days. 

[[Costi]] warns that anything done in front of [[Freya]], potentially [[Rez]], could be potentially immediately heard/seen by [[The Curator]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] asks if [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] has heard anything, he said she hasn't brought it up to him. He'll ask. [[Costi]] warns not to underestimate them, they clearly want to remain a secret. 

They agree to talk in a few days, about what he learns on [[The Curator]] and to share more about the [[ELA]]'s plans. They'll frame a major in the [[Eberronian First Division]] of treason - [[Gorbulzhava]]. They'll try to help promote [[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]], the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] normally leaves those early. They share there's a tunnel under leading to the [[Palace Dharinov]], [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] is thrilled! How great!

There needs to be about a 36 hour heads up for [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] to tee off their plans, and the more we can overlap with the [[ELA]]'s distractions, the better. 

We share updates, and decide we should also try to reach out to [[Marius A]]. Maybe we can get drinks tomorrow. [[Rez]] sends, "Hiiiiii, it's Rez. We (and ~especially~ FREYA) would like to meet up for drinks? We'll be by AVAD to see Elena tomorrow, that work? FUN", he replies, "Sure! Itâ€™d be great to see friends. After dinner?"

[[Hugh|Finn]] sneaks [[Rez]] away to ask if she has any secrets about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], she plays coy. Asks if [[Hugh|Finn]] has seen anything, he says he saw she was jealous - [[Rez]] wants to know good jealous or bad jealous? [[Hugh|Finn]] doesn't know. They agree he'll keep an eye out next time. Then they pivot to drinking games. 

[[Freya]] checks in with [[Jade]], who confirms she's sleeping with [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]], she's fine. 

The next day, we head to [[AVAD]] to meet up with [[Costi's mom]] and [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]]. After some time, a student approaches us and asks if we need help with directions. 

We're met by [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]], two faculty, and the student enters in with us. We learn a bit about his background, he taught at the [[The Slavaadi College]] for a few decades, and then moved here and joined the cause. 

We learn about the [[ELA Day of Action]], that they have multiple attacks happening at once, with their less skilled, to divert away of getting their most dangerous in to kill a top target. Who will depend on access: the [[Jehneim Bastienev]], [[Teld]], [[Nacrissa Thrudec]], or [[Cliff Burbank]]. They hope this chaos and loss of infrastructure will lead to some devolution of their power. First, they'll clamp down, putting a lot of pressure on the general public (which while hard) will hopefully lead to broader uprisings. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] leads with a suggestion that tension between the [[Eberronian First Division]] and [[Eberronian Second Division]] could bring an opportunity, that targeting primarily the [[Eberronian Second Division]] would lead to infighting. They like the idea, and mention their agents in both armies they could use here. 

[[Costi]] gets a naturally good read on [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]], he seems remorseful, but more over he seems like an academic, caught on the theory of cause and reaction. 

Attacks:
* 7 days - In the catacombs under the stormwall district, there's a number of undead experiments and vampire spawn. The people from the buildings there keep them fed. They're exploring them currently, and looking at the option of releasing these creatures but ensuring they're funneled to specific points and drawing guards there. They plan to put several strong fighters there to contain any escapees.
	* They'd stage additional events, protests and property damage to draw the guards there
	* [[Jehneim Bastienev]] is leading the undead experiments
* ready - Attack guard outposts to cripple responses and draw military into the stormwall
* ready - Destroy two of the gates into the city 
	* Immediately leak to [[Slavaadi College]] the gates are down to draw attention and create real threat (they think they'd be able to repair them before the College arrives)
	* Draw the best to spend their time repairing these gates so that those who will be working within the city will be more aggressive
* ? - Kill the highest ranking member they can, sending [[Niko]] as a sniper. They're tracking their whole list of targets
* Calling in [[ELA]] forces from other areas, think their numbers will end up about 1,000 available fighters, 45 are of a high caliber. 
* Potentials:
	* evacuate building and then blow them up, leaving an area vulnerable to a storm
	* blocking or barricading some entrances to the barracks district to increase military response time

We ask if there's a particular day this has to happen, they're  worried the longer they wait, the more of them will die. They agree to try and let the timing be guided by us if we have another suggestion or plan in motion. They need at least a week. 

Before we leave, [[Costi]] undergoes some rough dental surgery to implant a [[cyanide tooth]], key word: tentacle.

We try to say hi to [[Costi's mom]], but she's not in. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] heads to meet [[Marius A]] for drinks. He's hoping to get assigned to a mission in [[Turian Waste]], based on his previous ability adapting to his time in [[Haag Kitot]] (several of his friends joined the ([[Devastators]]). 

He says he's only got a slap on the wrist for his work stopping the lynching in the streets, but doesn't want to talk about it much. He apologizes to [[Costi]] for the demonstration on [[AVAD]]'s campus right before we left: it was undeserved, but he tried to minimize the consequences the students faced. 

[[Freya]] tries to ask [[Marius A]] for pie recommendation. This loser doesn't eat pie!! They work through it though. 

[[Marius A]] says that things have been even more intense, and until the leader of the [[ELA]], who's been stoking up anger, is caught it won't get better. He thinks their threat has been overblown, that it's mostly foreign plants trying to weaken [[Eberron]]. 

His boss is [[Gorbulzhava]], but he doesn't have much interesting to say. 

[[Freya]] spends some time eating pie, then not eating pie with [[Marius A]]. 

The rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] spend some time talking about our ages, romances, and not thinking too hard about that. 

Down one member, on our walk home, [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] makes his appearance. He's on a 'personal' project, and he pulls us into a bar for a drink. Shockingly, he says he quit. He was given an ultimatum, be promoted or leave. When he couldn't negotiate to get military power to do his quest, he resigned.

Now, he's doing his work on his own - he's in [[Eberron]] searching for [[Niko]]. He's been the one 'responsible' for all of his biggest professional failures. He's been chasing him for years. 

[[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] says he's been working with [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] leans in on his pride, and [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] agrees but says he's more easy to work with when you can use it. He asks outright if we've seen [[Niko]], we say no. Giving us his address, he says any information we provide would go a long way to help alleviate any negative issues. We try to play a little, bluff, but he calls it out with some pretty clear threats. Fuck.
