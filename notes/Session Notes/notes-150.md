# Detailed Notes: Session 150

Over the four days, we do some scrying, shopping, and negotiate who is sleeping in which of the 3 rooms. Obviously [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]], [[Freya]] snores, so of course [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] decide to share. No other reason. 

We shop some, set up a normal personal use supply of incense, and work through the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] to get enough for one Legends Lore. We also get 4 potions of necrotic resistance.

[[Costi]] goes to talk to his [[Costi's mom]], they keep it light. When he asks if [[Marius A]] and [[Elena]]'s family has avoided trouble, she doesn't give a straight answer and avoids it. 

Looking for information on [[Oghma]], we learn she's one of the 6 [[True Gods]]: [[Tyr]], [[Torm]], [[Bane]] (LE) [[Beshaba]] (CE) [[Kelemvor]] who reigns over death in the realm [[Tayla]] (NN) and [[Oghma]] knowledge (L/NN). [[Oghma]] thought themselves above the primal petty conflict that created the planes and race. Created [[Mechanis]], of perfect precision and order. 

[[Ioun]] was the only one of [[Oghma]]'s devotees who ascended to godhood. Made 100 [[Ioun Stone]]s. [[Rivec]] was another notable follower of [[Oghma]]. The only place there is really a dedicated worship house is in the [[The Slavaadi College]].

We think through followers of the two gods:
* [[Oghma]]
	* [[Turgyd]] 
	* [[Professor Vendorsmere]]
	* [[Magister]]
* [[Ioun]]
	* [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]]
	* [[Colvia Ghul]]

We try to scry on [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] daily, the day before we get [[Zephyra]]'s note he fails - he sits and enjoys a meal with two people we don't recognize: a human-ish (he's got some dwarf in him) sergeant in [[Eberronian First Division]] and a plainclothes wood elf female in well made traveling clothes looks like a tracker, potentially a [[Game Warden]]. The seem to know each other, it seems friendly - like peers. It looks like a nice restaurant in the Commerce District potentially. 

We try [[Relakas]] and [[Tyros]]. They fight it off. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] refreshes our memory on [[Zephyra]] - she was with [[Giary]] and [[Terrav]] in the [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]], went to find [[Niko]]. 

We go to meet [[Zephyra]] in the Components District. The door to house we meet them at is locked and trapped. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sends to [[Zephyra]] who says it wasn't her idea. [[Rez]] sends [[Giary]] who says nooooooo he's not there. [[Costi]] ghostly gazes and finds a set of hollow rocks, each with a key. [[Hugh|Finn]] sees that one of the keys has the right shape to match the door. [[Rez]] is bummed it's that simple. At least, until [[Freya]] opens it. It's trapped. 

Inside, each door and room is progressive traps, though we disarm most of them. It's clear there's a caster that doesn't seem to fit any of the friends we expected. 

Finally, in the basement, a door opens to reveal a number of figures: [[Giary]], [[Niko]], [[Uru]], [[Zephyra]], [[Terrav]], [[Costi's mom]], [[Costi's Dad]]!!!!!!!!!!

[[Niko]] says he 'owed [[Costi]] one - [[Costi]] saved him, so he saved [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]'. When [[Costi]] asks 'how'? [[Giary]] final gets one over on him by polymorphing him into a dashaund. After a very public gloating, he throws [[Cost-puppy]] into the ground to revert him. 

At the point our friends were trying to figure out how to free him, there was a [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]] and his door just opened! He was escorted by a few people in guards uniform but in the pandemonium was able to escape. 

[[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] thanks [[Hugh|Finn]] for what he did, calling him his uncle. 

Halfling we don't recognize, older fellow, this was also a test of the facilities for this [[ELA]] safe house - he's [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]]. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] says hello to everyone, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Niko]] catch up, which [[Rez]] has no feelings about.

[[Giary]], [[Niko]], [[Zephyra]], [[Terrav]], and [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] leave us to catch up and say they have work to do tonight. [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] seems to be leading [[ELA]] activity in [[Jezeten]].

[[Costi's mom]] warns that [[Nadia]] doesn't know about [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], and can't. We finally get his side of the story:

He was imprisoned for some time, at first in a different work camp. He was there for a few years after [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]] put him there for disobeying orders. He found a friendly face in the prison who oversaw the camp, and let [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] out early for good behavior. This angered [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]], so he was quickly redrafted. He was canon fodder, getting arrested might've honestly saved his life - so he committed a careful crime, not get hung but to get off the frontlines for a long time. He'd hoped for somewhere other than [[Orzudan]], but wasn't that lucky. It's even worse than the rumors. 

A month and a half ago his door opened. A few others tried to escape with him, but he was the only one who made it to freedom. They've been traveling to [[Jezeten]] ever since, and just arrived. 

[[Costi]] asks where [[Samuel]] came from, and [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] says he'd prefer to talk to him about that in private. He asks to see [[Raven's Edge]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] asks how the memory was implanted in his head, [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] says he prayed to [[The Raven Queen]], and sometimes it works. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] shares that [[Costi]] is a junior ambassador under [[Cliff Burbank]], [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] says he got the sense he was trying his best. Plus, it might be good for [[Costi]] to be close to him. Especially for what the [[ELA]] is planning. 

A larger attack is in the works, there's a number of garrisons they're hoping to eliminate, throw the city into chaos, kill nobles, and well. They won't tell us the rest. We warn them about [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]], and they say he won't leave [[Eberron]] alive. 

[[Rez]] also warns [[Zephyra]], "Hey!! You left so quick, didn't even catch up. ANYWAY [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] is HERE in [[Jezeten]] but ~secretly~ no uniform -- Commerce District. [[Relakas]] with [[Eberronian First Division]]. BAD", she replies, "Fuck"

We spend some time telling all sorts of stories, heroic, embarrassing, and everything in between about [[Costi]] to [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]]. 

[[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] pulls all of aside to give [[Costi]] a moment, tells us she had no idea this was coming, but maybe they can be a family again. Then she shows us on a map the locations of a few more safe houses. 

[[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] tells [[Costi]] that when he left, he had a thought that he might not come back - so he asked [[The Raven Queen]] for help. To make sure someone would take care of [[Costi]], and [[Raven's Edge]] was there when he awoke, along with [[Samuel]]. [[Costi]] asks how he shows his affiliation, and [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] says he tries to act our her will: saving who can be saved, destroying what needs to be destroyed, stopping people from being turned. 

[[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] says the last time he spoke directly to [[The Raven Queen]] was when he gave [[Hugh|Finn]] that memory. He doesn't know what happens, sometimes he gets lucky. He talks with [[Costi]] about his military service, and [[Costi]] shares that he wishes he didn't come back. [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] is proud he did, but wishes that too. They share a sweet moment. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] spends a few moments alone with [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] too. He apologizes, that he spent time away, when he could've been helping. He also thanks him, since he's not sure he ever would've left without him. It's all fun and games, but stop making moves on his woman. 

[[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] tells us he's going to be smuggling out of [[Jezeten]] tonight but hopes to see [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] again soon. We all say goodbyes. 

We talk about how [[Costi]] feels now. He's happy but now he's scared, since his dad could be at risk. It turns into a question of how he was freed, and if it was [[The Curator]]'s choice intentionally to release him.

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], "It's [[Rez]]! [[Costi]]'s friend! Hope I'm not interrupting, do you remember what cell number in [[Orzudan]] you were in? Or who was in cell 47?", he replies, "Iâ€™ll never forget. Cell 37. I think 47 was [[Dobosta Cumunzal]], a real freak. Did he make it out, too?"
