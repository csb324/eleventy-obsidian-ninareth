# Detailed Notes: Session 119

We prepare for the invasion. [[Rez]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] talk about the need to 'see' something tying to leadership that allows us to go find the item the [[ELA]] tasked us recover. 

[[Costi]] sends to [[Tyros]], "Can you help distract or incapacitate [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]]? Easier to keep our cover than murder. Entering the city in x minutes", he replies "it has already been taken care of, your job is to find the building. Everything will solve itself".

[[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] casts pass without a trace and we head into [[Golstrava]]. As soon as we step into the graveyard explosions go off all around the town, and with an alarm bell, some sort of bolts begin shooting out to the edges of town. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] can immediately sense that undead are beneath us, barely under the surface. The undead begin to rise, and then attack.

Looking through the Death House, there's two fresh [[ELA]] corpses - seems like they tried to run but got caught by their own vampire. We get some healing potions, and finds instructions on how to free the undead. She uses a sending stone to report in. Looking at a map they head, there's some marks (grave yard, marshes, the central pile of sticks). 

[[Rez]], hearing screams from the mausoleum goes to investigate, but gets caught in an mental prison and sees horrific visions - taking a ton of psychic damage. [[Freya]] comes to the rescue. She seems to get caught in a memory of the husks of burned bodies there, tied to stakes, screaming on fire, with the fear of an ancient red dragon coming to burn them alive. The memories of [[Golstrava]] are not nice. Despite getting pulled out, something seems to be holding on.

Brushing off the group's concern, we start to head into the city, searching for our target building. Walking past the center of town, [[Rez]] gets pulled back into the memories again, seeing the dozens of people being sacrificed, and some element of blood magic involved too. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] confirms that it is extremely desecrated. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] tries to pull [[Rez]] out of it and reassure her, but notice that at least we've found ourselves on the right street for our target building. 

As we approach the building, [[Hugh|Finn]] sees 5 hidden [[ELA]] soldiers. We fight, take one captive and stash him in an abandoned building. As the fight ends, [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] gets a sending stone out and says that she's needed somewhere else, as a magical tracker. Tells us to write on the wall what direction we head: abcd / nesw. Then she heads out.

When we approach the target building, [[Costi]] casts ghostly gaze to find the illusory wall. We see that within a cask against a back wall. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes into the bunks, keeping everyone as close as possible. [[Costi]] [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] go to the cellar door to point out the entrance. Deciding to keep our liars on the front of this, [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] go through the threshold, and find a room. There's a figure in the center of the room, [[Sinkerk]] and with extreme urgency calls the rest of us here. 

He gives [[Rez]] 3 scrolls of modify memory
box 5 switches, activate major explosions across the city as well as within the caravans to bring back, and the wounded in the camp. found it, we saved the day.
a map, of three more ela camps scattered across the city.
teld approached [[Devkorus Kaa|Dev]] location
he tells everyone other than rez to look at a wall, and grabs rez saying "so much depends on you all, i have faith in you"

a voice in the door, appearing from the ether, a large hairy man. I knew you were up to no good, [[Lukan]], and [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]]. He says he's been following us for days. 5 other figures, heavy with furs, step in. [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] says "I trusted you".
