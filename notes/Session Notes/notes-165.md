# Session 165

[[Costi]] is going to spend some time trying to understand the [[Amulet of the Planes]] from the undead mummy. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sits down to catch up with [[Magister]]. He asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to share about his reprogramming process. His memories or experiences were augmented at some point with a token of [[Bane]]. [[Magister]] wanted to know where it was attached, but it was too blurry for [[Hugh|Finn]]. They also discuss the creation of [[SVN models]] - they were an early experiment with warforged. [[Nedelev]] was an accomplished necromancer before he became a tinkerer and artificier. He thought combining the souls of the living with his creations would give them additional power, though his notes are now mostly missing. All the [[SVN models]] seem to have the same blurry remembrance of their creations. [[Magister]] is a [[TNR 18 model]], though he does not like to identify as such. 

[[Magister]] gives [[Hugh|Finn]] the nudge to prioritize his relationship with himself, and recognize relationships with biologics will always be fleeting. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Aedara Alinar|Auntie A]], "Hiiii!! Guess what we found?? A [[Shard of Maguebliet]]! Some mummy guy had it? We're taking it to the [[Niraani Sisterhood]]. Just seems like something you'd care about, if you want it! Also never mind, I got my person back, she's fine now. Oh ALSO, have you heard from [[Azir DarAxia|Rez's Dad]]?" She replies, "Disturbing, didn't know mummy with [[Shard of Maguebliet]], but [[Niraani Sisterhood]] should have it. See it safely there. Have [[Zmaj]] investigate, please, and tell [[Li]]. Glad person is fine. No, haven't spoken to [[Rez's Dad|Azir]] in...some time. Unclear how much. Is there reason to be concerned? If so, can investigate further.", [[Rez]] continues, "I mean, I'm sure he's fine, it's DAD. It's just NO ONE has in a few decades? I want to tell him there's some people targeting us. They killed [[Nehushta|Neti]] and [[Zoheret|Zoha]]. We're handling that soon though!! And [[Bahamut]] maybe needs help? But we're also totally handling that. I think." After a long pauses [[Aedara Alinar|Aedara]] responds, "Thank **you** for telling me [[Rez]], I appreciate it. This is concerning, and I'll be speaking to the others."

[[Rez]] picks up that her tone was both surprised, and the most concerned she's been in a while. It seems like she maybe got [[Zmaj]] in trouble. 

[[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] catch up too. [[The Silver Halves]] were commissioned to go deep into the [[Turian Waste]], a high elven tomb, where a [[Shard of Maguebliet]]. It seems like the tomb was more recent, about 60 or 70 years before the fall of [[Gu’athrithen]]. Someone in [[Thelran Asari]] requested they track it down. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] shares that in our own adventure in the [[Turian Waste]], there was some goblin influence mixed in with the undead. It's noteworthy, because goblins are by and large conscripted into their endless war within [[The Abyss]]. 

The discuss the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]], which is noteworthy because you get people familiar with every distinct part of [[Ninarith]] - which is especially important for adventures knowledge gaining. 

[[Victoria Several|Victoria]] asks if they can be helpful in our quest to see [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] elected [[Duke Burbank]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] shares a bit about our recent politicking, but does allude to a mis-perception of a lack of trade future under his leadership, and she's happy to spend some gold and spread a bit of rumors around her involvement. [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] asks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to set up a meeting with [[Trisha]] or [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] plus [[Vask]] go out for a night of fun. We invite [[Dania]] and [[Fingers]] too. [[Dania]], once again, has too much work, but continues to promise before he leaves. [[Fingers]] is coming though ([[Hugh|Finn]]'s worst outcome). [[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "Any chance you can let [[Dania]] out of work tonight? I really need her out tonight. This group is a lot", she responds, "I understand dear, but you’ve given us a lot of work to do with the dropouts. You can celebrate with her at the inauguration."

[[Rez]] and [[Vask]] both try to tune their respective instruments (a mandolin and lute), it's a form of torture for [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. And despite all signs otherwise, once they get on stage, their sheer charisma takes the "two-string method" into a fun show, and gets the whole bar dancing.

[[Freya]] pitches revenge-pooping to [[Vask]], mixed into their bathtub liquor. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] lets [[Freya]] take the lead. She goads [[Vask]] by acting like she thinks he can't handle it. He downs it, bottoms up. 

[[Vask]] teases [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] into accidentally revealing a touch too much about her feelings for [[Rez]], and of all people, [[Costi]] is the one to fully clock it. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tells him to shut up, [[Costi]] says nothing, but his smirk is enough. [[Hugh|Finn]] gets in on it, and they both try to pressure [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] into saying more. They make a pitch on why [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] should all care about this, but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to deflect. 

[[Freya]] keeps up the pressure, and somehow [[Vask]] and [[Rez]] get into a drinking contest with her bootleg alcohol. Uh-oh. So far it's fine. 

Eventually the liquor catches up to [[Rez]] first, who pulls [[Freya]] in an then oops pukes all over her. [[Vask]] is hit only a few moments later, but then much worse. [[Freya]] notices this, tries to keep him there, so he shoots her in the stomach. He runs away. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] convinces a very drunk [[Rez]] to head back. [[Rez]] will do whatever she says, so that works fine. They have a very muddy somewhat tense feelings chat - [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] shares that [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] party knows. And also, maybe they shouldn't be roommates in [[Thelran Asari]]. She called it a "potentially unsustainable dynamic", what if someone finds out and uses it against them? [[Rez]] says she doesn't care if people find out. And plus, she can still just sneak over, she likes sneaking around. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is thrown off kilter, and says sure, but then also pushes back that she doesn't want this to be "a thing". [[Rez]] doesn't know what that means, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] doesn't want to tell her. [[Rez]] says she'll just draw her own conclusions then. It's messy and doesn't seem to land anywhere in particular. Classic. 

The rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] stays out, [[Vask]] returning for another song, translating his physical pain into a beautiful emotional pain filled ballad. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendingts to [[Vask]], "good luck", he replies, "Tell [[Freya]] to spend the next two years sleeping with both eyes open. This is war."

[[Freya]] meanwhile, goes to the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] with [[Fingers]]. After, [[Freya]] asks about her longer term plans, she thinks she'll say close to [[Jezeten]], but there's a lot in the air. [[Freya]] tries to get her to open up, she does a little - when she was younger, she lost a few things that were very important to her to some people she didn't have a way to get back at. Since then, she has thought about much else than getting back at them. She's made some progress with the help of [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], and doesn't let herself think much beyond that. [[Freya]] understands, that feeling of revenge is too big inside of her too. [[Fingers]] offers to be helpful if [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] needs anything with whatever we're doing that draws us to [[Eberron]], even beyond [[Costi]] and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s efforts. 

[[Costi]] brings a drunken [[Hugh|Finn]] home, who wakes [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to help him. She does. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sends a note to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] and [[Trisha]], introducing them to our good friend [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and who is excited about everything they've been up to lately. She directs them to where their staying to communicate arrangements. 

[[Freya]] tells [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] about the prank to [[Vask]], [[Rez]] is delighted, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is avenged. [[Rez]] hires someone to publicly keep dropping off "helpful" items every hour. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] wants to go shopping, [[Rez]] joins. [[Hugh|Finn]] gets some random goodies, [[Rez]] gets two items to shit on [[Zmaj]] - a tapestry titled "Do Better" with a dark hair wood elf guard scolding another, and a mug that says "World's Best Assistant Guard". Perfect. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Rez]] have a bit of a heart to heart, in particular about their vastly different experiences with immortality. [[Hugh|Finn]] is worried about it. [[Rez]] counters that immortality is fun, if shared with others. [[Rez]] tells [[Hugh|Finn]] he doesn't have to STOP caring about mortals, he's just got to have family who aren't mortals too. [[Hugh|Finn]] shares that he's new to knowing the experience of mortality, given how his lives were segmented before his reconstruction. He tries to help [[Rez]] with her grief, but she's come to share her anger with denial -- she'd feel worse if she hadn't heard [[Gin]] still in the [[Weird Boulder]], but she feels better knowing that [[Nehushta|Neti]] and [[Zoheret|Zoha]] aren't DEAD dead, because dragon's live forever. She just has to figure out how to get them out of those rocks. [[Rez]] is angry though, and ready to kill all the [[Boulder Makers]] who have dared to hurt them. [[Hugh|Finn]] shares a bit about his familiarity with grief, [[Rez]] super clumsily agrees that she's coming to learn a bit more about it being sad when mortals die too, now that she's around them more. But that's what mortals do, it's just part of it. [[Hugh|Finn]] asks [[Rez]] to see a bit more like him, and she agrees - but only if he'll do the same. 

[[Freya]], [[Costi]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talk through what [[Freya]]'s learned about [[Fingers]]. [[Costi]] asks if [[Freya]] LIKES [[Fingers]] - she's not sure if she can. She says hook ups are easier, they don't have any feelings or complications. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] agrees. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] then shames [[Costi]] for getting up in her business, and [[Freya]] makes sure it's not her, right? But it's all through subtext and [[Costi]] decides to call her bluff - telling [[Freya]] that [[Rezdrienne]] is some sorta thing. [[Freya]] POUNCES. They push [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to share if she has feelings, shocking no one, it doesn't get far. She does confirm they are not exclusive. They're shocked [[Rez]] hasn't [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] told, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] says she asked her not to. The keep trying to crack [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], saying they both shared and what some reciprocation, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] opens a tiiiiny bit to say she doesn't know what she could say that would dissuade them that isn't mean to [[Rez]] - they keep hounding for clarity. 

She admits that she doesn't have a lot of friends from her past, or family she's close to - it's hard for her to talk about her feelings. It's her business and is defensive on why anyone else would want to know. She's not used to anyone care for anything other than malicious reasons. They're sorry about that, and understand a bit more. But they try to normalize talking about things for her. 

We catch each other up on what we learned from [[The Silver Halves]], and [[Costi]] looks at the [[Amulet of the Planes]], interestingly, some of the symbols on it were added later than the original runes and sigils. Someone carved a cloaking charm onto it to mask a decent amount of what it can do. [[Hugh|Finn]] dispels it. 

It's a [[Amulet of the Planes]] that is tied to [[The Shadowfell]]. 

Over the next few days, we get our clothes from the [[Winterseekers]], each with an outfit for the inauguration. Most of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes to have dinner with [[Aaeron Coldseeker]], [[Costi]] pitches [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] - he says that his last memory of [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]] was coming out of the conversation with [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] looking shaken. He agrees pretty readily to support [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], saying that he doesn't want to go back to status quo. We're haunted.

[[Costi]] sends to [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]], "If you have any voting members connections, [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] is the best choice", he replies, "Ehmmmmmmmm, we were leaning accelerationism, but no on - you're right. You earned it. 5 more votes".

The day of voting comes, and we now can officially say [[Duke Burbank]]!!!! 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Dania]], "We heard the good news! Where should we be?", she replies, "tonight, celebrating with just the family. Tomorrow we'll have details, be broadly available" [[Rez]] sends to [[Trisha]], "TRISHA YAYYYYYYY You did it and we did it and now your dad is DUKE!! The BEST feeling is a loooooong scheme that WINS. Celebrate!", she replies, "Thank you, dear, we feel great. We’ll see you tomorrow, come by around 1:00!"

We spend our last night as just [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] quietly at home. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] play chess. [[Rez]] helps teach [[Costi]] how to use his wings.

[[Costi]] sends to [[Henrik]], "You probably know, [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] - new duke! I'm excited! If you need connection, please tell me this could be big for [[Eberron]]. Yay!" he replies, "You broke the news, exciting. I've met the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], a reintroduction couldn't hurt. Mind if I ask [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]? Mending that fence" [[Costi]] responds, "Oh DUH of course!! [[Costi]]'s stupid. Yea, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] - do that. Sounds great hope [[Arkhosia (City)]] good" [[Henrik]] "Good man thanks costi"

Adrienne gets a sending from [[Henrik]], "[[Costi]] told me about [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], congrats. Mind making an intro? Obviously know him, but tense. Friendly introduction helpful", she replies, "What did you do to them? Sure. Hope things are well." [[Henrik]] sends again, "Are nations are at war [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], our personal relationship is fine but politically it's complicated. You brokering meeting would help." [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] ends with "Fine."

That evening [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] hurts her own feelings planning a mental goodbye herself to [[Rez]] and [[Rezdrienne]]. [[Rez]] does not get the message. 

the next friends and family event with all the folks from [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] camp, and the dropped out other candidates. It's a pre-coronation party, the main event is at sunset, and the afterparty will be at the [[Duchal District]] in the palace. 

[[Colvia Ghul]] comes down from the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], she'll still be supporting as from [[Duke v'Luthei]], for now, from the intelligence agency, [[Nakhodiztka]]. She will be the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] new Chamberlain. We will have a brief chat tonight and can talk more in [[Thelran Asari]]. She still plans to go to the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]], her first time. 

Right before the coronation, the [[Groups and Organizations/Burbanks|Burbanks]] join the party. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] gives short remarks, and leads the group towards the event. [[Costi]] sings the [[Eberron]] national anthem for the first time with an active choice to focus on the future. 

On stage, [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] are joined by [[Colvia Ghul]], city manager [[Klodec Hyemagu]], a representative from the [[Eberronian Third Division]], [[Fingers]] dressed as Colonel of the [[Eberronian Second Division]], and [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]] of the [[Eberronian First Division]]. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] gives a speech, pledging safety for all [[Eberron]] men, women, and children. To pull together and build the bonds between all people. He addresses the [[Stormwall district]], and promises investigations, cautioning avoiding parts of the area, where 'foreign agents' might've created hazardous conditions. There's a hysterically awkwardly long 5 minutes of remembrance for [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. He ends with a promise to remember the trust the people of [[Jezeten]] have put in him. There's a minor blood ritual and then he is introduced as [[Duke v'Dharinov]].

In the crowd, [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] and [[Starstool Daygrip]] are here. So are [[The Silver Halves]]. [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] too. 

We circulate around the after party. 
* We bump [[Colvia Ghul]] to [[Thelran Asari]].
* [[Marius A]] took the transfer and is now in the [[Eberronian Second Division]], and [[Vragar Aldea]] is now head of the guard. 
* [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]] is the Commerce Chair. We learn that [[Deregheir]] bought the [[Tiamat Scale]]. 
* [[Rez]] points out [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] to [[Vask]]. 
* The [[Made Fors]] are getting moved to the guard, [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] wants to give his folks a break, the story is the strongest are needed to ensure safety
* [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] plays it cool, he will stay on the trail for [[Niko]], thinks it leads to [[New Fairhaven]] 
* [[Elena]] wants to tour [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]] and visit [[Costi]]

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] has a moment with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. He says she has the tendency to bet on the right horse, she's 2 for 2. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] alludes to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s connection to [[The Raven Queen]]. He drops that the seems to be a potential limited ban on the use of undead within [[Jezeten]]'s walls, though [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] floats several ways to use it against [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] - and also [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] for our roles in investigating the tunnels. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] counsels [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to talk to everyone at the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]], you never know which conversation will pay off. Says [[Tinkate]] and [[Thelran Asari]] used to be the powerhouses within the [[Wayfinders]]. 

During that [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] talk about the trauma that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] must be bottling up due to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], especially when [[Costi]] was so impacted from just a short time with him. [[Rez]] tries to get a better understanding of how to talk about these things with people, [[Costi]] recommends opening up more. [[Rez]] says she thinks she wants to chip away at [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and piece together the puzzle of her from each of those little bits she can get without raising her defenses. [[Costi]] says he's going to asl [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] for advice.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes to see the [[Groups and Organizations/Burbanks|Burbanks]] Family. He thanks us, stating that he would not be where he is now without our work. We talk about the future of [[Eberron]] on the whole. They say [[New Fairhaven]] is less defended, and we have to be there in the near future regardless. They confirmed [[Von]]'s exist, but are working on slowly gaining information on him and the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]. [[Costi]] thanks [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] for restoring his pride in his country. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] reintroduces [[Henrik]], [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] tells her to send a formal letter. [[Trisha]] says she'll join us in [[Thelran Asari]] in a few weeks. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] takes [[Costi]] to see a teleportation circle in the Duchal palace.

[[Hugh|Finn]] takes [[Dania]] to meet [[Magister]]. After an introduction, and quick chat. [[Dania]] leads [[Hugh|Finn]] to the personal family gardens for a quiet spot to chat. [[Dania]] was in the [[Eberronian Second Division]], and suffered some damage that permanently removed her martial capabilities. She was due to be decommissioned, but [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] hired her instead. That was 38 years ago. [[Hugh|Finn]] gives [[Dania]] the book cozy he made for her notebook. [[Dania]] confirms if [[Costi]] treats [[Hugh|Finn]] well, [[Hugh|Finn]] confirms that he is as close as he has to family. They both share the understanding of gratitude towards the families that saved them. They share a sweet moment, and a kiss, before [[Dania]] wants to check on [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] again. They plan to meet up in an hour. 

Before bed, [[Rez]] asks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] a bit more about her feelings now on [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. She wants him to no longer have power over her or [[Adrienne's Family]], and other he could harm in general too. Dead or deeply shamed and embarrassed - doesn't particularly matter. [[Rez]] asks if she'd change choosing to work for him if she could, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] easily says yes. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was younger than [[Costi]] now when she started working for him. [[Rez]] makes it clear she just wanted to know. 

The next morning, we make our way to [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]'s airship. We are officially leaving [[Jezeten]] behind. 

Over the journey, [[Rez]] begins her understand [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] project, and is able to ask a number of questions without raising her defenses too fast. They spend a fair amount of time talking. 

[[Costi]] bets [[Vask]] that he can polymorph himself faster than he can be shot, [[Costi]] uses contingency and wins, but [[Vask]]'s bullet immediately knocks him out of concentration. [[Vask]] throws him the 100gp he won, but a bump in the airship, combined with [[Costi]]'s slow reflexes sends it's flying over the rails. Oops. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Magister]] have a lot of deep philosophical debates, they have some fundamental differences but agree more than they disagree. He still has a lot of bitterness to biologics - he respects [[Victoria Several|Victoria]], thought not every [[Several]] treated him well. Along with many other humanoids. 

[[Magister]] asks about [[Vask]] and [[Victoria Several|Victoria]], he scoffs, then says he's a talented sharpshooter, shockingly well-connected, and even fun to be around, but is not romantically engaged with [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]. Even if he wants it, it will stay that way. [[Magister]] describes how [[Vask]] joined [[The Silver Halves]], he came up and flirted with [[Victoria Several|Victoria]], she humored him, then he handily murdered some would-be thieves. 

[[Magister]] won't share who commissioned [[The Silver Halves]] to find the [[Shard of Maguebliet]], *she* paid extra for that privacy.

[[Freya]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]] to [[Rawley]], "Quick questions. Is there a list of people who will be at convention? Can I have it? One last chance to give me details before", he replies, "Yes but the attendance list is longer than 25 words, get it at check-in. See ya there darling"

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Vask]] have a too tense exchange of insults, [[Freya]] offers to help kill him, [[Costi]] suggests outing him is worse. He tries to apologize with a bottle of wine on her bed later. 

[[Vask]] and [[Rez]] catch up, he asks about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] - [[Rez]] shares that she's just so interesting. And he should hear her play the harp. But if he asked anything about her, [[Rez]] likely couldn't even answer. She wants to though. They talk a bit about their past experiences, [[Vask]] also like his beautiful enigma of [[Victoria Several|Victoria]], but they haven't even kissed. He thinks his secret is fine from [[The Silver Halves]], he hasn't dropped as many hints and no one has called him on it. They also talk about the difference of spending this much time with mortals. It's different than they both thought it would be. Busier, and more interesting, and very intense and fun. [[Rez]] learns they're in the books about the [[The Zumbinis]].  

Both of our parties get together for dinner. [[Magister]] helps give [[Freya]] some information from his past experiences with [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]]s, there's great panels, huge parties, trainings, and lots of networkings. She's reminded of her speech and it spirals her a little bit.

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Akros]], "Hello, on behalf of [[Freya]], what is her speech at the convention supposed to be about?", [[Akros]] replies, "oh, they didn't tell her? Wayfinding, what it means to her, what she's learned. Normally, circumnavigation after decades, so unique situation"

[[Magister]] suggests we back date some contracts, pay her some money, and if she walks in with some significant work and funds it would strongly benefit her position. [[Freya]] wants to know why she should better her standing, and we remind her of the benefits of the group that she could take advantage of. Plus, she could get in trouble if she doesn't show her success. [[Freya]] is deeply stressed. 

[[Victoria Several|Victoria]] met [[Colvia Ghul]], says she seems like a curious and powerful woman - they talked about future work together. We tell her to be careful, she's not worried and claims to be practiced in keeping her information hidden. 

[[Freya]] talks about the planes and asks [[The Silver Halves]] if they've traveled to others. They've been to the [[Plane of Fire]]. We ask if they know a fire giant with the initials [[G.T.]] - they say [[Gaulthidak Thramaal]] is known for well forged magical weapons. They don't know anything else. 

We buy the [[Amulet of the Planes]] from them. They refuse to say more about the [[Shard of Maguebliet]], and that it will be delivered to who commissioned it. When [[Rez]] worries it was supposed to go to the [[Niraani Sisterhood]], they won't say more but [[Vask]] winks. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Dania]], "Hello, I know we just left but since I have extra spells I thought I’d ask how your day went?" she replies, "It was lovely! First day as the [[Duke v'Luthei]]’s master of the treasury. I didn’t realize that was my role! Yours?" he replies, "Congratulations! can’t think of a better choice. Travel mostly. Tea with [[Magister]]. Lively discussion about religion. I’ll send tomorrow if I have spells. Chat soon", she responds, "That sounds so lovely! I’m glad you’re having a nice time, and please do."

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks [[Vask]] to share the bottle of wine he apologized to her with. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] clarifies that she and [[Rez]] aren't sleeping together anymore, [[Vask]] is immediately like "I just talked to [[Rez]] and she went on and on about pretty and interesting and talented you were" and more over she didn't seem to know. [[Vask]] says that he and [[Rez]] both sometime hear what they want to hear, and if they pretend that is what they heard, then sometimes they can make it true. 

They briefly divert to their secrets. He offers her 75 gp for every person [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] exceptions from [[The Game]] but not for [[Eirian]]. 

[[Vask]] tries to convince [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to pretend they slept together, but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] shoots him down. She does consider it though. She tries to make him convinced to hide that they talked, but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] just can't quite manage it. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes to sit on the deck and admire the stars, we chat about [[Thelran Asari]] and [[Costi]] thanks [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] for helping him achieve his life's mission. In the midst of that sweet moment, [[Hugh|Finn]] spots approaching us two bats? Nope, it's fucking [[Ramara]] and [[Davis]] [[Vincenda]]. The say "to move because they're going down there or through you", [[Rez]] says "you can fucking try".
