# Session 163

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "A request. All personal effects from the hanged ela, Would I be able to get those? Specifically the black haired human. Come up with whatever you need.", she replies, "Of course, that can easily be done."

[[Rez]] makes a dragon engraved ring, with the help of [[Hugh|Finn]]. 

[[Freya]] goes on a journey to acquire some lendeth-like liquor. She finds something not yet tested to be safe for humanoids... At [[Rosepetal's]] from [[Corpher Rosepetal]] himself.

[[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] get a 'double date' set up with [[Trisha]] and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] at [[The Outpost]]. [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] says some of [[Dobosta Cumunzal]]'s undead maintained magical energy, including have necromancy themselves. He should be executed in five days time. [[Marius A]] has been boosting the odds of [[Vragar Aldea]], given his unique role as sole survivor of the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] ordeal. But the institution is backing [[Sylgeiros Crimsonmane]], which would be terrible. They did have an idea for [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], that if [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]]'s reputation could take a significant hit they might drop out. He's been making some concerning statements about 'compromising' to secure power. He's a successful merchant, has lots of vices and is calculating. [[Vragar Aldea]] has not 'always be faithful', and they have a loss of standing handled. 

[[Trisha]] says she's got a very weird feeling about [[Victoria Several|Victoria]], given her family history. She covers some high-level info, and says she'll give those books to [[Costi]]. [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] invites [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], she defers, claiming a need to check on [[Hugh|Finn]]. She tells [[Rez]] it's fine to go though, so she does. [[Trisha]] helps [[Rez]] decode what happened, telling her [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tried very hard to like [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]], but just didn't. [[Rez]] finds that very interesting. 

Meanwhile, [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]] go to [[The Dollhouse]]. [[Nemia]] is thrilled to see [[Hugh|Finn]] and designates a special "heroes barstool" for him. She gives him a diary from her ancestor who he was friends with, tells him a story of a time he saved a group of livestock from being burnt to death as a war tactic. She shares the happy end of [[Hugh|Finn]]'s friend's life. She confirms [[Giary]] was the best lay(s... 3) of her last decade, she hopes he's still alive from the [[Night of Storms]]. 

[[Freya]] asks [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] to come over. She throws him around and then they try [[Freya]] experimental liquor. By the time everyone arrives home, they naked in the living room.

[[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] have a bit of a heart to heart, she's worried he's sad (despite the parade), because she wouldn't sleep with him. She then does check on him, he's horrible, thanks. He sees something's up though, and follows [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] into her room. She word vomits and is clearly not exactly okay herself, but covers it supppppper smoooothly. 

Before bed, [[Hugh|Finn]] communes to [[TrueSilver]]:

Was there anything we could have done better over the past few days?
	Yes

Is it bad timing to leave [[Eberron]] right now considering the [[Alhoon]] still at large?
	No, there is work to be done everywhere.

Is it worth continuing to find romantic love? Especially if I am cursed to lose them. I donâ€™t want to keep putting others in danger
	It is always worth it.

[[Rez]] tries to get [[Trisha]] to help her decode [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s behavior last night, saying people are sometimes kind of confusing. [[Trisha]] helps a bit, but mostly conjectures. At the very least, [[Rez]] has some puzzling to do. [[Rez]] turns down a round two, saying she's got to go check on [[Hugh|Finn]] too - I mean maybe she does, maybe she doesn't. Who knows. There's a little more weight to their goodbye. 

We spend the morning debating how to undermine [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]], though not severely enough to land him a death penalty, which luckily we know will be ruled upon by the new Duke. 

Our plan is to:
1) Invite [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]] for an introductory drink to hear about his plans if he becomes Duke
2) Have [[Rez]] say she'd like to buy some of his merchandize and then go see it
3) Plant some?? evidence there
4) Modify his memory of him trying to convince [[Rez]] to get in on his illegal trade with [[Zalev]]

We plan to also reach out to [[Vragar Aldea]] to cover our interest. They both quickly and are enthusiastic. Dinner with [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]] tonight and the [[Aldea]]'s tomorrow night.
