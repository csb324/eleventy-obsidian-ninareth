# Detailed Notes: Session 89

We start by identifying all of the items we found from the [[Moradin]] party, and help out [[The Burning Sons]]: [[Skiv]] gets [[Doss Flute]], [[Nekto]] gets [[The Slip Knife]]. We also divvy up the touches, [[Costi]] takes the [[Larethian Rose]], [[Freya]]  [[Moradin's Touch]], [[Hugh]] the [[TrueSilver strand]], and [[Rez]] plans to carry [[Bahamat's Touch]].

We decide to split up to head back to [[Izdeke]]. [[Freya]] asked to made a detour to stop by some of the anchor tree roots, she'd like to talk to it. When we reach it, she touches it and we watch her briefly hear a pained groan, then her eyes rolls into the back of her head. She hears "You can still turn back, [[Freya]] of [[Polaris]]. You can go home, you can go North. I can see you there safely". She responds, "You must know too much, because I can't go home yet". He says, "It was all just a big misunderstanding, we can smooth it over, you can have your family again". She asks "who's we?". He doesn't answer but says "turn back or help me, and all will be revealed. I know they've kept answers from you, I can give them to you. I know it's what you want. I can harness the anger that you feel." She responds, "That will only get me so far, though". He promises, "I can get you further" and she deflect with, "I'll you know" before we pull her off of the root. 

Her eyes come back, she says the tree is in pain. She talked to whoever is tapping the tree, we assume [[G'zraad]]. It seems like her knew things inside her brain, was familiar with more than he should be.

We take the day to prep. The drow are reaching out to some of their allies to talk to ilithid specialists, who live closer to colonies. She says we can have a conversation with [[The Matron]] about it in a few hours. [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] talks briefly about [[Sanderson Brando]] with [[Costi]] - it's a match!

We talk a bit more about how [[G'zraad]] knows things about [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], and if he'll use it against us in the fight. [[Freya]] clarifies that of course she considered, but she wouldn't risk [[Resurrect Adrienne]] for a quicker chance home. She does say if she gets the chance, she'd like to ask him questions. 

[[Hugh]] sends to [[Magister]], "In underdark, do you have information on Ilithid? What did note say, it might be relevant to our situation. Close to getting [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back", "Well, yes some. 25 words - challenging. I'll get back to you. On note, two words: Fifth Touch, might mean more to you. Good luck". We think maybe whoever dropped it off is the [[TrueSilver]] oracle. 

"Hi [[Rawley]], it's [[Freya]]. I met a friend of yours, [[Skiv]]. She really likes you. Can we trust her? Hope you're good. She's nice. Bye" he replies, "[[Skiv]]... Haven't talked to her in a long long time. [[Skiv]]'s good people, made a couple mistakes, you can trust her. Hope you're doing well too"

[[Costi]] and [[Freya]] dissect the detect thoughts on her a bit more, [[Rez]] and [[Costi]] recognize it as the Ivory Towers of [[Thelran Asari]]. [[Freya]] knows the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]] is always there, and wonders if the halfling described as maybe [[Gulsindip Desindever]] who is the [[Roadmaster]] of the [[Wayfinders]]. Interestingly, the run orders out of the [[Temple of Pelor in Thelran Asari]]. 

[[Costi]] and [[Jade]] read more of [[Kith and Kin]] while we wait. They make significant progress. 

[[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] comes to get us for our conversation with [[The Matron]]. She starts by giving us a debrief: they have reason to believe [[G'zraad]] an ilithid of some particular power. She has spoken with other Matrons across the underdark, one of them had records of him. One with the same name lived near another Drow colony underneath [[Tinkate]], about 150 years ago - that's longer than the typical lifespan. They think he split from his colony because of arcane interests that are unacceptable to an elder brain. This means he is likely what is called an [[Alhoon]], based on the magics and altered creatures. They engage in rituals to artificially preserve their lives, some might call them a litch. This is likely in partnership with other ilithid. 

It's likely a powerful caster, while also have strong ilihtid abilities like manipulating a creatures brain, specifically those with weaker intellects. They are rarely martial fighters, but are known to rip the brains out of those they fight. [[Costi]] has learned a lot about liches, and asks if they'll have a phalectory. It's unclear, but they believe an [[Alhoon]] is not true lichdom, but use some minor phalectory, rather than a true one. We ask about the psychic connection, it is a skill of ilithid but typically requires contact. 

We make our case that [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] hold onto [[Bahamat's Touch]]. [[Rez]] shares that her whole family worships him, she's got dragon built in rather than some outer holy symbol. We think having a connection to those gods might help. She'll let [[The Burning Sons]] make their case and then decide. 

[[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] will come with us, and we plan to journey with [[The Burning Sons]] if they'll go with us. It seems the density of creatures are increasing, she encourages us to fix this quickly - she's worried that [[Izdeke]] might not be here by next Songs Day. She's worried they mount an attack while we're gone, if they are aware of our timeline. But if there are things they won't use, they'll consider giving them to us. We offer help in protecting the city until we need to leave.

That night, we get dinner with [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] and [[The Burning Sons]]. They say they've fought ilithid before, but never one with these magical powers. We ask if we should journey together. They think they've found a direct route, not our hidden one but a main route. They can pull away a significant force and we can be tactical. We decide to mix and match on our city patrols to learn each other a little bit better before the ilithid fight. 

On the Touches, [[Rieltar]] worries that we should split up in case [[G'zraad]] can do something with them should we bring all four to him together. If either group needs to pull them off of their bodies, we can do that. [[Costi]] returns with some ability to read thoughts and asks if they have any idea on why [[Moradin]]'s followers would attack us, listening to [[Rieltar]]'s surface thoughts. He replies, that they're not more violent or cruel on average, and thinks it's out of character - maybe they thought only they could do it, wanted the glory, or misinterpreted the words of their oracle. His mind while he says shows an older woman's face as he thinks about the ritual, and he feels a swell of passion as he remembers her. Costi reminds him that we're all trying to save someone and the anchor tree, and that love and grief can lead people to do terrible things. [[Rieltar]] says he can't imagine why people would chose to do that rather than work together. It doesn't seem like this thoughts show any other intent or emotions of guilt.

We swap stories of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Riveika]] - we learn she was killed by a follower of [[Bane]] in [[Thelran Asari]] named [[Janderite Kresk]]. We also warn them to stay away from [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. [[Jade]] asks if they've seen anyone like [[Rez]] in [[Thelran Asari]] or seen anything like dragon grafting. They don't, and haven't heard of anything about [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]], but haven't been in [[Thelran Asari]] for several months. 

[[Costi]] goes to spare with [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]]. He becomes her *student*, and turns out he does like a girl with a knife. He comes back to our quarters for us all to get our long rest.

The next day, [[Costi]] thinks about any [[AVAD]] professors who knows anything about ilithid named [[People/Eberron/Professor Rohed]]. "Professor, crazy question. Ever heard of [[Alhoon]]? What do you know? All information is useful. How do you kill? Hope you're well. [[Costi|Constantine]]. Thanks", he responds "Academic, I hope. [[Alhoon]] share phalectory. Unlikely to revive, but transfer memories and knowledge. They die like any other. Careful!"

We split up into three groups with [[The Burning Sons]]. [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]], [[Costi]], [[Rieltar]], and [[Durembur]] fight a hoard of undead creatures. [[Jade]], [[Freya]], [[Skiv]], and [[Felnyra Svenik]] fight several unusual umberhulk, they have different features. [[Hugh]], [[Rez]], [[Nekto]], and a beefy drow find an underground pool of water and a hydra.   

We meet back in [[Izdeke]], and have dinner with [[The Burning Sons]].  [[Freya]] has a private conversation with [[Skiv]], she asks if there's anything she's wary about with the [[Wayfinders]]. She worries that [[Rawley]] is a private person, and said he always fixated on [[Polaris]] and wanted something there. It's why he ended up being the [[Overseer of the North]]. She says if [[Rawley]] has taken an interest in her, whether she leans in or not depends on how big a life she wants to have. [[Freya]] isn't sure how to answer that or what she wants. [[Skiv]] warns there's a lot more to the [[Wayfinders]] and [[Rawley]] than meets the eye, and seems to be emphasizing that word. If [[Freya]] sticks with [[Rawley]], she will have experiences she wouldn't have otherwise - and [[Skiv]] didn't stick with him. 

[[Costi]] gets a dream from [[Magister]], he's aboard the airship of [[Victoria Several]]. [[Costi]] gives him the synopsis of what we've learned. [[Magister]] and [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] did some research, they are resistant to cold, electricity, and necrotic damage. He thinks at least 3 [[Alhoon]] work together to establish their phalectory. They don't tend to operate together, it's more common for them to separate. Rarely does one have the phalectory in person, as it gives unequal power. [[Alhoon]] come from a group of 9 ilithid who did the first pact, all current ones take their name from that original group. They must continue to breed if they want their undeath to continue, and prefers more elderly brains. They haven't learned anything about the anchor tree. However, it seems like after this we'll have two new enemies. We say we plan to go to [[Quaath]] then [[Eberron]], if we need a ride just ask. They've had some interesting developments, a 'new friend'. 

We all get a rest before a day of heading down to explore the tunnels. In the morning, we each swap a recognizable item so we can locate each other. We begin to head below.

We sneak and make it to the room with the goo where we fought through undead, make our way quietly to the false wall. In the room with the dead undead gith, we open the secret tunnel and recognize it's a one way door but plan for [[Samuel]] to help us out. 

Part of the way down, [[Freya]] hears a weird breathing like sound. [[Samuel]] flies down to investigate, and about 30 feet down he sees a pale pink light once the stairs end where a small receiving chamber is blocked off by a large yellow membranous wall. After confirming the wall is opaque, we head down to investigate. Looking more closely, we can see it's sandpapery and rough - it has a slot in it about 4 feet high. [[Costi]] looks through with his ghostly gaze, and sees a vast wide cavern ahead. The floor ends right after the membrane with stone walls on either side. [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] notices it could fit a sword, and we remember the silvered sword from the gith that [[Freya]]'s carrying. Sliding it in, we hear a whir and the membrane appears to make some eyes that look at us, but it doesn't retract. 

[[Jade]] puts the sword back in and makes a small illusion of us killing the ilithid, the wall speaks to her to ask what happened to the others. We say they fell, but we want to take care the ilithid. She's persuasive, and says to avenge the Gith and bring the wall back it's head. 

[[Costi]] pulls the coffin from [[Vask]] out of [[My Hole]]. He uses the new [[Ring of Telekinesis]] to levitate it and we ferry across the cavern. 

Making our way forward, we try to sneak through some more tunnels but [[Costi]] is playing with his new ring and accidentally rips a boulder out of the wall. We hear something shuffle closer and moan, "food?" There's a Hungry from [[The Shadowfell]] and four drow from [[Izdeke]] who are zombies. 

Afterwards, [[Costi]] consoles [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] for a moment, and uses his newfound knowledge of [[The Raven Queen]] to help. She's worried about [[Bagath Mizzragon]], who she reveals is both her father and closer to her than [[Izdeke]] prefers. She asks for reassurance [[Costi]] will put him at rest too, if he find that's what he needs. 

We try to heal [[Freya]] of the poison the drow used, it typically lasts for an hour so we decide to wait it out. We all short rest, and during discuss if a polymorphed [[Freya]] would still survive her brain being eaten - it seems likely. 

We decide to split up and have [[Rez]] and [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] scout ahead - very quickly they start to notice tree roots, we have to carefully duck around them. It will be challenging to do quietly and without touching them. After about a 40 minute journey downward, we find an overpowering stench. We decide to stop and turn around there. 

After we fill our party in, we decide to find a niche and long rest. [[Hugh]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]] to send to [[Rieltar]], "Have you gotten to safehouse? Time for assault? Earlier is better. Signal? Based 45 minutes from illithid. Can check in tomorrow morning." He replies "Safe and sound, snug as a bug. It was dicey, I'm bleeding. All sounds good, will wait for your signal. Timing should work."

Morning comes. We game plan for a few moments, then swallowing our nerves head down. 

[[Hugh]] sendings to [[Rieltar]], "We are moving. Will be at illithid home in 45. Should we wait? Should we expect help during illithid fight? Signal start with loud sound. see you soon," he responds: "Wait 10, and we should be coordinated just right. If we make it to the room, yes! But be ready to be solo. And will do."

We make our way down to the illithid room, [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] gives us another pass without a trace, and we mostly move quietly, [[Freya]] does brush a root. Hope that doesn't mess anything up! 

Jade gives intellect fortress to Freya and Rez - advt int wis cha svt, resistance to psychic damage 

Freya casts Longstrider on Hugh and Jade, +10 movement speed 

We reach the point we scouted the day before and right as we do, we hear Rieltar yell “for pekoe’s god damnit”

As we walk into the room, we hear the sound of conflict out the side entrance. Roots of [[Weirefesteria]]'s anchor tree run through out the room, and pools of the necrotic goo are puddled. We see two large zombie ogres, a handsome older drow man who we assume to be [[Bagath Mizzragon]], and a tentacled creature about 7ft tall with gold fingers -- [[G'zraad]]. He says "you finally arrive. I've said it before and I'll say it again. It' is not too late, you can turn around, you can come take a look (pointing at the largest section of root, where a large pulsing void is on it), you can take a look inside and see what we have to offer"
"
[[Bagath Mizzragon]] pulls out a holy symbol that is [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]]. 

"violence resistance is futile, lay down your arms and join us", when we're up he adss "why can't you see sense?" "We offer the end"

Jade's sunglasses flash when she looks at [[G'zraad]]. [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] has a beautiful and brutal exchange before killing her father, [[Bagath Mizzragon]]. 

As he dies, we hear screams from the pools below, goo bursting. [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] kisses [[Costi]], [[Freya]] pulls [[Jade]] over to get the holy symbol off of [[Bagath Mizzragon]]. [[The Burning Sons]]  arrive, all healthy, but ask for the Touches and try to say they should be the one to do it. 

Duremebeur says children, you heard the prophecy wrong. We swtiched the tempermentals prophecy "Sun shine will shine, and one who fought will rise again". [[Skiv]] leaves rather than hurt another [[Wayfinders]]. 

Rez says that as much as she wants adirenne back she would not forgive us if we killed people for it, and if rivekia is a good person I would hope she wouldn't either. durembur and nekto both leave and tell him if he does this it'll have to be on his own.

rez says all of his friends are gone, don't do this. He cuts his holy symbol off and says "fisx this and know we leave here as enemies"

Hugh casts a ritual to truesilver and says "is it true that this ritual would only bring one person or can my touch help this" his head snaps to the hole, and he sees a blinding brown fire burn, and stepping out of it he sees one singular form.

they leave, but say they'll all be enemies this point out. [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] says she'll be sure they're escorted out, unless we want to kill them - decline.

we approach together the void, and even as we watch it seems to slowly be expanding. We each carry a touch. they seem to work on divine magic almost without our aid. As the cover the void, vines grow and cover the area,
