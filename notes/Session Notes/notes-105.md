# Detailed Notes: Session 105

In the [[Burbank Compound]] garden, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh]] are seeking solace. While playing her harp, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] fixates on the turnips that [[Private Hageth]] was responsible for - and start to channel her energy there. They start to grow more and more plentiful, taking over nearby other patches. 

After about an hour, [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] comes over - she is with [[Dania]]. They're bringing a body, assuming it's [[Private Hageth]] to bury here in the gardens. She lays the first spade full of dirt herself, and unearths one of the new monster turnips to include with him. [[Hugh]] adds a half-knitted hat. 

Back in our chambers, [[Rez]] and [[Freya]] sip from a bottle and keep an eye on [[Costi]] - who is trying to commune with an absent [[Samuel]] to try and shepard those lost to their resting place. they debate what makes death, and killing, more or less sad - but really devolve into bickering on who is more killable between the two of them - until they're distracted by [[Costi|Cost-ape]] destroying his room. 

Eventually, he wears himself out and [[Samuel]] finally appears, and [[Costi]] is able to connect in with the death spirits of those who were killed. He is able to choose which of those he's interested in helping. He starts with [[Private Hageth]], then [[Marina Alduchev]], and [[Nicky]] - then moves to decide to help all of them. Despite some hesitation from [[Samuel]], he achieves his goal. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] reconvenes together, and talks through a bit of what happened. [[Costi]] feels better after his work, he guided them all to the same place. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] lifts the mood a bit by opening up, and saying that she did not appreciate [[The Unforged Few]] fully until seeing what it was like when [[Freya]] died. But now she realizes that we're here for each other. 

We decide to stay in our rooms for the day, and do a family dinner. Seems the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] have the same idea. Before bed [[Costi]] sendings to [[Costi's mom]], "[[Marina Alduchev]] and [[Nicky]] are dead. Fuck the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]]. Tell Mariana's mother, I am sorry. How can I help the cause mom?" She replies, "I'm so sorry, son. How long did they have Nicky? Keep your head down, stay safe. Can't afford another problem". He asks [[Hugh]] to sending a follow-up, "Hello wife, had [[Nicky]] for a minimum of 72 hours, 12 in [[Burbank Compound]]" she responds, "Thank you, Hugh. If you can, notify me if troops leave in 3 days. Especially under [[Grishomec Teld]]" -- this information starts to trigger [[Hugh]] breakdown, but [[Costi]] is able to rewind time and put us on another path. It seems like name triggers some of his unearthed memories. 

[[Hugh]] teaches [[Dania]] [[Rez]]'s version of checkers. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] goes to borrow a hair curler from [[Trisha]] - she opens up a bit about how tough the family is taking the executions. She says they were close with [[Private Hageth]]. He wasn't capable of treason, but was on guard duty near the gate and found by the [[Eberronian Seventh Brigade]]. They're 'well-run'. She says it was 9th strike, but was still a more harsh sentence than was warranted. After some chit-chat, she asks [[Trisha]] what she was waiting for in [[Viliki]], but only gets diversions for an answer. There's some definitely not weighted not subtext at all chat about [[Rez]], and she learns that [[Trisha]] will be going back to court in [[Eberron City]] for a few days. [[Trisha]] asks about [[Costi]] - then thanks us again, and says if there's anything they can do, for him or any of us, she doesn't know if it's enough but it's what they can do. And as she leaves, tells her she has two hours before someone ([[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]) arrives. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] comes back in and tells us that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] will be here soon - she bluffs shockingly well that she's not worried, and thinks she'll be best to talk to him alone. Yet we're all summoned. [[Costi]] says he'll stay back, and we agree that's for the best. 

We enter to find [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], and a young-adult halfling who's making some notes in a corner. He seems emotionally impacted for a moment upon seeing her, and they swap pleasantries. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] mentions her surprise for [[Henrik]], and [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] mentions he had a letter for her but it "slipped his mind". We're introduced to the newest employee [[Starstool Daygrip]]. We learn he's an accomplished flutist, but plays several instruments, sings, and writes too. He joined [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s employee after [[Henrik]]'s election. 

He brings out boxes for each of us, as a thank you for helping [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] come back. For her, he has a gorgeous sapphire necklace carved to look like blue roses with silver vines connecting them together. [[Hugh]] gets a silver wand with dwarven sketched across "for hearth for home", and explains it's a fire starter to make hearths. [[Freya]] gets a hinterberry pie, which only grows near [[Polaris]]. [[Rez]] gets a necklace of brass dragonscales near [[Taleem]], picked it up about a fortnight ago, her excitement grows solemn. [[Costi]]'s gift comes from [[Professor Vendorsmere]], some sort of black stone that should help his swordsmanship. 

He asks for report, and she says there must've been a misunderstanding - she understood he terminated the [[The Unforged Few]], and she was to end her work together after the [[Arkhosian Elections]] completion. He also clarifies that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] wasn't legally part of [[The Unforged Few|The Few]] upon our termination. He seems to agree to transition to a "more collegial" relationship, she brings up our work in [[Viliki]] but he's more focused on how she was brought back. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] explains it was by the grace of [[Corellon Larethian]] and she awoke under a tree in [[Dilandil]], and that [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] had been lead there. That she was pulled here for a purpose, which is why she must stop her relationship with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. He pushes her on what that "purpose" is, and she asks him to share if he hears of any unexpected undead. 

He seems to know quite a bit about our efforts to restore [[Hugh]]'s memories, and learn that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] has established a way to travel to the [[Burbank Compound]] extremely easily from almost anywhere. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] reiterates that we should double check [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s ask, as he's so error prone. Then he makes a comment about the women behind every great man, shifting from [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] in a way that makes us all uncomfy. 

He alludes that he's next traveling to [[Dilandil]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] doesn't take the bait on the potential veiled threat. Before he leaves, he makes weird eyes at [[Rez]] on "letting us know if hears anything", and asks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] for a song - she plays beautifully and adds a bit more oomfh to a song she spent all of her effort learning from her senior year at [[Redscale]]. 

They end with her thanking him for the ways he helped her grow, and they ended with a handshake. 

We ask [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] if it's done, and she quickly corrects us that he threatened both her family and [[Rez]]'s. 
 
We head back to our room, and show [[Costi]] our gifts, and asks him to identify all of them. None of them are magic except his [[Obsidian Whetsone]] if you spend 1 min sharpening your blade, the next 10 minutes you add +1 to attack rolls. This can be used three times. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] finds a note from [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] inviting her to his vacation estate in northern [[Arkhosia]], for fun and not as work. She uses the sending circlet to thank him and say she'll work to find the time. 

[[Costi]] works on the necromancy books he picked up, as well as the book on [[Opal (silver hand)]]. She was born in [[Taleem]], not much is known before adulthood, she was known to have exceptional aptitude for getting out of places naturally, and to traverse the planes like blink. She has no recorded of admittance to the [[The Slavaadi College]] but had many connections there and seemed to have spent time and learned. Fought in military conflicts as a mercenary for several groups, collecting a small following, then went off the map for 15 years. Her last expedition was in [[Turian Waste]] near [[Gu’athrithen]]. Nothing else was heard until her corpse was found. Shortly after it was found, it was vanished and has not been seen. It's believed she helped create [[The Silver Hand]] and their funds were used to finance her research in [[dunamancy]]. Many of her writings reference [[Morthos|M]]. 

[[Rez]] goes to pick up the same book she read earlier. [[Hugh]] starts to knit a hat for [[Quinn Keplin]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to talk with [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] about the understanding she's just reached with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], but she's been called away for business in [[Thalfar]]. [[Rez]] spends some more quality time with [[Trisha]], wants to get a vibe check but gets distracted, she also asks for her favor from [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] being looking into the book she found in his library, and asking for anymore info. 

[[Costi]] has [[Samuel]] fly around to look for troop movement and to listen for [[Grishomec Teld]]. He sees that in the southeast part of the compound, around 800 troops are gathering to depart. He also notices someone name the large gray-furred minotaur we've seen before, and notes he's part of the [[Eberronian Seventh Brigade]]. [[Costi]] sendings to [[Costi's mom]], just to share they've been gathering and asks who he is. She replies "I'll tell you more, when you need to know. Best that you're just eyes for now. Answer soon".

[[Freya]] sendings to [[Ronan]], "you don't get to be happy. to hear from me. No, I won't tell you where I am. What in the hell, fuck you man", he replies, "there's nothing I can say, this way, to make things better. There is so much I didn't know, that you didn't know. Please - talk to me Freya". We ask if she still has feelings, or if he's maybe sincere. [[Freya]] isn't sure, and isn't sure how she feels about her tribe and the leadership and the people who put her in jail. She decides to make him wait more.

[[Hugh]] agrees to send to [[Adrienne's Family]], [[Darek Spout]] saying "Hello. My name is Hugh. I saw you once before. Need to pass on a message from Adrienne. No matter how mad you are she’s protecting", then again "[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] visiting [[Dilandil]], assistant [[Starstool Daygrip]]. Don't accept gifts, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] knows your hearing these. Please stay safe" then "Julian no longer has Adrienne in employ. He will hurt you to hurt her. He can hurt through you because she loves and cares for you. Please respond".

[[Hugh]] says he did not respond well, and was very mean, "Tell that selfish bitch I kept family safe without her, and we don’t need meddling. If she wants to talk, come talk to my face." [[Hugh]] responded that he needed to continue to protect his family, and he asked him not to contact him again. 

After a few days, we get an notification that [[Quinn Keplin]] has arrived and is ready to meet. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] are both there, along with a very tall (8ft) warforged, who's extremely slender with long thin arms and legs, a long neck, and a head that comes to a fine sharp point, and each of the four fingers are about a foot long. [[Hugh]] greets him by providing the blue knitted hat he made. 

[[Hugh]] asks [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] to leave so we can talk with [[Quinn Keplin]]. He starts by discussing how the procedure would work. He advises him to take a few, as there are three parts, each for a different part to be mended. Each portion is different: he febranum - an engine (core sense of self), his heart (constitution), and addressing damage to his brain's circuitry (who am I and what are my memories?). The last will require more work than the others. He shares a gas, [[etherum]], which he developed that can still the febranum to simulate death.  [[Hugh]]'s case is more complicated than others, though he's only lost one of the eighty-six he's done similar procedures on. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] can help though, through bringing an anchor to the [[Hugh]] that he is now, and not reverting to the [[Hugh]] that he was. We can also strengthen his will for him to maintain himself throughout the procedure. 

[[Quinn Keplin]] also asks to see [[Costi]]'s [[pocketwatch]], he says [[SVN models]] have an augmentation in their febranum brought between [[Planes of existence]] to anchor them. [[There's Plainly Something Wrong with the Planes]]?

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] sends [[Hugh]] off to run an errand and we plan how we'll help each other and him during the procedures. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talks to [[Hugh]] that evening, and brings up [[Hugh]]'s self-blame when she died. He shares he's worried his connection to [[TrueSilver]] is not strong due to his past, and what warforged are trained to do. 

We ask [[Hugh]] what he'd like to do tonight, and he says to spend time with us. [[Costi]] calls hoimself [[Hugh]]'s son for the first time.  us. [[Costi]] calls himself [[Hugh]]'s son for the first time. Before bed, he casts divination, asking, "I. don't really have a questions. More of a request - if I do not survive, please protect my friends". 

We send a note to [[Quinn Keplin]] and he tells us to meet at 10.

When we arrive, [[Hugh]] straps into a table with heavy restraints that clamp along his arms and legs. [[Quinn Keplin]] gives him the potion, and he goes unconscious, appearing as dead. He then begins to open him up, showing wires but also bits of flesh. 

As he starts to work on the febranum, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] takes the flame necklace off of [[Hugh]] and places it against her harp, then begins playing the song that reminds him of truesilver and lingered at the hearth post her death. [[Freya]] then brings [[Maurice]], sharing words about how they have bonded over their love for animals, and [[Hugh]] has never met a creature or person too big or too small or care about. She then cast speak with animals and translates for [[Maurice]] of what he loves about [[Hugh]]. 

[[Hugh]] eyes open, sees a vast empty plane in every direction. He has no concept of anything, just aware of an immediate existence. He begins to walk, after a while, noticing the ground humming beneath him. In the distance, he seems a vast mountain range, remembering all at once that the concept of mountains exist. He heads towards them, eventually finding a small path. Climbing, he effortlessly makes his way up for seemingly hours. Finally cresting them, he sees on the left black clouds swirling, storming, reminding him of many clouds he's seen before. Red streaks of energy fleck through them, as a bolt of red lightning hits the mountainside right below him - yet it doesn't hurt, it feels like a greeting. On the right, soft silver clouds, drifting to meet in the middle in front of him. Between both is a soft red flame, quiet and warm. As he stares between the two, soft harp music circles into the environment, and while he can choose either, he heads towards the soft silver clouds on the right. As he moves, another bolt of red lightning shoots out, with a sense of anger and despair, hitting him with much less friendly energy. 
 
As [[Quinn Keplin]] concludes the first procedure, he says it was successful but [[Hugh]] would determine how it went. He begins higher on the second, targeted some tubes filled with black or red liquid twisted into a shape of a heart. [[Costi]] casts haste on himself, and in a flurry of motion cast every dunamancy and chronamancy spell he knows to pull and consolidate the weave around him to bolster his heart and body to keep living. 

Meanwhile, [[Hugh]] has traversed to the verdant grass and is walking through a lovely glade. Eventually, he sees a couple of small cottages built along a hillside. He knocks on a door, as a dwarven woman answers and recognizes him, offering to make him tea. He says he's confused and doesn't know where he is - she answers he's in him, getting a better sense of himself. She says she's "a friend, dear" and glad that he walked her war. She tells him how proud she is of him, that he walks a difficult path, with difficult choices, but she's inspired by how he's unbroken by them while still honoring each on he must make. She says it's important to her that he always keeps that piece of him, and there will be more hard choices to make. As long as he follows that, she'll be a part of him. 

She says, "remember" as a shudder courses through him, and he ends up on a battlefield in a familiar melee. He's momentarily overwhelmed by the noise and the smell of blood and smoke. Hundreds of [[Eberron]]ians are fighting around him. Two, he feels like he knows, one with a ponytail and scars on their face and a warforged barely holding onto life, chest ripped open beside him. [[Hugh]] casts beacon of hope to help them both, then heals the warforged on the ground. As he's healing, the warrior fighting beside him is run through, but silver flame knits him back together and he's able to overcome his opponent. A shout behind him makes him turn, as a gray minotaur brings a cat of nine tails down over his face. [[Hugh]] feels a pulsing in his arm, and attacks - struggling for a moment then aided by the red lightning that had earlier coursed through him. He strikes twice. He feels the impulse to strike again, almost uncontrollable, but then is able to stop himself. Instead, he tries to calm emotions and is able to get him to drop his whip and the melee disappears. 

It's been another hour and a half, as the magic [[Costi]] brings forward saturates the area. [[Quinn Keplin]] begins moving very quickly, and starts to reconfigure areas while replacing anything that is seemingly damaged. 

He then presses a few buttons to move his head forward and starts addressing damage to his brain's circuitry. There are hundreds of wires, many with cuts, fraying, rips, and coils. [[Rez]] reads [[Charkus]]'s letter to [[Hugh]] to help bring back memories: 

“Hugh, I know you don’t remember me. I’m so sorry for whatever happened to you, this world was always too hard for someone with as pure a soul as you. I hope you know that I’ve never stopped loving you, not a single day. I’ll always remember our time together, every time I smell gorgonzola my heart skips a beat, and I can’t drink apple juice without smiling.  
  
The greatest days of my life were those spent in your arms, and the greatest gift I was ever given was to be part of your life. I’m so glad I got to see you one last time, and I hope that one day you can read this and know that your Charki loves you.”

In [[Hugh]]'s mind, he begins to fall and drift through nothing. He lands, and is sitting around a fire. He's in his [[Beating Heart Battalion]] uniform, across from him is a friendly face, ponytail and scarred face, [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]. He asks him how drills were today, and said he heard what [[Grishomec Teld]] said. He has to stop actively going against what he says. He coaches him on being more strategic and what the repercussions are. They play go-fish together,  then everything goes blank. 

Eyes opening from slumber, [[Hugh]] wakes to feel an arm around his chest and sees the scarred face of [[Eva]]. She brings him a potent cheese and drink, and asks how his poem writing has been. He reads a few lines about purple flowers and her eyes in the moonlight. They kiss, and have a soft conversation. 

Another blackout, and he's on his feet. A dragonborn walks circles around him, [[Lister]] who is drilling him on martial forms. He remembers how much time he's taken to help teach him, and run forms. [[Hugh]] continues to run drills, with a driving urge to make him proud. 

He fades out again, hundreds of faces flitting in front of him, until he's sitting at the head of a huge table, with thousands of people sitting and laughing around him. At the other end, is a warm hearth lighting the whole room. Next to him, on either side, is [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. Beside [[Costi]], is [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]. Beside [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], is [[Eva]]. When suddenly the table goes quiet, and everyone looks to him. A young man with a red beret raises a toast, and [[Hugh]] thanks everyone for being here. He is shocked there is a table this large, but really, thank you for being here. As the glasses clink, some faces fade, but many stay. Then once again, his vision goes black. 

We watch while [[Quinn Keplin]] connects wire, twisting some apart, and occasionally, pulling a few out with sighs. After half an hour, he pulls away and puts [[Hugh]]'s head back together. He says it was successful, as long as he returns. 

As he awakens, he greets us and seems upbeat. [[Quinn Keplin]] says there are a few things he will not be able to remember, but he won't be triggered by any failures to remember either. He says [[SVN models]] have internal composition that makes it extremely hard to separate who they are, which is why he had to be reset so many times. He also shows a hunk of metal, that looks like a black gauntlet, which we recognize as the holy symbol of [[Bane]]. It was augmented at least 90 years ago, perhaps to counter the goodness in him, and [[Quinn Keplin]] removed the parts that were connected to it. 

He says he might of met [[TrueSilver]], at least the parts that live inside him. He asks for cheese, and reminds us that he was in love. With multiple people, in fact, and is quite good at sex. 

[[Hugh]] immediately casts sending - "I am back. Where are you?", [[Eva]] "Hey there [[29]], I'm not in [[Eberron]] anymore that's for damn sure. [[Thelran Asari]], the last 4 years. Come visit, we'd love to see you"

[[Costi]] asks if he remembers [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], and he remembers him twice. One whole life were they were brothers in arms, before a reset. Then him seeking [[Hugh|Finn]] out again, and teaching all of the same things once more. He remembers him being wounded, but never saw him die. He remembers 17 years of sitting in the forest. 

[[Costi]] asks if he remembers his message from [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] differently, and [[Hugh]] shares:

"Never forget my love for the family.  
I only wish I'd see you one last time.  
Raise a stone for me by the Klendon Glade.  
Kiss the kids, don't let Costi lose the blade."

[[Hugh]] remembers this being told to him, but it was planted in some way. Not maliciously, but intentionally placed. He thinks back to when that happened, was when he was being burned by the followers of [[Moradin]]. We all try to decipher what it means, but don't get far.

We ask [[Finn]] what he wants to do tonight, and he says he wants to experience something. He decides to go drink, and we pick a place where the soldiers go. 

Outside, beside [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] two warforged are waiting out there, it's [[Marigold]] and [[Ligo]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] goes to tell the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] that [[Hugh]] doesn't want to see them. 

As soon as they leave, [[Hugh|Finn]] goes out and immediately hugs [[Marigold]]. She's clearly super excited and rambunctious. After pleasantly interrogating him, invites him to a "welcome dinner" that's apparently warforged only, and we all decide to go get beers tonight. 

[[Shishta's]] is the bar they recommend we go to, and as we get there [[Marigold]] shows us around. [[Finn]] immediately gets flirting with her, [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] all watches in shock. She tells us that the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] sort out mean or nice people into different battalions and keep them separate. 

[[Rez]] tells [[Hugh|Finn]] he should sending [[Magister]], and it gets us diverted for a while asking if there's anyone we know that he knew from before. [[Ligo]] comes back with lots of drinks, and we'll shift to celebrating. 

[[Marigold]] keeps trying to stereotype peg all of us, and [[Hugh]] asks if there's thing he should know - she says yes but doesn't elaborate. [[Hugh|Finn]] says he doesn't intend to stay, and pretty blatantly says he doesn't trust him. [[Marigold]] disagrees, and they talk about whether [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] fixing them is enough to make up for his role in their memory wipes. 

We ask about [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Marigold]] at the same time, learning they're about the same age. [[Finn]]'s first memory being sunlight, and all of their maturity is naturally in their mind upon creation. 

[[Ligo]] asks if [[Hugh|Finn]] can do anything more now, and he expresses reticence to try. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] reminds that he has a gift at the quartermaster, if he wants it. [[Freya]] offers to fight, but [[Finn]] emphasizes he know what he likes. 

We also learn that [[Ligo]] has died, and follows [[Tyr]] - his afterlife was short, but he had a sword in his hand. They leave to go to their jobs, but [[Marigold]] begs [[Hugh|Finn]] to let them through him a party, and invites the rest of us to the afterparty. When he agrees, they leave.

Alone, instead of talking about anything serious, we all start asking [[Hugh|Finn]] about his type. We learn he's dated a lot of people, of many different types, but that [[Eva]] had taught him to knit. We encourage him to go get back into the swing of things, and he plays cards with a guy [[Nadid]] who is clearly interested and also clearly too drunk. 

[[Hugh]] messages [[Rez]] and they seem to have an extra glint. We gather up drunk [[Costi]] and head back to our rooms. As we head back, [[Hugh|Finn]] sees a figure watching us go -- [[Grishomec Teld]] stares as we go, before making eye contact and heading in. 

Everyone goes to bed, well after a bit anyways. Welcome back to full personhood [[Hugh|Finn]]!!
