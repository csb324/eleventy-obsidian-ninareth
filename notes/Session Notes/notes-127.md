# Detailed Notes: Session 127

We take stock of our bearings, [[Freya]] thinks she can navigate us there avoiding the roads by staying away from the canal.

We decide to try to rest up and start walking. Thinking back, it seems like all of the draconics that attacked the ship died - but they "got what they needed". We try to parse out what that might've meant. Sending information? 

After almost siccing [[Freya]] on a sleeping owlbear so she could 'win', we find a cave to bed down for the night. 

In the night, [[Freya]] wakes to [[The Curator]] sitting just outside the hut. They say they've been busy as [[The Collection]] has been very active. She asks for her blood back, and [[The Curator]] gives her half a vial back. They tell her to "hold onto it, it might change color and develop an interesting property". She can drink it, if so. Not think too hard about it. 

One of the other members in [[The Collection]] could use some help "a couple of individuals who you'd like to make happy would be happy if you'd do this for them", and it's right on the way to [[Jezeten]]. What a happy coincidence. She asks them about the letter she received, and [[The Curator]] says "at this point I know everything you know" - as though she'd experienced it, by helping [[Freya]] come back. She doesn't know *who* gave her the letter, but if [[Freya]] does this task they believe they have someone who can help them get to the bottom of this. A trade for trade. They got a premonition to see her fight with the draconics, "If someone in [[The Collection]] does something remarkable, she gets a little tingle". They tease that [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] will be happy with the outcome, or that we'll be very disappointed if don't.

On the way between here and [[Jezeten]] under a day's travel from our cave is what appears a nondescript burnt out military outpost, [[Fort Studtrodd]], [[Freya]] needs to cut the 47th chain from the left. They can't say more. 

As we walk, [[Costi]] pulls out the 6x6 square of folded black velvet fabric, blank except for a perfectly spherical drop of blood, we found sewn into the inside of [[Lukan]]'s armor. [[Freya]] determines it has illusory magic, and they try to look through it. [[Rez]] can determine it's not an illusion, she and [[Costi]] the magic is emanating from the blood. [[Hugh|Finn]] doesn't think it has a religious energy. 

[[Freya]] decides to prick her finger to get a single drop of blood and drop it into the fabric, per [[Rez]]'s suggestion. [[Freya]] sees the blood move along the velvet, forming script, it says "Hail bloodseeker, [[fourteen rue promade]], after nine". [[Costi]] shares that's a rich street in [[New Fairhaven]]. 

We realize the trail is perhaps an abandoned trail leading to a tower, about 35ft tall and covered in scorch marks, that make us think of [[Golstrava]]. 

[[Freya]] confesses she led us here, and has a task to do - but doesn't want to implicate or trick anyone else in [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. The group is unhappy, especially [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]], but no one plans to stop her. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] warns that if this is like the horrors in [[Golstrava]] she might need someone to pull her out, and [[Rez]] says she can't let her go alone. 

Inside, it's fully rotted out. There's nothing on the first floor, the second has skeletal remains and weapons decaying throughout the area, [[Freya]] can tell they were probably burned to death. It seems clear this was a dragon attack. 

[[Costi]] decides to pop [[Samuel]] out to help, but before they can talk he flies off directly to the tower. That's concerning. [[Hugh|Finn]] expresses some frustration that [[Freya]] keeps engaging with [[The Curator]], but nervous they head to wait outside with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. 

[[Freya]] and [[Rez]] head up to the third floor, it's even more devastated by flames. There's no chains visible anywhere inside. [[Costi]] looks through his ghostly gaze and finds a trap door, being SUPER HOITY-TOITY about it. 

We argue as we head down the cellar, halfway down the stairs a panel opens and says "SVN detected" but at the prospect of needing his involvement [[Hugh|Finn]] mocks [[Freya]] they argue, and he turns to leave. Panicking, [[Rez]] uses magic to create a replica of [[Hugh|Finn]]'s finger and places it on the pad just in time to prevent the stair trap. She half-yells at the group to not let anyone die, but no one really listens.

Standing on the stairs, we have yet again, a tense conversation about forced involvement and who should be held responsible. [[Rez]] tries to break the tension with various [[Finn finger]] jokes, but eventually [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] makes the call that we should all be in if we're in together. 

We reach a door with another panel and have to use the [[Finn finger]] again, but it seems to deactivate locks. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] flags that this building seems timed to [[The Three Dragons War]] but [[SVN models]] weren't around then, so [[Hugh|Finn]] says we should be on alert if this is maybe tied to [[Sven]]. The door remains locked, so [[Rez]] offers to pick it. Despite it being extremely complicated, she just pops it right open. 

[[Freya]] leading the way, we walk into the room. It is 40 feet across and in the shape of a pentagon. In the center of the room there is a large one sided mirror free floating. It an oval full length mirror with silver edging. On each of the walls there are hooks. The door behind closes and vanishes. 

Starting on the wall to the left of the entrance, and going clockwise, there is an increasing number of tally marks (1,2,3,4,5). Asking [[The Curator]] if she should hang the mirror on the walls, with every ask [[Freya]] gets a "yes". As it hangs, the surface becomes light blue and shimmery. [[Costi]] send [[Samuel]] through, and when he returns, [[Freya]] steps through. 

She sees a long row of cells, each houses a skeleton. There are ten on either side. Interestingly, there are no chains. Above the portal, inside the new room, there was a signifier "S" over the doorway. The seemed much more recently killed, but still decades old, probably less than 180 years and more than 80. [[Costi]] goes to look for signs of last rites, but finds nothing.

A similar process happens on wall 2, and it's immediately very cold. It seems to be a frozen body of water, snow is coming down heavily and a stool with an ice fishing hole and rod is nearby. It's baited with a gold ball of some sort. She throws in the line, and only waits a few seconds before feeling something bite. Dangling on the end of the line, is a mackerel. [[Freya]] tries to speak to it but it lunges and bites her, trying to drink her blood and deals necrotic damage. Popping it, she gets the bobber and see inside is a golden "M" charm in the same font as the S in the previous portal. [[Freya]] takes it with her.

The third portal is extremely hot, her foot sinking into an endless field of ash. She starts looking for anything noteworthy, her feet hits an ankle bone. She starts trying to find other bones. [[Hugh|Finn]] comes in a notices a bump where the ash is piled higher. It's a badly burned deck of cards, but they're are all Aces. 

Portal number 4 has a dinner party with 5 people, all sitting and talking. As [[Freya]] steps through, she notices everything is a bit blurry, particularly their faces. Their conversation stops and the faces morph into those she knows: [[Petra]], [[Ronan]], [[Rawley]], [[Akros]], and [[Hugh|Finn]]. They all break into eerie unnatural smiles, the flesh tearing on the edges as the smiles increase. The begin to walk towards her, as in unison they all say "smile [[Freya]]". The faux-Finn begins to cut into the corners of her mouth. 

As [[Costi]] walks in, he see [[Hugh|Finn]], [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]], and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] cutting into [[Freya]]'s face. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] pops her head in, but is forcefully shoved out by [[Freya]]. The table is covered with silver, and salt, sugar bowls, smoked sausages. Seeing the pattern they run out.

The final room is unbelievably hot, with erupting rock and a deep chasm. Ahead there's a city, creatures with bat wings flying overhead. She is spotted by an imp, and it sounds the alarm. Several creatures turn to see her. She hits a few of them and heads back in.

We've picked up the pattern and smash the mirror. It reveals a hole downward with stairs, and we hear activity up ahead. The room is covered in chains. Some moving, being pulled by creatures. There are several suits of armor moving from chain to chain, two humanoids that look like people except for patches of bone peaking through but still seem to conversing. Sitting in a chair, overseeing the activity, is a warforged with a collar around it's neck is a large O.
