# Detailed Notes: Session 122

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] buys some ivory strips and incense, enough for two castings. [[Hugh|Finn]] starts with [[Songwarden’s Solace]] and the [[Yew Sword]], he gets strong scents not found in the incense he uses and as he finishes his vision clouds, he hears a light sonorous voice (not [[TrueSilver]]s) say "[[Songwarden’s Solace]] and the yew blade have only been borne by 7, but each of those 7 served a purpose. Now, they're carried by an 8th. And her purpose, might be the grandest yet. Only those deemed worthy by [[Corellon Larethian]] are able to wield [[Songwarden’s Solace]] and withdraw the blade. And as [[Corellon Larethian]]'s champion devotion deepens and as they follow their path, they will find solace within the harp as with [[Ninarith]]". 

[[Costi]] attempts to draw the [[Yew Sword]] but it won't even form enough for him to find a handle. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] wants to visit [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] and [[Marigold]], but they're occupied for the next few days. 

[[Costi]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]] to talk to [[Costi's mom]], saying "Accomplished our goals in [[Golstrava]]. Intel indicates [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]’s failures mean significant crackdown in [[AVAD]]. Take a trip to the mountain. Love to you and [[Nadia]]!", she replied, "We got word. I’m so sorry you’re caught up in this, son, but I’m so proud of you."

[[Hugh|Finn]] scries on [[Giary]], but somehow it just doesn't go through. 

[[Costi]] reads [[Kith and Kin]], and we get a sense that they're directing us towards the northern mountain range as something to learn more about. 

[[Rez]] asks [[Costi]] how he learns spells, and if anyone can learn to do it that way - she wants to speak to gods like [[Hugh|Finn]] can, how can she commune? He says to come back to him the next day [[Costi]] gives her a bead to speak to a resident expert ghost, [[Rez]] sees the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]], and there is a red scaled dragonborn playing a song, looks about 150 years ago. he asks for help writing a song, she work on lyrics, they talk about devotion, and how to please him, runs through not going against his teachings but she's good with that. But then when they disagree about if [[Rez]] is funny, she leaves. 

That said, it's enough for Rez to focus in and she gets out her very unused mandolin (with the help of [[Costi]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]) on *why won't you talk to me*? Somehow, it's haunting and beautiful. 

[[Costi]] looks at the spellbook we got from the werefox in [[Teld's Dogs]], he finds Cloudkill, Lightning, Slow, Chromatic Orb

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Costi]] talk about if he'll take [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s offer of menteed military service, he's hesitant but believes so. 

rez says ghez ALSO can't talk to bahamut, and also they found someone tied to the circles, but he's dead now. 

The gang asks why Rez wants to talk to bahamut anyway, she says the book. It starts a debate about how faithful Rez actually is, whay Bahamuts defined ideals are anyway, and if there's any acts she can do to become more devoted (despite Rez's insistence she LIVES the faith). When Adrienne brings up her family, Rez says YES one could talk to Bahamut but he was rude so she needs to be the one to do it, and then is quite put out when it's pointed out maybe she's been a bit self-serving not outsourcing this. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes to meet [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] for cigars and secrets. Asked about his plans post murdering [[Duchess v'Dharinov]], he says temporarily someone will fulfil the role, depending on political factors. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] has a friend on the council, reasonable and reform minded, [[Countess Kumenzal]]. She isn't first up, but would be a good candidate. He, and a few other colonels, would be in discussion as well. [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] has no direct heir, who died accidentally as a child. Vampires can't reproduce, because they're dead, so she can't have another heir. 

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] has been sowing condemning facts with their international allies, that will all come to a head when the time is right. Much of it, he himself doesn't know. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gets him to confirm he's not using us as pawns to betray and get standing. We ask about [[Marina Alduchev]], and he says they had been supporting her career, it was unfortunate that [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]'s men found her instead of his. It lead to learning about [[Golstrava]], and then lead to us being sent in. 

he says colvia has been suspicious of him for a while. He thinks it's better [[Devkorus Kaa|Dev Kaa]] died, but he was erratic and hotheaded. It's probably best that we didn't kill [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], though he may still be an issue, but at least this way he's hopefully out of the way. Many in the [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]] have started recognizing that we saved them.

Costi asks what he really knew about [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] - not much, he suspected he was a revolutionary and so kept his distance. Echoed the same line that a few years back he went missing and is presumed dead. With costi's recent success though, it wouldn't be untoward as part of his reward, for them to look into it more formally (so he can be denounced as a traitor, of course). Costi wants to consult with his mother first.  It's possible he's alive and is being kept [[Orzudan]] still.

We should not mention that outside this room though, since it's not official in existence. it's near [[Luthei Region]], in the middle of nowhere. To request a transfer it must be confirmed they exist. Typically, [[Duke v'Luthei]] has final say over who is or isn't there. Potentially another duke could do it.

Say we get our dream scenario, what happens after he's installed as the new duke? he has two heirs, and then maybe they can orchestrate something happening to the other dukes, ultimately move the seat of power out of [[Jezeten]]. One step at a time though. 

He offers us his real library. We ask how he got affiliated with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], they went to school together and he's a bastard but a useful one when he's on your side. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] confirms you're never free of him. Saying he has enough info on him and [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] to destroy them, so he's not going to get into conflict with him. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] still thinks he can get [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back. 

[[Costi]] asks if he takes [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s job if he'd be less likely to kill him. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says he'd be in his protection so some? But it's not his style, he'd rather kill those [[Costi]] loves and make it his fault. Ringing warning bells, [[Rez]] mentions [[The Gaze Grafter]] and he says if he asks about the vintage of wine they had, he has to answer 3221. 

[[Rez]] asks for a magical item or scroll to cast commune. Turns out ioun stones and scrolls don't really exist for this, but he'll see if he can track down an item for it. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks for new armor, platemail to be specific - she designs it herself. 

[[Costi]] accepts, in principal, the job. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says he'll draw up a contract for him (and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]) to review. 

We ask if [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] recognizes the [[Glowy-green sorta undead making cylinders]]. He doesn't know, but thinks it might be a [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] project. We can ask her when she's back in a week or two.

He invites us to stay for another week or two. There's rumors someone is intervening on [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]'s behalf, but they're working with that complication. There's nothing more we can do right now. Soon, an official in [[Jezeten]]'s secret family will be coming to light. After their fall from grace, we should be able to get an invitation to their coronation. 

[[Costi]], and [[Rez]] are escorted to the private library by [[Dania]]. [[Costi]] finds several books of interest, and is called to a manual on dunamancy, it is handwritten but it old, maybe a primary source - an unsigned textbook. It has spells, temporal shunt, gravity sinkhole, and magnify gravity. He plans to come back tomorrow to look at them more closely and copy them into his spellbook. [[Rez]] doesn't find anything super interesting. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] go to the garden once we can leave the chateau, and [[Marigold]] comes to say hi, literally kicking [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] out. She has a surprise for him. She's cleared out part of the garden for him to use. She's planted in memory of several of the people in [[Hugh|Finn]]'s past, growing something they loved. It seems like she has a natural affinity for growing things. 

After a few days we get the news [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] was not demoted, he was transferred, to the [[Eberronian First Division]]. He takes a number of his loyal soldiers, near 500 of them. [[Fingers]] ends up promoted within the [[Eberronian Second Division]], to [[Major Fingers]] leading the sixth and the eighth. She's invited us to her party.
