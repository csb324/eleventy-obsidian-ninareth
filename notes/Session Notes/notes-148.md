# Detailed Notes: Session 148

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Father Thronestone]], "Can you make your way to [[Arkhosia (City)]] City? Say when you expect to arrive, I'll check in and we'll arrive that day. Too risky otherwise.", He responds, "Sure, it might be a few weeks. I’ll let you know when I leave, finishing an important commission."

On our second day at the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], we receive a note [[Jehneim Bastienev]] saying, "I understand you are not feeling well, and I'm sorry that the [[Turian Waste]] did not agree with your constitutions. However please at your earliest convenience come to us at the palace we would like to give you your earned reward. Respond via courier with 24 hours notice."

[[Hugh|Finn]] does some sendings:
* To [[Costi's mom]], "Following up on [[Elena]]. Did you happen to deescalate?", she replies, "Seems she was originally planning to be part of the… action the day you left. Thankfully, she had change of heart. Seems like nothing more."
* To [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]], "Hi checking where you are. Someone wants to murder us is walking around [[Eberron]]. [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]]? Avoid him if possible", she responds, "Oh I am long gone! Just a week away from [[Thelran Asari]], I’m planning to find [[Eirian]]!"

[[Freya]] burns [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]], it's an emotional moment for her. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] tries to divine truth from [[TrueSilver]], asking, "What is most important for us NOT convey to [[Colvia Ghul]] about the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]"? In the white flame, a flicker of what looks like a red dot for a moment, that crystallizes into a gem, suddenly it breaks and shattered and bursts into orange flame, a opening in the center of the white fire, before returning to normal. 

We decide this refers to [[Cinder]], the [[Ring of Efreet Summoning]], and the [[Fire Raisers]]. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] then tries to commune about [[Ioun]], 
* "Does the threat posed to [[Bahamut]], [[Pelor]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Moradin]] also put [[Ioun]] at risk?"
	* In a sense
* Would [[Ioun]] direct her devotees to try to work against those using the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]]
	* Doubtful
* Has something changed to prevent or reduce [[Bahamut]], [[Pelor]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Moradin]] ability to ask for help?
	* No

[[Hugh|Finn]] tries scries on a few people of note:
* [[Relakas]] - doesn't work
* [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] - He's walking outside on cobblestone, smiling - clearly in [[Jezeten]], likely the commerce district. He's in civilian clothes, no [[Zalev]] insignia, armed with spear and side sword. 
* [[Starstool Daygrip]] - He's in a room that is familiar to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] in [[Julian]]'s Chateau. He is in deep concentration translating [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s notes from a cipher and into letters. The one he is currently attempting to translate is to [[Mrs. Mosscreek]].

[[Hugh|Finn]] also does some private divinations, asking "I’ve been feeling lost a bit recently. Am I still doing the right thing?", throwing in the love letter from the [[Zhakastin Expedition]]. The flames rise up, silver, the warmth bathes over [[Hugh|Finn]] as he feels calm, centered, and right. Maintaining that warm feeling for the full duration of the magic. 

We go to give [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] a few updates, telling her [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] is here in plain clothes. She'll inquire about his purpose with some friends in [[Zalev]]. We express concern that he might hurt our reputation with the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] - she tells us not to do anything that would give credence to any of his lies. 

We discuss the summons, it's fine to wait a few days. Quite likely the meeting will include the [[Jehneim Bastienev]], [[Klodec Hyemagu]], and someone from the [[Eberronian First Division]]. Plus, we should expect [[Colvia Ghul]] very shortly after leaving their compound. 

[[Trisha]] comes to find [[Rez]], invites her to some target practice. She flirts, then checks in on how [[Rez]] is, asking for any more information that can help her research on the [[Boulder Makers]]. [[Rez]] shares [[Pleetos Alentas]]'s name and role in [[Thelran Asari]], that there's been ties to [[Durmask]], and [[Jalantar]]. She shares about the [[Unscaled]], and says she'll connect her sister. 

"[[Eirian|E]]! Friend of a friend can search [[Pleetos Alentas]]' house in [[Thelran Asari]], if he has. Connected to [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] -- they're mooooostly trustworthy? IDK connection though, be careful." She responds, "Copy. How do I get in touch?", [[Rez]] send, "I wasn't done, obviously. Same Satyr statue at the park, dusk? I'll just describe your weird little man to have them recognize you.", she responds, "Yep, thanks. Hope you don’t need that extra spell today."

[[Rez]] sends word to [[Trisha]] with that information. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] asks us to come and chat, greeting us with scotches (and one gin). We decide to finally tell the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] about the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]] and [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]. We give a background on [[Morthos]] and [[The Silver Hand]]. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] was absolutely weird about them. We cover [[Winifey]] and the [[Fire Raisers]]. 

We talk about any political play we could make with the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]], though they're not sure any would make much of a difference - plus it would set of [[Colvia Ghul]]. Hopefully we can take her out, when we complete [[A Murder of Dukes]], along with [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], and [[Nacrissa Thrudec]]. 

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] says it's often clear that we're still hiding information - so we should try to own up to as much of what we can. We should be forthright that we're withholding information, and we can provide information on the longer term if we have the chance to find it. 

The [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] say we should focus on one thing at a time, this first and then they'll try to help us with our world ending problem. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] asks to speak to [[Costi]] alone. 

He leads him through a series of hidden and magically protected rooms, including with blood magic, into a shrine to [[The Raven Queen]]. A massive raven skull serves as an alter in a room with the starry sky enchanted flooring. He says, welcome to Headquarters of [[the Matron's Conspiracy]], there's about 15, and offers him the chance to officially join, from his role of [[First Sword]]. 

He tells him to hold on tight, not letting go of the alter, and say "I swear to honor the moment" then runs him through. The blood pours down into the alter. Red feathers begin to appear, as though formed from [[Costi]]'s blood. 

As [[Costi]] feels his last drop of blood, his hand slacken - he can choose to pull back or hold on and let himself fall. He stays. 

He finds himself drifting through the void, before a voice ( [[The Raven Queen]]) rumbles through him, "The days ahead are dark, [[Costi|Constantine]]. Things are not as they seem. Those you wish to trust, must be questioned. We'll need discernment more now than ever. If you return, return and keep the moment pure. And keep the world together."

He says, "keep the world together?" as he is naturally ripped back into life. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says both he, and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]], died the first time through. He names him [[Unkindess Grosu]] and says he's officially one of them. There's only 15 or 16 of them, not associating often for obvious reasons. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] and [[Trisha]] are not involved. 

If [[Costi]] is lucky, maybe this process will happen to him again. Whatever [[The Raven Queen]] said, was meant for [[Costi]] specifically. He shares that some people he trust needed to be questioned, and that he should keep the world together. 

[[Costi]] asks if [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] is part of this, but [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says not officially - though he seemed to have a soft spot for [[The Raven Queen]]. He's also not associated with [[Pruvki Forgaveat]]. There's only the three of them in [[Eberron]]. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] keeps membership secret. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says [[Costi]] has earned this, and is truly, of the Conspiracy. [[Samuel]] speaks in common!! He's also been waiting for him to earn this. He says he's just a [[Watcher]], sort of an aspect of [[The Raven Queen]]. [[Costi]] asks where [[Samuel]] came from, he doesn't answer, says to talk to [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]]. [[Samuel]] says they don't have contact anymore, he "made his bargain". Not to assume too much, but [[Samuel]] feels like it would be rude to share anything else. 

[[Costi]] asks after [[A Murder of Dukes]] if he'd have a better opportunity to get to [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says hopefully - he imagines he's probably in [[Orzudan]]. 

[[Samuel]] says the [[The Nightmare King]] is a real problem in [[The Shadowfell]], he was deposed but is back in power. He could get [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] there, but it would take a while. Either through [[Kaycee Teapetal|Kaycee]] or through a site of immense tragedy, and there's a hundred or so through out [[Ninarith]]. 

[[Costi]] ends with a quiet moment to feel his connection to [[The Raven Queen]]. As he leaves, he feels [[Raven's Edge]] he can channel his energy to sprout black feathered wings, as a BA he can fly equal to movement speed for 1 min, equal to proficiency modifier per LR. 

[[Costi]] shares his religious overlap with [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] spends some time discussing if [[Kaycee Teapetal|Rez's Mom]] is a problem, [[Rez]] argues that there's bad undead and fine undead. [[Costi]] is skeptical, but when she argues both [[Kaycee Teapetal|Kaycee]] and [[The Raven Queen]] live in [[The Shadowfell]], and she'd definitely address it if she was an issue -- plus, she's a HERO, it settles. As long as [[Rez]]'s conversation redirection worked regarding what [[Kaycee Teapetal|Rez's Mom]] thinks of [[The Raven Queen]]. 

[[Freya]] goes for it, before getting distracted asking for Lendith. 

We send a note to the [[Jehneim Bastienev]], and she says the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] will see us at 2 tomorrow. We also send a note to [[Colvia Ghul]] that we can see her at brunch, she says it might be tricky and she'll get back to us. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] gets a visitor that afternoon, [[Gizulmood]] who is polite and seems to genuinely care about him. They have an extremely awkward chat, but he effectively swaps the new features into his old hand. [[Hugh|Finn]] gives him the empty older hand. 

The next day comes, we don't hear from [[Colvia Ghul]], and as we take our carriage to the palace. On the road, [[Costi]] gives us a boost. She ambushes us once we arrive, saying she let [[Jehneim Bastienev]] know we'd be 30 minutes late.
