# Detailed Notes: Session 142

As we edge around the lip of the glass mining chamber we can't help but see the smears and splashes of blood everywhere. As we approach the Overseer's Office, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is able to convince [[Bek]] to peek through the stone wall to see what's in there. He thinks it's empty. Also untrapped. 

[[Freya]] opens the door. It seems like an empty office, with a stone desk an carved shelves. We go in, closing and locking the door behind us. As we enter, we can see a knocked over chair with a dead draconic, throat cut. It's wearing a nicer, distinct uniform. [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] look through his things, finding a strange stone, in a crescent shape. He helps [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] go through the desk, finding a keyhole that seems to fit it perfectly -- revealing a secret compartment. Inside is correspondence to a secretary who works at forge in the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] for a master forger named [[Gaulthidak]], primarily haggling on price to purchase a large number of weapons, paying with goods from the mine, signed by [[Johviteo Bachekdem]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] thinks it was worth at least 4,500 PP. [[Rez]] picks up that [[Johviteo Bachekdem]] was perhaps more than just the overseer, seems to be too intentional or encoded, likely ties into something in [[Guâ€™athrithen]] - over the course of a year and a half, ending last 3 months ago. 

In the compartment, there is also a shard of a broken ruby. It doesn't seem likely the [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]] we found. There's no active magic on it, but there are signs that it might've been at one point. It seems like it was intentionally cleaved in two. [[Johviteo Bachekdem]] says it was [[Jalene]], in a ring she wore.

[[Hugh|Finn]] look at the body, and determines he was killed from behind with a single cut. 

[[Costi]] keeps his investigation streak going, and finds a hidden door in the bookshelf. It's fully caved in on the other slide, however. It's trapped, he tries to disengage it but instead is stabbed with a poison dagger. Once triggered, it's not inert and we open the area to investigate. We ask [[Bek]] to go look, it's a thick cave-in then comes out into the main mining chamber. 

As we prepare to leave the room, [[Hugh|Finn]] faintly hears something walk by the door. 

We enter the guardrooms, and see the bunkbeds stacked really really high, the ceilings about 30 feet tall. The skeletons are still there, frozen playing poker. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] feels another undead behind a pile of broken furniture. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] party preps for a fight while putting on a little bit of a show. The one we turned into a baby upstairs, pops out saying "we got em boys!". We are entirely unsurprised.

The Undead Formerly Known as Baby is a true nuisance. He, and the rest of them are re-deaded. [[Un-baby]] seemed pretty chill about his second death, and dissolved into dust immediately. Weird. 

We look through the room. Nothing is interesting about the poker table, there are no secret entrances to the room (we're SURE), and there's nothing really on the skeletons. Taking more time to look further, we find a jar. It appears almost empty, but we're filled with revulsion when we look at it, and the hazy essences that fills it. Shevashh is scrawled on the side. [[Bek]] says maybe it's translated water elemental language? THIS is how we find out he's a translator. It's a [[soul jar]]. [[Bek]] says they had one water elemental, making water, in the water room. 

[[soul jar]]
Fheug, an air elemental - steam engines
[[Shevashh]], a water elemental - water room
Li, ox - elemental in the entrance tunnels
Qa, ox - elemental in the entrance tunnels
One unnamed - [[Hugh|Finn]] thinks it may be elemental

Soul jars are evil, can be used to compel, influence, or even outright control a creature. They can risk destroying the soul entirely to release it too far from the creature it was captured from, especially if it's not from this plane.
