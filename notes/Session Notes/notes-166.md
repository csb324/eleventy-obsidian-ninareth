# Session 166

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Vask]], "Those revenant fucks are back. And they brought friends - those weird arm guys Mom always complained about?? We'll handle them but you owe me!!! Deck." he replies, "Ugh seems like they dropped a few things in here too! You handle the deck, thanks sis!"

We fight them off, [[Rez]] landing the killing blow on [[Ramara]] and [[Freya]] kills [[Davis]] by ripping off his wings. 

[[Vask]] says this happens every 6 weeks or so. Anything else we'll need to ask [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Eirian]], "E!!! [[Vask]] and I land tomorrow morning! Should we stay with you?? I'm bringing my people but Vask is leaving his behind. Soooo 6?", she replies, "Let me see what we have roomwise, but regardless we'll meet you at the Point! I cannot WAIT to see you."

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Dania]] before bed, "The stars are really pretty tonight. Wish you could see them on the airship. attacked by revenants. Everyone is okay. How is everything back home?", she replies, "Goodness! I'm glad you're okay, I'm sure you gave them what for. Good! Very busy, the meetings are endless, but it's nice."

We arrive in [[Thelran Asari]]!! The city has grown significantly in the last several hundred years, and seems to expand further every few years. It's the largest metropolitan area on the continent. We dock the airship at [[The Point]]. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] says goodbye to [[Magister]], planning to check-in later today - they will likely stay at [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]'s home. They give us each an access pass to move through the secure building. Meanwhile, [[Vask]] and [[Rez]] run down to greet [[Eirian|E]]. She greets our party by name each, and pointedly makes a connection with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], asking her to play music together.

[[Eirian]] introduces us to her party, [[Samson]] is wearing the most obnoxious outfit any of us have ever seen. He has a light blue wolf cut, it a little portly, covered in bright, moving, contrasting patterns, and wear white gloves. He's made flashcards of who everyone was in [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. [[Ghez Yhutl]] also surprises us by jumping out of a barrel, actually sneaking beyond everyone's awareness. Wow! 

We talk about where we'll stay, [[Eirian|E]] recommends [[The Solarian Respite]] where [[The Peaks]], [[The Heart]], and [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]] all intersect, and near where [[Eirian]] and her group are staying. [[Freya]] will likely be able to stay with the [[Wayfinders]] but it's unclear about [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. We choose to stay here for 3 nights, with 3 rooms, for 90gp. The front desk employee is [[Filben]].

[[Samson]] says he's happy to tell us more about [[Home]], lots of folks have had questions. More importantly, he's had a sense that all of us will be key in each other's lives, to [[Eirian|E]] and to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. 

We plan to walk through town towards this hotel and first and then get us in a secure room we can all talk. 

[[Vask]] goes back to [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] to be sure the [[Shard of Maguebliet]] makes it to the [[Niraani Sisterhood]]. 

We settle into the hotel and plan to meet up with [[Eirian]] and her group next.
