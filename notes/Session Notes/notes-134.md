# Detailed Notes: Session 134

We get back to [[The Compass Point]], debrief about the [[Pelor]] flyer. Then kill time until we get our dossier, from [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]:

* Over the last 9 months, the [[Gu’athrithen]] dragons have reported undead sightings in the [[Turian Waste]]. 
	* The first was in late Rolabloti (right before [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] met), and they reported it very quickly to [[Eberron]] who immediately disputed it.
	* Another late Yenti, a small attack, It intensified in recent months with dozens of other reports
	* Two and a half weeks ago, a gem mine about 35mi north of the [[Eberron]] border was overrun. One of those that only exists in the [[Turian Waste]] and overlaps with the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] ([[There's Plainly Something Wrong with the Planes]]). The death toll was about 380:
		* It was under fairly heavy guard, 80ish
		* About 300 miners from [[Gu’athrithen]], primarily blue draconics
* The attacks seem to stay within a 40 mi radius
* The most recent attacks have had no survivors, early survivors said zombies and skeletons
* There have been 11 groups of scouts from [[Gu’athrithen]]: 2 return finding nothing, 9 did not return
* Either the numbers are overwhelming or the type of undead has become more deadly

Goal questions: find out what is wrong, what is causing it, was [[Eberron]] responsible, is there a way to fix it?

The [[Turian Waste]] is semi-disputed, the entirety is claimed by [[Gu’athrithen]], other countries claim their own borders. If we are found by [[Gu’athrithen]] soldiers we will be consider unsanctioned. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] should be remained unnoticed by [[Gu’athrithen]]s leadership by any means necessary. We know they are fairly heavily patrolled, but think if we study their patterns we can work to avoid them. 

[[Deregheir]] hosted [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] when she was negotiating with [[Gu’athrithen]], there's a principal ambassador [[Jorun Lighthulv]], a silver scale in [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]]. They are purposefully distancing themselves from conflict with [[Gu’athrithen]]. 

It's clear the document is written so that whoever finds it, [[Eberron]] is clearly blameless. 

[[Rez]] sends to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], Hey girl hey - The dossier's useful! Any secret additions? Also, [[Burston Courtev]] tied to secret Pelor meet-up. You know of any ties? We're going to investigate!, she responds, "I’ll probably have a brief appendix when you leave, to be destroyed. On [[Burston Courtev]], none I’m aware of. Tread lightly, but could be interesting."

We try scrying on [[Burston Courtev]] but it doesn't work.

Scry on [[Ronan]]: Smiling and happy, well dressed, jewelry, sitting around a fire talking to a few other firbolgs near a town. After some time, buys some pitchers from the tavern. Not talking about anything of note, recounting a story. Multiple people involved, coming in and out. Hears the names / sees some people present: Morin, [[Balsandor]], [[Petra]]. [[Petra]] puts her hand on Ronin's leg.

[[Freya]] sendings to [[Rawley]], "Please I have to know. [[Polaris]] is on book page with “protective barrier” - is that what we should figure out? What is it? Please." He responds, "[[Freya]], you’re so close, but that ain’t how this works. I’m sorry, but once you can answer that question I can tell you more."

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gives us update about her middle brother [[Branthen Spout]], who wants to meet her in person, told her to find him at the [[Ku’norinth estate]]. 

We talk about how to communicate to [[Elena]] that she should target the forces that in their backyard, the [[Eberronian First Division]] and avoid more the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] [[Eberronian Second Division]]. [[Costi]] goes to talk to his mom at [[AVAD]].

[[Rez]], [[Freya]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] go shopping to get the recommended gear list for [[Who's Undead is That?]] and the [[Turian Waste]]. 

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] go to [[AVAD]] to speak with [[Costi's mom]] (he's ask for a scroll of sunbeam if she can help provide it) and meet his mage-pong coach [[Professor Vried Anglesmet]]. Interestingly, it seems like the mood has soured on [[Costi]]'s reputation. But his mood is lifted by a surprise party of his former teammates - there's cake and they play a few games. [[Rulyania Bvok]], who's two years younger than [[Costi]], follows him around - she was the first girl he ever turned down.   

We all reunite and get dressed nice for dinner at the [[Coldseeker Chateau]]. We're greeted by [[Coldseeker Chateau]], a nicely dressed human man, [[Aaeron Coldseeker]] an 8 year old little girl [[Hae Coldseeker]], and a 3 year old little boy, [[Kaftan Coldseeker]]. We learn their daughter is learning violin, and [[Freya]] tries to teach her to climb trees before we sit down for dinner. 

We're shown a 'secret' room with extremely expensive portraits - all non [[Eberron]], and interestingly, a previous general of [[Thelran Asari]] [[Mombant]] and a hero of [[Durmask]] [[Serana Veraxyes]]. [[Rez]] offers to buy the one of [[Serana Veraxyes]], it's one of 10 she ever sat for, and done by a famous artist of the time, he offers a price of 930 GP. He knows of an artist who did one of her brother too, one of only two not destroyed. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks where's he finding these masterpieces, a portrait dealer in a small shop in [[Tinkate]]. 

During dinner, [[Hae Coldseeker]] sneaks off with [[Freya]], showing her an actual secret tunnel through the grandfather clock, but she said she's never fully gone through it. She's seen her dad, [[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]], go in and out before. 

After dinner, they say we've been invited on a hunt - there's been a opossum problem and they come out at night. 50 GP to who ever bags the biggest. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] wins.

[[Rez]] sends to her guy to coordinate picking up the painting. They'll get it in a week and a half.

We try to scry on [[Burston Courtev]] again, no luck. Then look at [[Rughork]], and Finn sees a half-orc standing behind a bar, cleaning a pint glass. He's a dishwasher at [[The Ladies Breath]], a tankards kinda place. He genuinely seems like someone who is as he appears, not like a rich guy pretending. He looks pretty put upon and somewhat bitter, but does have an intensity about him. 

We discuss how to communicate with him, sending or asking a friend in [[Thelran Asari]] to go question him. We decide [[Rez]] will ask her sister, and [[Hugh|Finn]] will convey the message to him. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] helps us craft a scary message to [[Rughork]], [[Hugh|Finn]] sends, "We know what [[Sylvia]] did for you, but we have questions. You'll be paid double for answers. They'll find you. You're too smart to snitch.", he responds, "uhhh. Okay then."

When spend too long discussing how firbolgs fuck if they share cabins, and learn that there's a way to fuck while walking. There's about 500 people total in [[Polaris]].

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] comes to [[Rez]]'s room, she has a question, but not the fun kind. She wants to know about [[Rez's Family]], and says it's clear there's something she's not telling her. [[Rez]] agrees, referencing rules. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] offers her help, if she needs it. [[Rez]] says she appreciates that, and may take her up on it, but it would have to be without knowing anything. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks what [[Rez]] thought she was here for, and when [[Rez]] flirts, leaves with a "don't fuck with me [[Rez]]".

[[Hugh|Finn]] tries to scry on [[Burston Courtev]], and then readies to scry on [[Eirian]] as they go to interrogate [[Rughork]]. 

She sees [[Eirian]], [[Ghez Yhutl]], [[Samson]], and a dwarf with a crossbow named [[Ruby]]. When [[Eirian|E]] goes to ask for him, he says he's not in tonight. She sweet talks him into keeping the position open for him, they then split up to try and find out any information they can. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] borrows the [[Circlet of Sending]] to send to [[Branthen Spout]], each day. 

We go to scout out the [[Pelor]] meet up spot in the park, and notice a sun on a trapdoor in the gazebo. [[Hugh|Finn]] notices someone approach, see us, then leave. He trails them and finds a middle aged gnome. 

We plan to have [[Rez]] invisibly tail with an arcane eye going with her as back up. She preps with a disguise and a created [[Pelor]] holy symbol.

Freya is in a tree and sees [[Burston Courtev]] open the trap door. ([[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], performative authentically performatively performing the harp, individually, insight checks the people who walk by her, and the vibe is nervous and enjoying the night.

[[Rez]] heads in, 23, before moving down a staircase. It eventually opens into prayer room, with pews, that are beside brackish water giving off a rancid smell. [[Burston Courtev]] leads the congregation, telling them [[Eberron]] needs them, and maybe they clean up this place, there might be some dead bodies in the water here. 

[[Costi]] starts to wonder what's happening, but is able to determine through the eye that there is authentic [[Pelor]] worship happening here. What effect it's having though, is yet to be determined. Suddenly, stones slide and [[Eberronian Military]] city guards burst in and start arresting everyone. [[Burston Courtev]] gets freed, paid him, and the guards take three of the captured worshippers, dumping them into the goo. They immediately died. 

[[Rez]] tries to hold person him, but he resists, so she makes another double who tries to run from him while she makes our escape. [[Costi]]'s eye sees him pace and rant, we discuss if we should attack him now, as he begins to turn those bodies into undead.

We quickly prep ourselves. We see that as [[Burston Courtev]] begins casting, hundreds of fingers begin to appear from the goo. [[Freya]] throws the prepped fire ball as soon as she sees the monstrous undead amalgamation of bodies.
