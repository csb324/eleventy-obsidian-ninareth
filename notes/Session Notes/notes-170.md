# Session 170

[[Freya]] wakes up beside [[Zalvaris|Zalv]] in the [[The Silver Tongue]]. [[Zalvaris|Zalv]]'s room is covered in weapons, and all of them look augmented - runes or gemstones. He talks her through a number of their stories and how he acquired them. She's earns the right, or rather annoys him into complying, to borrow [[Sali]] for the [[Boulder Makers Counterattack]]. 

She talks to him about he's doing - terrible. He wasn't even aware of mortality as a real thing, to losing all of his closest family. He's not alone, but he is. He's already drinking. 

He's secretly glad [[Zmaj]] is such a stick in the mud, because someone has to be the responsible one. [[Rez's Family]] needs it, along with [[Li]]. Though it's sort of the difference between protective older brother and second dad? He says that [[Bhula Orbnose]] is his to kill. 

She brings up the [[Planes of existence]], he talks about visiting [[Aedara Alinar|Aedara]], [[Kaycee Teapetal|Kaycee]], and [[Gemma]] - he got to throw things at [[Tiamat]]. He could bring her next time. He does remember someone saying something similar to [[Synchrona]] up in the north, around 150 years ago. Either a cloud or storm giant. Turns out it wasn't too far from [[Polaris]]. 

They plan to meet up again that night. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries her best to sneak away from [[Rez]]. She wakes her up. [[Rez]] asks her to stay, but she sneaks out anyway, saying "we're not supposed to be roommates... we'll talk tomorrow"

[[Eirian|E]] sendings to [[Rez]] "when you're done with your morning distraction, come to [[The Silver Tongue]]", she replies "Go away... okay". 

[[Rez]] heads out to meet her siblings. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Costi]], and [[Hugh|Finn]] meet for breakfast. [[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] try to get [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to open up. Good luck. [[Freya]] joins and reminds [[Costi]] to talk to [[Zalvaris|Zalv]]. Then takes her own stab at asking [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] about [[Rez]]. She slips up calling [[Rez]] a coworker, everyone pounces. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] relents the tiiiiniest amount, saying sometime it isn't it best to act on your impulses. She's regretted almost every time that she did give in. [[Freya]] tries to tell her that she's smart about what she wants, so if she wants [[Rez]], maybe she should just let herself have her. 

[[Costi]] breaks to ask [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] for advice, "Mom, weird question... what was that thing you used to say about being open with your friends? [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] likes [[Rez]] but won't talk to us.", she replies, "We only get through this hard life relying on those who love us. We do a disservice to them by hiding what we need."

[[Freya]] opens up herself, about her own experience about falling in love and how scary it is (not that her take worked out well) but she does know about relationships and is there for [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to talk. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] pulls [[Freya]] for a chat, telling [[Hugh|Finn]] that he thinks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is not the type to respond well to being pushed, but [[Freya]] thinks it's good for her.

[[Rez]] makes it to breakfast with her siblings. She tries to get reviews of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. Everyone's a fan. [[Zalvaris|Zalv]] warns that if [[Freya]] tries to run away with his ax he'll kill her. 

Tomorrow, [[Eirian|E]], [[Vask]], and [[Rez]] will take our people on a boat to [[Fenswick Cove]]., about an hour and a half. We should meet at the [[Captain's Wharf]]. We will be seen approaching but that is part of the plan. [[Zmaj]] and [[Zalvaris|Zalv]] will sneak by land undetected. 

[[Vask]] and [[Eirian|E]]'s group will go into the tunnels that lead to a store room. After the main room there's a few chambers that takes a lift down to the main area. They'll go into the storerooms and attack from behind with more resistance. They'll attack first and try to stay there.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] will go through the front directly into the main chamber. [[Zmaj]] and [[Zalvaris|Zalv]] will join us there. 

They use our bodies to make themselves stronger, [[Bhula Orbnose]] has a necklace will several scales, one will glow with each casting and it makes the magic stronger. Chromatics and metallics parts alike. 

They have counterspell, even from non-casters. They know [[Bhula Orbnose]] was seen there, [[Pleetos Alentas]] may be, along with [[Nebrur Sunbreaker]] and [[Zilbar Saplegople]]. We want to take at least a few alive. There's at least 40, but up to 150 could be there. 

[[Zmaj]] has spoken with the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Thelran Asari]], they're conducting an investigation but at least a few there know of our situation. They're given us some materials, 300gp each.

They're not sure how they're keeping some dragons in their forms. [[Nehushta|Neti]]'s boulder was shattered. We're not sure what happened, but she did walk specifically walk into a trap - she was targeted. [[Zoheret|Zoha]]'s boulder was saved, and is in [[Durmask]]. She was chipped but not fully broken. 

It's not clear we're the line is between the [[Unscaled]] and the [[Boulder Makers]]. 

We all confirm we haven't talked to [[Azir DarAxia|Rez's Dad]]. [[Zmaj]] says [[Aedara Alinar|Aedara]] seems to be working on it, but we have to remember that could vary wildly based on when she thinks it is. [[Rez]] says she told [[Kaycee Teapetal|Kaycee]]. [[Zmaj]] tells [[Eirian|E]] to send [[Samson]] to tell [[Gemma]]. We're worried but only so much. 

[[Rez]] tells [[Eirian|E]] to lay off [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], she's a shit about it. [[Zmaj]] makes her agree to at least wait to run a hand down her back as she walks by until AFTER the [[Boulder Makers Counterattack]]. [[Eirian|E]] seems to clock something, [[Rez]] is unrepentant. 

[[Rez]] makes the group chat end by having a group hug. She and [[Vask]] then blow all of their money gambling. Then they go and buy potions. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] meets back up. Those of us with counterspell practice being able to see dispel magic. [[Rez]] asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to keep an eye on [[Zmaj]], since he's the type for heroic sacrifice and also has already lost. 

We share the various lore we all received. Then head back to the [[The Silver Tongue]]. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] spends some time with [[Zmaj]], bringing him a cup of tea. [[Zmaj]] asks for his help reading the ground and the maps. [[Hugh|Finn]] is naturally helpful, but also is able to tell he's getting a task to help with anxiety, but [[Zmaj]] also needs some connection himself. [[Zmaj]] offers to scry on [[Bhula Orbnose]] tonight, and ask [[Hugh|Finn]] to try on a sketch on a dwarf (her too). 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] goes to find [[Eirian]]. That bitch definitely trails down her side. They talk magical musical shop, and [[Eirian|E]] tries to show her how to use the mage hand - also showing off her flute from a friend of [[Aedara Alinar|Auntie A]]. Over the course of the two hours they talk, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] notes that [[Eirian|E]] has been paying extra intentional attention to her. She changes her mind from thinking she's being made fun of, it's clear she thinks a lot of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. They have a moment of game recognizing game, though [[Eirian|E]] take steps slightly too far, kissing [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] on the cheek with just enough intention. 

[[Costi]] finds some disguise self scrolls, with the help of [[Rez]]. Then, he goes to find [[Zalvaris|Zalv]] for info on [[Synchrona]]. He spent a few decades in the Eastern [[Ragndaar Mountains]]. [[Costi]] thinks both this could be real and true, even likely, but it's still wildly unhelpful. The most noteworthy thing is that it's tied to either cloud or storm giant. 

[[Costi]] joins [[Zmaj]] and [[Hugh|Finn]]. He talks some strategy, talking through a few ideas. [[Costi]]'s idea of scattering people through his arcane eye outside the compound leads to [[Pik]] and [[Pak]] planning to take out stragglers near camp. He also shares the alter self plan, [[Zmaj]] plans to have [[Samson]] and [[Ghez Yhutl]] do the same. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Dania]], "How was your day? I’ve felt a little down….? Over the last few days. wish we could talk for more than 25 words. It would help", she replies, "I'm sorry, Finn. My day was nice, we negotiated an excellent trade deal with [[Nervart]]. I would like to speak at greater length, as well."

That evening, when we're all together, [[Freya]] gets her revenge shot, perferctly nailing his left butt cheek. He threatens her with a bullet to hold onto for future placement in her chest. She eats it. Told ya.

[[Zmaj]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] both scry on [[Bhula Orbnose]], doesn't work for [[Hugh|Finn]], nor on [[Pleetos Alentas]]. 

[[Freya]] then goes to spend the night with [[Zalvaris|Zalv]]. 

[[Costi]] sends:
* [[E]] - "Hey if tomorrow goes well, can you help my sister get into the [[Niraani Sisterhood]]?" She replies, "sure". 
* [[Nadia]] - "Hey, doing cool thing later, maybe can get you into [[Niraani Sisterhood]]. If it goes well." She replies, "I don't need your help, but thanks"

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] messages to [[Rez]] "You're not going to die tomorrow", "No one is. Right?" "Right. No one is, not if we can help it."

Late night anxiety brings [[Rez]] to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s door, saying "we don't have to be roommates... but tonight can I just stay?" She relents.

We wake up and head to the [[Captain's Wharf]].
