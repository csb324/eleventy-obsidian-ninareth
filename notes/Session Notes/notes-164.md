# Session 164

[[Freya]] makes a laxative.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sends to [[Starstool Daygrip]], "Hey! Got anything on [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]]? We’re Getting him out of [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]]’s way. don’t mention to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] — I’ll give you credit when it works." He replies, "Oh I've seen that file! Sure, let me track it down, I'll send you something in a few hours." 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talks with [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] a bit about her complicated thoughts on him, she half wants him as a spy, half wants to benevolently kidnap him for his own good. 

[[Starstool Daygrip]] comes back clutch, "1. J used him traffic contraband before. Done for others, J plays it now. Mostly regionally illegal goods, specifically controlled spell components. Can get you dates." [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] thanks him, "You’re the best, starstool. That’s fantastic. well done."

[[Hugh|Finn]] got [[Terrav]]'s possessions from [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], some gold, a crossbow and bolts, his clothing, and a gold chain he wore. 

[[Vorpos Glitterdrop]] sends us a party carriage pick us up, with champagne and caviar. He's an older gnome, in a loud purple suit, flecked with silver, and a blue bolo tie. He wears a lot of jewelry, and maybe also lifted shoes. 

He's bending over backwards to kiss our asses. Asks for our favorite foods, defers to our preferences, even changing the music in the ballroom to the song [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] transposed as her senior solo and won a prestigious award for. 

[[Vorpos Glitterdrop]] shows [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] off in a very well choreographed dance to show off his best attributes without outright supporting his bid for Duke. He pretty heavily insinuates that we might find more benefit meeting and becoming with the friends here than other places. He outright mentions an upbringing like [[Costi]]'s to focus on their similarities. 

[[Rez]] asks him for more information on his work, he shares his background and the now very successful trading business. He has traded in everything but now focuses on luxury goods. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] small talks, while [[Freya]] terrorizes, a wood elf couple names [[Norza]] and [[Denithor]]. She offers to make custom fashion for both them, as they do bespoke clothing. They only ask that the two of them wear whatever they make for the coronation of the new Duke (their mutual friend, I'm sure) and say the [[Winterseekers]] made it.

We learn that most merchants, and many of the reformers are supporting [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]]. They've heard some disturbing rumors of what happened under the [[Stormwall district]]. It's increasing the urgency of some of the reformist candidates. They think a financial path would open up the liberties being harmed, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] leans in on knocking down trade barriers. [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]] is struggling more in the military minded population. Almost everyone in attendance has a direct business relationship with [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]].

[[Rez]] gets tour of some of his art collections, describing her priorities (important from the past or will be important in the future). He shows some typical but boring pieces, but does have [[Josh|Jinx]] first lute - [[Rez]] buys it on sight. (700 GP)

He dances around collecting important religious relics, [[Rez]] bites immediately and shares that she likes her things and thinks she deserves to have them. He's in. 

* [[Krummyr’s Screaming Sword]]: A mounted sword dripping blood - belonged to oracle warlord about 150 years ago, against [[Haag Kitot]] named [[Krummyr]], it hurts to wield 
* Nondescript pouch - belonged to [[Yosgrim Longriver]] about 800 years ago, always has just what you need, followed [[Glittergold]]
* Chunk of obsidian - a familiar of a high priestess of [[Lloth]], named Diaferous, approximately 1000 years ago, who 
* Crescent moon wand - a devotee of the goddess of seas, a weather control device. 
* [[Tiamat Scale]]: belonged to [[Rhularta]], but seems sapped of power now. Large red dragon scale 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Victoria Several|Victoria]], "Hi! I have a gift for you!! Well, I could buy it and you could help? A BLOOD MAGIC SWORD, Krummyr’s Screaming, in fact. 39,000?" she responds, "Sure, that works. We should come into some money in two days."

[[Rez]] gives a down payment of 5k. The scale is 97k, which is a little rich even for her blood. She sends to [[Li|Igolide]], "I FOUND ONE OF [[Tiamat]]'S SCALES. Scumbag in [[Jezeten]], seems defunct? BUT we shouldn't let this be, right?? 97k. [[Vask]] and I kinda... need money?", he replies, "Name and location, please. I'll see to it, we'll handle it subtly.", [[Rez]] pouts but then relents, "Fine. But I get to keep it for a while, FINDER'S KEEPERS. [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]], *address*, in the basement. Go quick, he's in trouble soon." He ends, "Good work."

Upstairs, [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is really being ourselves. [[Freya]] teaches some people a bit of hand to hand combat.  [[Hugh|Finn]] is looming over [[Costi]]'s shoulder, unintentionally adding the intimidation he needs to snoop out some new info.  

Eventually, we all group up together at [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]]'s request to talk about the bid for Duke. He makes a pitch for business and industry leading the way for [[Jezeten]], rather than the traditional military style of [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] grills him a little, on his thoughts for the [[Stormwall district]] and undead, and his answers are fine. 

We go home and catch each other up on our various intel. 

In the morning, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] has another chat with [[Hugh|Finn]]. It seems [[Rez]]'s talk of her hoard, and her desire to have important things from her lived experiences, prompted him to look at his own collection. He's added [[Terrav]]'s necklace. [[Hugh|Finn]] says it has not been easy for him to live a long time. They both lament their time away from their gods, and would like to leave [[Jezeten]].

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes to get clothes from the [[Winterseekers]]. They promise to have clothes for us before we leave. 

We fill in [[Trisha]], who says they may not need to ruin his life now, they can just blackmail him. They'll wait until we get the sword, and then they'll twist his arm to drop out. We may not have a friend anymore, but we did our job! 

That evening, we head to the [[Commerce district]] for dinner with [[Vragar Aldea]]. The whole family greets us, [[Vragar Aldea]], his wife, Melidia, [[Marius A]], and [[Elena]]. Luckily, [[Costi]] is 'NOW over it'. So thank goodness for that. 

[[Marius A]] is covered in scars from his [[Colvia Ghul]] interrogation. It's a grim sight. They're welcoming though, and open their home for us to chat before dinner. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] pulls [[Elena]] aside for a minute. They chat a bit about the happenings of the [[ELA Day of Action|Day of Storms]], and the hard but improving times they're in. [[Elena]] asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to share what happened to [[Marius A]], saying that he doesn't want to talk about it. [[Hugh|Finn]] doesn't give much away. [[Elena]] finished her degree, and is considering additional study - [[Hugh|Finn]] encourages the [[The Academy in Thelran Asari]].

[[Elena]] asks [[Costi]] for a chat before dinner, and takes him up to her room. She has a magic nondetection sigil from [[Marius Lupu]], so they can talk freely, but it only works once. She grabs two bottles of gin and apologizes for how she'd been acting. She was unsure if she could trust [[Costi]], and wanted to get involved, though no one would fully let her in. 

She confesses she knows he "saved the city, and not in the way people think". She's sorry for doubting him, and says she helped the [[AVAD]] students put together the anti-[[Costi]] banner.

[[Elena]] says [[Vragar Aldea]] is pretty close to dropping out, he's mostly running out of a sense of duty. She hopes [[Costi]] can push it in the right direction, and an offer from a potential candidate could be enough. 

[[Costi]] catches [[Rez]] up, and asks her to send to [[Trisha]], "We got him!! [[Vragar Aldea]] near dropping out, according to [[Elena]]? Maybe if promised a sweet totally important good for [[Eberron]] gig? We can do it!", she replies, "Sure, go for it. Imply we have something, and we'll be in touch. Nothing specific, but dangle something."

[[Costi]] floats something aligned to the head of the guards, [[Vragar Aldea]] says [[Sylgeiros Crimsonmane]]'s people offered a similar deal. But he'd be open to another offer. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] backs this up, and [[Vragar Aldea]] says he'd be happy to talk to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] - he's had a long working relationship with [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] as well. 

[[Marius A]] also pulls [[Costi]] aside to tell him that the [[Eberronian Second Division]] offered him a new role, a captain position in the High Grounds. [[Costi]] encourages him to take it, saying the [[Groups and Organizations/Burbanks|Burbanks]] are good people. He thinks it aligns with what [[Marius A]] wants for this city. [[Costi]] guides without revealing anything, and they agree there is still a lot of work ahead. 

[[Rez]] gets her packaged 'gift' for [[Victoria Several|Victoria]], the [[Krummyr’s Screaming Sword]]. [[Costi]] gets gassed up by [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], who has to touch this item in order to learn about it's magical ability. He withstands the pain, and the blood from the blade starts reversing the drip and trying to force itself back into your body. It hurts a lot. 

[[Li|Igolide]] sends to [[Rez]], "It has been taken care of", she replies, "And on the way to my riiiiiight?". He shuts her down, "it will be taken care of in [[Deregheir]]"

[[Vorpos Glitterdrop]] leaves the race. Shortly after, [[Vragar Aldea]] does too. They both endorse [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]/

[[Magister]] sends to [[Hugh|Finn]], "Apologies for any potential inconvenience, we're ([[The Silver Halves]]) arriving early. We'll be in tonight if you can make yourself available." He replies, "I suspect if [[Rez]] finds out we won't have much of a choice"

[[Magister]] tells "we've arrived, they have home for us in a inn in the [[Duchal District]], if you'd like to come - here's the address"

[[Vask]] greets [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], and is very himself: hugs [[Rez]], rubs in his multi-year poisoning of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], threatens to shoot [[Costi]], grinning all the while. 

[[Magister]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] reunite, he's thrilled to see him fully whole. 

[[Victoria Several|Victoria]] gets the [[Krummyr’s Screaming Sword]], and attunes to it right away. We plan to introduce her to [[Trisha]]. And it turns out she's worked with [[Vorpos Glitterdrop]], but he's clearly been holding out on her. 

[[Vask]] recommends that [[Costi]] check out a Ruby and Gold Amulet (the [[Amulet of the Planes]]) from the Mummy Lord [[The Silver Halves]] killed. [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] says she doesn't want to sell it if it's SUPER dangerous. 

[[Magister]] gives us the money [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] owes us, in a [[Bag of Holding]]. It's ours too! 

[[Vask]] shows [[Rez]] the secret item they were commissioned to go get, a [[Shard of Maguebliet]]. He doesn't know who requisitioned them, but [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] says she's going to take it to the [[Niraani Sisterhood]]. [[Rez]] and he debate taking it themselves, but agree to take it together and tell them to save it in case [[Rez's Dad|Azir]] or [[Aedara Alinar|Aedara]] come get it.
