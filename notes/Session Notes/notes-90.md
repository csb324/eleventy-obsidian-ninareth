# Detailed Notes: Session 90

We immediately search the room, we notice [[G'zraad]]'s body disintegrates, except for his two golden fingers. We take his ashes and those fingers.

Looking at the root where [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] emerged, and where the void used to be, we see strange symbols carved into the bark. They're in a tight geometric shape, with clearly seen lines along the bottom and sides, making a tapering trapezoid shape. The one at the top is [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]], and in the center of that shape there is a dull red stone, it is similar to the [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]] but has no magic coming out of this, unlike the ruby eye. It crumbles into dust when touched, and [[Costi]] collects the debris. Behind the root there's a small panel, we move a hidden panel to see a dark tinted pane of glass, looking closely we see some sigils behind it showing it to maybe be a [[sending panel]] - we fiddle until a message appears. None of us can read it, so we copy it down to read later. After a SR, [[Costi]] reads the message in DeepSpeech saying, 

"[[G'zraad]] - Your progress—finally—is encouraging. Our window appears to be Riventi, do not fail to take advantage of [[Weirefesteria]]’s latent power again. We are most vulnerable in Marcanti; expect a concerted effort to undo your work then. [[Mhrhaal]]’s efforts appear to be moving apace, and mine, as you are well aware, have been established for the last year. Our southern friend and their long-shot attempt has been, unfortunately, unmade. To assist you in your efforts, we have provided one of [[Bhuldikat]]’s spawn; keep it alive. It also bears another gift, it should jumpstart your stalled workings. Do not fail this time, [[G'zraad]]. - [[Sezathkathon]]" [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]

Looking around we find a small underdark wyrmling that had been dissected, it's blind. All of it's inner organs have been fully removed. Must mean that [[Bhuldikat]] is maybe an underdark dragon himself? 

[[Freya]] goes to speak to the anchor tree, hoping it feels better and asking if it recognizes the symbol. She feels a warmth through it, and is overwhelmed with it's gratitude. It pops off the sigils in the trapezoid as a sheet of bark we can keep. 

We give [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back her things and decide to try and rest where [[The Burning Sons]] did, hoping we won't be bothered by any lingering undead, and [[Jade]] begins interrogating her. We get her to try and write down her questions instead. In our resting area, we start to catch her up, but she's not at her mentally sharpest. in the midst of our conversations, she hears [[The Curator]] say "welcome back" and she attempts to close that mental connection. 

[[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] asks what [[Freya]] knows about the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] symbol around [[Bagath Mizzragon]]'s neck. [[Freya]] shares about finding the note from [[Polaris]] and says she's been searching for answers the last 2 years. She asks her to keep it a secret as much as she can, and that we've found it in places with other undead. [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] says she'll tell [[The Matron]] in case it connects to a future threat against [[Izdeke]]. [[Freya]] spirals a bit about whether or not the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] are attached to something bad, and what that means for her potential involvement in it. We all caution her to be careful on reaching out to [[Skiv]] or [[Rawley]]. 

On their watch [[Costi]] and [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] share commiserations about their fathers, and [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] hopes [[Costi]] doesn't have to deal with what she did, but if he does, that he can also bring his father to peace.

In the morning, as [[Costi]] prepares his glimpses of the future ahead, he sees blood where he hadn't before, then sees [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] dead at his feet, then a totally different vision of us fine, then flashes of new visions until he notices a tremor of purple running down [[Raven's Edge]]. He feels a different connection to the future than what he's previously felt, and as he looks at his spell book he notices entirely different spells than before. Less about noticing the future and more about altering it. 

We do our best to sneak our way back to [[Izdeke]], we pass by many many undead bodies. When we make it back, [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] says she'll talk to [[The Matron]] first then they'll come get us. 

[[Costi]] opens up that he thinks he fundamentally changed how he touches magic when he chose the future that brought [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back, but it's changed most of his spells and he thinks he may have changed entirely. It seems like most of it is now chronomancy and dunamancy. 

We catch [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] up on more of what she missed, and [[Rez]] brings up that maybe we should ask [[The Matron]] to connect to the [[Gia'Thoren]] for help getting back to [[Quaath]]. 

We're escorted to talk to [[The Matron]], she thanks us for saving [[Izdeke]] and bringing peace to [[Bagath Mizzragon]]. She asks for any more information that might be helpful, we clarify that there's other sights we've found them. We ask about [[Bhuldikat]], they haven't heard that name but know of underdark dragons. They've haven't been seen in a few hundred years, the last they heard of them was during [[Tiamat]]'s Second Ascension. 

[[Sanctuary Amulet]], resist necro, cast spare the dying BA, 1 per day creature within 60ft react to activate and goes to 1 - carried by [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]
[[Ring of Free Action]], no difficult terrain, no magic paralyze restrain or reduce movement - carried by [[Freya]]

They offer to connect us to the [[Gia'Thoren]], and agree to keep [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s name not shared publicly. They say they're also making sure [[The Burning Sons]] ambush us in the tunnels. [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]] says she's going to find [[Sezathkathon]], but will first go to see [[No-Karo]] in [[The Tendrils]]. [[Jade]] latches on. She trades mauls with [[Freya]] before leaving. 

We spend the next two days allowing [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to recover and enjoying [[Izdeke]] in a more free way. 

[[Hugh]] "Do I know the person that dropped the 5th touch" "no", "Are [[Sienna Burbank]] and [[Cliff Burbank]] the best option for getting my memories back" "they're certainly a path", "will getting my memories back do more harm or more good?" "Your path is yours to walk"

[[Freya]] sendings to [[Skiv]], "I'm so sorry for how things turned out, I counted you as a trusted friend, even if it was new and I know that might not still be the case for you", she responds, "As far as I'm concerned, no harm no foul."

[[Costi]] sendings, "Hey [[Magister]]. My divination magic is maybe now dunamancy? It feels like it's time related. Do you have any expertise? I'm unsure what happened. Thanks, [[Costi]]" he replies, "Ah. Welcome to the club [[Costi|Constantine]]. My forte is gravitational magic, but I dabbled in time. We should talk, you and I. Sincerely, [[Magister]]"

[[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] leads us to the royal secret staircase that they use as a safe direct route to above ground. We make it, and land in the [[Liveth forest]]. We say our goodbyes to [[Jade]], and head towards the closest [[Gia'Thoren]] outpost about two days north. 

Almost immediately, [[Freya]] finds a [[Wayfinders]] path that moves us through. We move stealthily to get us through the forest. We find a marked cave to rest for the night. 

As [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is on watch someone sneaks up on her and tells her to wake our leader, "isn't it obvious? The scaled one" - it's [[Zmaj]]

His squadron, [[Belas Kinklan]], an elven fighter, [[Belatar Aeleth]] a burly human, [[Shalak Devaran]] an elf in robes, [[Ravona Silentreed]] the druid are all set off to secure the area and set up defenses, the rest of his [[Gia'Thoren]] team. He is very condescending and scolds us on letting our guard down, then reveals he weekly scrys on [[Rez]] and [[Vask]] to make sure we don't endanger the family. We end up talking about [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and [[Vask]] and learn he's been working on poetry, doesn't seem like she's fully convinced on him. This is good intel. We go back to sleep and say we'll talk through the rest in the morning.

[[Rez]] flaunts what we've done, and says that he'll give our introductory letter to his commanding officer. Asking about his party, we learn they're from the army. [[Rez]] tells him about the [[Bahamut]] party, their oracle, and [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]]. He shares his own updates -

[[Zmaj]] tells us that one of the grafted might have been operating in [[Ru'Nileth]]. The only found blood, and a few mutilated corpses, but no scales - just diagrams. He's also heard rumors, it seems like it's spread and is talk of "putting down" new draconic creations, they call themselves [[Boulder Makers]]. 

Kansi is working through [[Gia'Thoren]] entry level training. have a smuggling ring in [[Tinkate]], Cordelia is in [[K'falgaard]]. [[Simin]] and [[Taji]] have been moping, they had a business venture that failed. 

We say we're trying to get back to [[Quaath]], [[Zmaj]] says he could help if we owe him a favor, [[Freya]] says she talked to the anchor tree. We agree to this request, after [[Rez]] says he'd only ask for something good for the fate of the world anyway. We talk briefly, and agree going to [[Ru'Nileth]] would be important - [[Freya]] wants to check on the [[Wayfinders]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] wants to potentially see her family. 

We start to make our way to the next [[Gia'Thoren]] outpost, [[Zmaj]] is unwilling to to travel with us, he has to watch us to be sure we'll survive.
