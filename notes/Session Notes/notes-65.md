# Detailed Notes: Session 65

We head to [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]] to do recon on [[The Raven Queen]] and death workers in general. We hop on the flyteway, where they end up offloading everyone to do a search of the train, who seem to search for bombs. 

We make it to the bookstore, we look for books about [[The Raven Queen]] in the modern era, deathworking introduction, brief history of [[The Raven Queen]]. [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] find a biography titled [[Viardel Brensaschi]], which seems to be a matron of [[The Raven Queen]], who is the head of the order, died about 40 years ago. We also find a general guide called [[The Ascended]], with intros to the modern cults of the Ascended Gods. [[The Raven Queen]]'s disciples are called the [[Death's Watchers]]. We also find a book on the general practices of preparing bodies for the after life. 

[[Costi]] tries to borrow knowledge from someone who knows about [[The Raven Queen]]'s burial rights, but he seems to find a halfling with ties to [[Yondala]] instead. [[Jade]] goes to talk to [[Kildee]], he recommeds a background on the buildings in the city [[Arkhosian Architecture: A Journey Through the Ages]] and some [[Arkhosia (City)]] records as well, which include some old blueprints for famous places in the city:  the main receiving hall of the [[Suncrest Palace]] and the [[Halls of the Dead]]. 

We buy all of these books. [[Costi]] is offered a job again. He also gives us a parcel of books to give to [[Welcome]] again.

We go back to the [[Chapel of the Lost]] to start our homework, but first goes to impress [[Welcome]] with wrist pocket. A fullproof plan. 

While the studious members of the group read, [[Freya]] starts a discussion on how to keep [[my hole]]. We think about perhaps using Nystul's Magic Aura on some similar fabric? Or maybe just keeping it until they're too arrestsed to complain.

[[Jade]]'s reading shows that the [[Chapel of the Lost]] was once completely empty to honor [[Kelemvor]]'s worship of the void and nothingness. When reading about the [[Halls of the Dead]], portions are redacted but we learn that the first floor is public. There is a separate lift to go both up and down, administrative lift starts on the second floor and the same for the cypts below. There are several recipts, with the personal information is redacted but [[Jade]] glasses flash and clear the redaction ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]) but she sees [[Heestal Eeping]], 36. [[Jade]] also looks for any other similar documents, and she thinks she's found some internment records. 

[[Costi]] learns that [[Viardel Brensaschi]] was the most recent former [[Matron of Ravens]] who is the official cult leader of [[The Raven Queen]]. There's not really a home base, they're nomadic and relatively unpopular, but they all almost have martial training as one of their two primary goals is the destruction of all undead. She lived most of her life in [[Eberron]] were she was highly hunted by the state. She was succeeded by her first disciple, [[Kan Gluknan]], a hobgoblin. She was from [[The Tendrils]], ravens followed her, she was kicked out of her town as a child and eventually was taken in by the cult. She was a prolific vampire hunter, and the book takes credit for the murder of [[Count Hisir Rorsik]] which was infamous in [[Eberron]]. 

We talk about what to discuss with [[Winifey]]. In order not to spook her, we decide to update [[Ellinev Del]] - [[Hugh]] sendings to her "Update: delved Union [[Copper Mines]] for [[Fire Raisers]] Beholder and durguar guarding rock - bomb? Durgaur good. [[Fishermen]] and [[Fire Raisers]] stole blubber shipment. Related? Meeting tonight donâ€™t follow", she replies, "Thank you, don't leave your room in the next hour. In 45 min, order soup".

A bellhop shows up, removes an illusion and reveals it's [[First Officer Ghent]]. We tell him vaguley about lunch: we met with leadership, but didn't give names, it was at [[Flounder's]]. We say some of the unions are involved, and some of the mining families, but it's unclear if it's by choice or forced. We also confirm the [[Jalantar]] and [[Arkhosia (City)]] [[Fire Raisers]] are working together.

We give details on the mine trip too. [[Costi]] says we were about 4,000 ft deep. We told the carts were used, and it goes to the [[Copper Foundry]]. We also tell that the [[Fire Raisers]] are working with the [[Fishermen]], and they're contract based but we don't have the best contacts - we're working on that though. [[First Officer Ghent]] asks if we're doing any crimes soon so they can get us out and back on the case if we're arrested. [[Rez]] asks if it's illegal to fight with people if they ask for it? And he says yes the [[Bloody Waters]] are illegal but they'll not raid it tomorrow. [[Costi]] asks if there's anything else we should do in our work with the [[Fishermen]], [[First Officer Ghent]] says if we see [[Dharbeed Tzaavi]], a big darker skinned human with a large beard, relatively high up and a bad man. They've been trying to nail him for a while. If we get information that would be helpful. 

We head to the [[Silver Pike]] to meet with [[Winifey|Winnie]]. We recap the [[Copper Mines]] for her, and learn that [[Rhene Blackstone]] is not working with them anymore but they're keeping him safe until "this" is over. We ask who we should check-in with, she says they'll be in touch. [[Jade]] asks if she's conncted with [[Niko]], she confirms she's seen him but he's been cleared. She says he was held in solitary and all of his stories check out. She thinks [[Ulia Glorsbade]] is to blame, since she never showed up - the [[Fire Raisers]] have had money issues so she and the illusionsists they hired might've been stiffed. When [[Winifey]] thinks about [[Niko]] being cleared, she remembers the [[Bellisme Show]] attack. She says [[Willum]] might be ready to update us, they've gotten rid of about 20% of their forces. [[Jade]] asks if they're dead, and she says only some are. They're holding some of the others. She says we should be busy the night before [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]] too. [[Jade]] asks about [[Relakas]] and [[Winifey|Winnie]] agrees he's also a bad guy. [[Costi]] asked about [[Victor]], and she just says that he makes a good higher up. 

[[Jade]] brings up the people meeting with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]:  [[Del Scrucks]], [[Tevkosh Adelka]], and [[Gheston Oppe]]. She says that's very helpful to know who they shouldn't trust. She trades us info that [[Niko]] was crying in his sleep, she thinks he misses someone. She says he brings up [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] often. She also tells us that [[Cut]] likes [[Jade]]'s glasses. As we're talking, a waiter comes up and says they're going to lock the doors from some criminal activity, it seems like there's a protest against the guards out front. It seems like this happens almost every night in the area. Dinner ends, [[Rez]] has drinks with her, and then goes home.

We go back to the [[Chapel of the Lost]]. [[Jade]] stays up and does cocaine to keep reading [[The Unnatural Naturality]]. She learns that [[Bane]] made the 9 [[Hell]] and [[Bashaba]] made the [[The Abyss]], with devils and demons. [[Tyr]] and [[Torm]] made [[Celestia]] and [[Ellysium]] with Celestials and Angels. A lot of war happened in between, estimated 32,000 years. Eventually [[Bane]] got bored and kept expanding. She's a little grumpy the next morning.

[[Hugh]] goes to the flames, and divines to  asking "What is the most important thing I can prepare to protect my friends in the [[Halls of the Dead]]?" there's a surge of flame, an extra bright yellow flame tendril mix with some black bits of coal begin to form a circle around the lighter white bits, which then burst as white flame and clears away everything. 

[[Hugh]] reads the [[Book on Preparing Dead Bodies]], [[The Raven Queen]] focuses on burial, and believe that the dead body is a vessel to be protected. There's mostly crypts, some mausoleums too. They don't normally bury people with things, it's unnecessary. They treat bodies with respect, guarding them between one day and a week. Bodies are cleaned, gentle reposed, and dressed in black with a ravens feather somewhere, so they can be watched as part of the flock. Death workers usually start by joining the [[Death Watchers]] and taking posts, proving their committment by staying awake. After a year or two they take a pilgrimage to move up. [[Hugh]] heard them discussing "under her wing" as common language. "The moment of passage" is another key phrase as a central tenant to the religion. The pilgrimage is called -----

[[Costi]] reads more of [[The Ascended]] and learns that the Eastern Tinkante Raven was the breed that [[The Raven Queen]] had as a familiar, but he learns that the now-extinct Western Tinkante Raven (like [[Samuel]]) which has distinct head tufting and the beak shape was an almond instead of circle. He knows she's the last of the Ascended gods, she traveled into [[The Abyss]] where she battled with [[Orcus]] for about 1,000 years to earn her immortality. She's now mortal enemies with [[Vecna]] and [[Orcus]]. 

[[Rez]] and [[Freya]] go to sell things, and talk up the price - we double our party income. 

We head to [[Fug Luggers]] to fight in the [[Bloody Waters]]. We find a brawl-filled dive, we order the pass phrase of "10 shots of whiskey" and are escorted past the bar. He asks each of in turn if we're a cop. We all say no, he asks who [[Hugh]]'s holy symbol is, and confirms [[Moradin]] is not a cop. Then lets us into the fighting pits. It's brutal and loud - we're led to the back and are welcomed by [[Giary]]. He takes us to meet [[Rhys]], the handler who's been coordinating his fights. [[Rhys]] is a well-dressed human man in his late thirties with a goatee, short ponytail, and glasses. He walks us through the process: we give our names, pay the 10 gp deposit (which you get back + winnings), indicate battle type (death or wound), and how tough a challenge we want. Fighting people pays more, and fighting to the death pays more. Odds are worse fighting a monster, so you can earn a bit more money fighting the monster. We can expect between 100gp, per person per fight. He says it's entertainment and the audience likes a show and a story. 

We make our fighting names: [[Hugh]] - [[The Colonel]], [[Jade]] - [[Venom]], [[Hugh]] - [[Slayer]], [[Costi]] - [[The Beast]], [[Rez]] - [[Trouble]]. And our group name [[Giary]] and the Circus. 

We all disguise ourselves some, [[Hugh]] covers his insignia and adds blood splatters, [[Rez]] gets herself painted to look like a dragon, [[Freya]] alters self, and [[Jade]] looks more monstorous.
