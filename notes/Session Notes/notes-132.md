# Session 132

We decide to head to [[AVAD]] for the day: to meet with [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]], and catch up with [[Sylvia]]. We call a carriage - on the way we talk about the storms that come out of [[Breakers Bay]], and remember they started about the same time as the [[Turian Waste]] appeared.

[[AVAD]] is notable for it's three spires, the [[Frozen Face Spire]] topped by a huge clock that is about 7:40 ahead, with hundreds of frozen clock faces along the sides, with two frozen large clocks on each side of the center running face (they randomly change times, which conjecture theorizes that they predict events, but none have been conclusively proven), the [[Crystal Spire]] the glass that makes up a crystal but opaque, and the [[Ten Deck Spire]] appears to be a massive house of cards but some of the faces are non-sensical.

We arrive, are momentarily distracted by how interesting [[Rez]] is (otherwise known as trying to learn more about [[Rez's Family]]) then decide to go find [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] notices that [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is getting quite the number of eyes, [[Costi]] has some admirers it seems - but no one approaches.

[[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] teaches in the [[Frozen Face Spire]], a class on using the natural world to divine. [[Costi]] caused a gasp upon his entrance, but is able to be guided in by [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. After a lovely little bout of public humiliation by his mother, the lecture continues to a very rapt [[Freya]] and [[Hugh|Finn]], while [[Rez]] causes minor distractions in the back row. 

A child named [[Tan]] builds up the courage to come talk to [[Costi]], trying SO hard to be cool, pretending to be older, and inviting [[Costi]] for a underground game of mage pong with a stolen bottle of wine. [[Freya]] thinks she'll blow his mind by giving him something even better, which causes most the rest of our party to panic, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] warning her we'll be removed from [[AVAD]] to which she responds "I don't even go here!". Room 617 in dorm 4, in case we're interested later.

[[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] tells us she'll be free in two hours. The study for visiting professors is in the [[Ten Deck Spire]]. We also ask about the office hours of a few professors [[Costi]] has sending to in our travels, [[Professor Rohed]] on sabbatical, [[Professor Vetsk]] however could join for tea. She has a favorite spot, a balcony on the [[Crystal Spire]], she'd like to show us. 

Working the front desk at one of the libraries is [[Everlynd]], a half-elf with short brown hair, in the more athletic clubs, a year above [[Costi]], and friends with [[Marina Alduchev]]. She's a bit icy to him, which makes sense when we remember his boss [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], killed her friend. When [[Costi]] asks for some help, she asks for a warrant. She does not bite on any attempts at friendliness, and even [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s charm bounces right off. However, her active [[Redscale]] student ID gets her into the library to go find [[Sylvia]].

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] does find her, and plays friendly, which she REALLY bites on. She shows her the job board, and there's nothing else in this room that she says relates. She escorts us back to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. As we leave, [[Everlynd]] asks if [[Costi]]'s gone to see [[Mara]] yet ([[Marina Alduchev]]'s younger sister) - she's been having a hard semester, hasn't left her room in weeks. 

[[Sylvia]] says the woman who gave her the sending stone to [[Rughork]] wasn't working at the desk right now, but she said next time she sees her she'll ask her name and then right it down for us. We tell her to let us know when she next hears from [[Rughork]] or if she thinks she's being followed. We'll sending to her, but when she says she's lonely, [[Costi]] thinks of [[Professor Pofan Gapenote]] could be a good match. He's a gnome who makes crystal balls, teaches intro classes, patient with a deep voice and rugged hands. We help her gussy up a little bit, then send her off to meet him. 

We go to the [[Crystal Spire]] to meet up with [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]]. However, we do notice a notable increase of some [[Eberronian Military]] guards, specifically from the [[Eberronian First Division]] - there's many many more today than [[Costi]] has seen in his whole life. One of them is [[Marius A]], [[Marina Alduchev]]'s ex, he's a corporal, and part of the [[Jezeten]] city guard. He spent six months traveling in [[Devios]] in [[Haag Kitot]] under a general his family was connecting with. [[Freya]] offers to spar him, and he invites us back to the barracks. He has been stationed here for a number of years. He offers a date to all of the women in [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] simultaneously. He asks [[Costi]] if he's seen [[Elena]] yet, who he mentioned as his younger sister, who is finishing her thesis. He invites us to drinks, and we tell him we're staying at [[The Compass Point]]. We decide to meet at the [[Seven Shields]] two evenings from now - [[Marius A]] asks for us to bring up his name, he's been trying to get an audience himself.

[[Costi]] says [[Elena]] is a friend, and he miiiiight have had some unresolved feelings for a little while, or a few years. [[Hugh|Finn]] checks in with [[Costi]], but he's okay. We arrive at the designated balcony to meet [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] and [[Professor Vetsk]]. She hits a hidden button and gives us 15 minutes to discuss safely. She starts with being so mad, and so proud, of [[Costi]]. She and [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] spent their whole lives trying to keep them out of things, but perhaps it was his birthright. 

[[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] says [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] was right - he said if he went missing not to worry, that he'd be back soon, and that he thought that [[Costi]] had a role to play. She assumes he's at a slave camp again. We ask if it could be at [[Orzudan]], and she says she doesn't believe it exists, we break the news. She confirms that there's still an [[ELA]] after [[Devkorus Kaa]]'s death - but the beating heart is still [[Deal 'Ras]]. [[Costi]] asks where all the magic is coming from, she says they have friends. The undead are liberated assets, giving them vengeance against their creators and also getting killed, ending their torment. Any that have discussed creating undead has been excommunicated. 

She invites us to a daily tea here, so we can have more conversations. They're getting ready for their own strike, they want to hit them before they get hit themselves. Buying them time let's them get stronger. The focus will likely be the [[Eberronian First Division]]. We ask if we gave them a target date, if that would be possible to coordinate, and she says she trusts [[Costi]]. 

[[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] gives us incredible ammunition, the nickname [[Sti Sti]], and says [[Elena]] asked after him. She says the [[Aldea]]'s are family friends, they're elites in [[Jezeten]]. We pivot to her being stressed about [[Costi]]'s misbehavior: gambling rings, drugs, etc. [[Freya]] gets going and starts with a Princess, then moves to knives, and sex worker he NEVER paid.  

She leaves, humored and a little distraught, but mostly happy to see her son. 

And just so we all know: (fuck [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]], marry [[Elena]], kill [[Qik]])
