# Detailed Notes: Session 61

We get back to the hotel and recap our conversation with [[Ellinev Del]]. 

[[Freya]] sendings to [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]: "Hi, book is hard but helpful. Found out who and where it came from. Do you know [[Caleb Schleuse]]? Anything to knowfor meeting him?" "[[Caleb Schleuse]] yes, talented academic. Good writer. Smart man. Don't know him personally. Say nice things, ego"

[[Hugh]] sendings to [[Giary]]: "Use less words. Staying at [[Chapel of the Lost]], update - party is explosion, don't go. Come see us tonight or tomorrow?" "Oh, so you didn't get the rest of my message? Shit, sorry okay. Yes. Tomorrow good. Job [[Fishermen]] now friends, money [[Oceantouched]]. Party bad"

We all work on some individual tasks, [[Costi]] copies the alter self spell scroll into his recipe book. [[Hugh]] reads some of his new books. When we wake up [[Hugh]] and [[Jade]] get talking about his expirimenting with taste, and [[Jade]] decides to order many condiments for a "thrilling breakfast", which ends up being a sex worker covered in inanimate objects, choosing to be our plate. We all try some various sauces and discuss how common this behavior is.

We briefly visit about the [[Halls of the Dead]], entrance is free, many embark on pilgrimage here as it's one of the only places dedicated to the gods of death: [[Kelemvor]] (peacefulness, nothingness, and rest), [[Loviatar]] (god of tormernt and pain), and one to [[The Raven Queen]] (the moment of death, and the last mortal to achieve ascension in the age of gods. Hates anything that messes with the sanctity of life). There's a chapel to each in the top level. Pilgrims can stay there for free. This area makes up an extremely small portion of the area. 

If you have an ancestral connection to a tomb, you can make a yearly payment you can visit them, or through a genreous donation you can visit whoever you want. You're paid to be taken to a specific place. It's very guarded and solem.

On the way to dinner to meet the [[Fire Raisers]], we discuss securing our own mount on [[Ellinev Del]]'s advice so we can travel without being officially logged. We make our way to the [[Quay Elliptical]]. We ask for directions to [[Flounder's]], and on the way [[Hugh]] takes a vial of ocean water. Its a childrens restuarants. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] asks for one of the boat tables, [[Costi]] goes to the bathroom and alters himself to look like a child. To "blend in". We tell the hostess it's [[Costi]]'s 10th birthday party, they escort us to the crow's nest. 

In the room we see 7 people, 2 of them we all recognize: [[Cinder]] and [[Winifey]], there's also [[Willum]], [[Cut]], and 3 new figures: a burly graying dwarf with a thick beard with a bit of clay in his beard named [[Knawfur]], an aarakocra with singed feathers looking very sullen named [[Zhivaa]], and [[Rhene Blackstone]] a mostly red dragonborn with sworls of blue scales, a charming boyish look, tall and atheletically built but not builky, and dressed fancy but a defeated expression.

[[Jade]] uses her glasses to scan, they gray when she looks at [[Winifey]]. [[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]? Who knows. The energy in the room is bad, [[Willum]], [[Cinder]], and [[Winifey]] all seem smiley, but there's a tension behind their faces. 

We introduce them to [[Jade]], and we quickly ask them if they have someone following us. They introduce us to the new people, three associates of the [[Fire Raisers]] in [[Arkhosia (City)]]. He says [[Knawfur]] handles a lot of the import/export business, [[Zhivaa]] is one of their 'rising stars', and a good friend of the [[Fire Raisers]] [[Rhene Blackstone]] of the [[Blackstone Family]]. 

We start to give them our report, and share that we gave the [[Fire Raiser Mystery Cylinder]] and other fake information to [[Ellinev Del]] back in [[Jalantar]]. When we mention [[Threthdia Scrivit]], [[Cinder]] says it was on their list of things to take care of, that she was a bad person. We share that we found [[Ulia Glorsbade]], and mention that we tried to take care of things but it was kind of faking for us. They say when [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] showed up it was clear that [[Ulia Glorsbade]] was no longer working with them, which has required them to reasses and think creatively now. We say if we need to plant more infomation with [[Ellinev Del]] we can do that, since we checked in. We don't bring up [[Niko]], our work for [[Ellinev Del]], or our conversation with [[Srictha]]. 

[[Cinder]] says that things are "accelerating", and [[Winifey]] shares that they have some work for us. They want us to keep our work with [[Ellinev Del]] so we can feed her fake information, she gives us some letters for us to pretend we found. She says we should say we found them at a dead drop in [[Sciorca's Clutch]] tailing a red and orange aarakocra we think is involved in the [[Fire Raisers]]. [[Willum]] says they're getting to the stages of preparing for their "final act", around the election to stage a "real demonstration", and their previous work has not been enough to make real impact. They just need to get a few more things in place to get a "demonstration of the will of the people to effectively get [[The Circle]] to consider our demands", and that once they finish a bit more work they can make their big plans casualty-free. To make sure they can keep it safe, they need our help. 

During that speech, [[Rez]] tracks that [[Winifey]] seems almost disinterested in the conversation, she's got a glazed over look and focusing entirely on her book. What does that mean? [[Jade]] sees that [[Rhene Blackstone]] seems excited but also tense by the conversation. 

[[Cinder]] asks [[Rhene Blackstone]] to explain what happened and he fakes it to try and diminsh the risk but can't hide his fear. He turns over the conversation to [[Zhivaa]] and she tells us they went into the [[Copper Mines]] to get a package, but encountered a bunch duergar and some strange monster with eyestalks that killed three of their operatives. They broke the elevator they used. 

[[Willum]] says there's a package they need to recieve, but their agents have been defeated. Beings from the [[underdark]] have moved into the [[Copper Mines]], included one that is quite dangerous. A beholder. Currently, this creature has the parcel. They can't tell us what's in it, but it being in the beholder's control puts the entire [[Driftrock]] into risk. They've found a new route to that area, with the help of [[Rhene Blackstone]], who's family owns the [[Copper Mines]]. It's a complicated and more risky route, going through the [[Copper Mine Union Hall]]. The [[Copper Mines Workers Union]] is not working with the [[Fire Raisers]], but they believe there is an entrance their records room, used by them. The president of the [[Copper Mines Workers Union]] is a puppet of [[The Providers]], named [[Gilderoy Vaneshi]]. 

They say the package is well insulated, and should not break. It's heavy, encased in a large stone and copper ore. [[Jade]] asks if there are still uncontrolled fire monsters, and [[Zhivaa]] says no. [[Rez]] says that we want somethings from our friend [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and asked if she wanted anything - she asks for her friends bodies. We say we'll try to bring them if we can. 

[[Cinder]] says that every day it's down there is added risk to the people of [[Arkhosia (City)]]. He says just outside the elevator by the rendezvous point, there's a mining cart. If it's survived, we can put the parcel there and it will go straight to the [[Copper Foundry]], but either way we must get it there. [[Freya]] asks if they're heard of a [[portable hole]] and they give us one of their's, and we can return it. [[Hugh]] asks if we use it for one more job, and [[Rez]] says we need to do some graverobbing for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. They say sure, they want us to end or work for him as soon as possible. [[Costi]] asks if they know about magic mirrors, and they say there's lots of powerful weapons it could be. 

We ask if they know ways into the [[Halls of the Dead]], and they say our friend [[Giary]] has been working for [[Fishermen]] and might know. Interesting they've been tracking that. 

On the [[Copper Mines]] job, they say they know it's dangerous, and give us twelve vials: 6 potions of greater healing, and 6 regular healing potions. There's also an empty vial with slight sparkles inside, which is an invisibility potion, and a vial with a blue feather in it, which can make you fly. 

As we're leaving, [[Rez]] makes a pass at [[Winifey]] and asks her to get drinks. She seems intrigued. The rest of the table is mildly traumatized. [[Hugh]] has a quick conversation with [[Knawfur]], who says he was in the infantry in the military, then owned a forge in [[Zilvengrod]], and was brought into the [[Fire Raisers]] to help. [[Cinder]] takes a moment to thank [[Rhene Blackstone]] for going back into the [[Copper Mines]], and gives him a pair of super fancy boots inlaid with gold to help him. He says they'll help him move quickly, but if it's starts to go bad [[Fire Raisers]] need him to get it out. 

[[Rez]] asks if we should still stop by the [[Starving Stars]] or deliver the barrels of 3434, and [[Willum]] says he was fucking with us. [[Cinder]] then takes a moment to say he's sorry for our loss of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. [[Rez]] says diamonds always make her think of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] since she was so fancy, and asks where we can buy some? He says [[Quaath]] is the best place for that and that [[Arkhosia (City)]] is mostly metals. 

We finally leave, and head back to the [[Chapel of the Lost]] to plan. [[Hugh]] sendings to [[Magister]] "Hello, hope you are safe. Fighting beholder, any tips? Can send additional sending if there is need" "Oh, goodness. 50 words doesn't quite seem adequate to convey advice. I'll get you something more complete." [[Jade]] tries to talk to [[The Curator]] to ask for help. 

We start to talk to [[Rhene Blackstone]] to ask him for help, and getting into the [[Copper Mine Union Hall]], and he begrudgingly tells us about who he lost. We mostly scheme about our plans.

We break off to do our various tasks. [[Hugh]] reads, [[Freya]] also tries to reach out to [[The Curator]]. [[Rez]] casts sending to [[Ghez Yhutl]]

[[Jade]] goes to knock on [[Rhene Blackstone]]'s door, citing how much energy he has. She has scales in many places too, you see. He invites her inside.

[[Costi]] dreams and is greeted by [[Magister]], who says he's speaking to him by dreaming - and sadly is the only warforged he knows capable of dreaming. He says he has more information on beholder's, he says they are not from this realm, but are given to experience by dreams of a powerful creature, who can then create others through their own dreaming. They have a large central eye, with 10 stalks: each can shoot a beam with different effects that are unique to each beholder. They might hamr, incapaicate, or outright kill you. He recommends avoiding the beams if possible. [[Costi]] asks about blinding it, and [[Magister]] thinks you can mainly blind the central eye but is uncertain if that would stop the anti-magic effect, and the stalks are impervious, they see of their own accord. [[Magister]] says they dominate creatures so maybe that's the role of Deugar. He also says that no magic at all can work in the eye, but will return when the gaze shifts. 

He also tells him about our double-spy role for the [[Arkhosia]] government and also the [[Fire Raisers]]. [[Magister]] tells him to be careful.

[[The Curator]] comes to visit [[Rez]]. They talk about their relationship, and [[Rez]] asks a lot about who they are to know how much she can be helpful. She asks if [[The Curator]] is from negative plane? They say they're from all over. They ask want [[Rez]] truly wants, and she says she wants to be forever, and [[The Curator]] says okay. They also offer a favor in exchange for a favor from [[Rez]], and asks for one of [[Rez]]'s scales, reluctantly aggres. [[The Curator]] takes one and it's replace by a gray scale, and if [[Rez]] needs help to pull it out.

In the morning, [[Jade]] looks at the new scale and it flashes gray, just like the spot on [[Freya]]'s back. More info on [[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]], it seems. [[Costi]] and [[Rhene Blackstone]] go to get the earthbind scroll, and we chat briefly about [[Vask]] seeing if [[Victoria Several]] can help us get into the [[Halls of the Dead]]. 

As the sunsets, we travel to the [[Copper Mine Union Hall]] to begin our quest. It's near the [[Kindness Kiln]] and roughly 130ft away from the enntrace to the [[Copper Mines]].  As we get off the flyteway [[Hugh]] once again sees the strange emptiness that means we have our invisible tail, but they apparently notice they're made and don't seem to follow us off the cart. [[Our invisible friend]]

We make it to the [[Copper Mine Union Hall]], and [[Costi]] does some boons including borrowed knowledge, which has someone appear in his head, asking what he needs and helping him be stealthy. [[Costi]] picks the lock and he and [[Rez]] go to check out the inside for any stragglers. The rest of our party makes there way in, but poorly. [[Jade]] trips over the entrance (nat 1) and [[Freya]] perfectly catches her (Nat 20), but misses that [[Hugh]] does the same thing who crashes loudly to the floor (nat 1). [[Rhene Blackstone]] does well enough. We all run down the hallway and [[Costi]] stays to cover for us. He silent images a drunk person stumbling their way back out, and uses mage hand to close the door behind them. Two union workers come to investigate, and they're definitely some muscle. Using their distraction, he runs after us to meet up. 

We explore through the hallways, and passing by some bathrooms and sleeping barracks, we find the records room. Exploring [[Jade]] sees a glimpse of a door behind a bookcase. [[Rhene Blackstone]] tries and fails to move it, so [[Freya]] simply picks it up. [[Costi]] investigates and senses 5 copper wires behind the door. We try to figure out how to break the trap, and [[Costi]] cast borrowed knowledge again to learn how to use his thieves tools. He manages to disarm part of it, but slips and trigger 3/5ths of the trap - as 3 of the suits of armor animate and attack.

We make realtively quick work of them, and [[Hugh]] magically opens the door. [[Hugh]] magically cloaks [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] to help us be sneaky. We make our way down, and eventually it opens into a small room. There are scones with unlit torches, and directly across from the entrance there is a smiling draconinc mouth with red scales. [[Rhene Blackstone]] immediately recognizes a character of his father. We talk him through his confusion at why the workers maaaaay not be the biggest fan of him, and feeling frustrated, he lashes out and tries to cut down the stone bust. Above "I eat and drink the fruit of your labor, I call myself boss, you call me your slaver, my gluttonous gullet can never be full, but throw in your effort and give me a pull" - we place some copper pieces into [[Rez]] overeagerly pulls, it reaches out and bites here. [[Rez]] relents and gives up a piece of her copper ore, and [[Freya]] pulls and it releases, leaving a opening for us to go through. 

In the next hallway, we see a mine cart that [[Costi]] can tell is magically enchanted, but [[Rhene Blackstone]] tells us the drop point would be much deeper - and many of them are used for transportation. His blood unlocks it and we start to travel through the tunnels, through veins of copper ore throughout the walls, floor, and ceiling of our journey.

Ahead of us we see the tracks fall away, and [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] jumps into action. [[Freya]] tries to grow a fine layer of plants to create a baseline patch over the gap, [[Rez]] (with her extensive knowledge of metal working thanks to [[Divitston Goldstone]]) conjures a perfect, in fact improved replica of the track over the back 2/3rds of the gap. [[Jade]] grabs the [[Blow Em]] and sticks it into [[Rhene Blackstone]]'s mouth, lifting his weight and he grabs the nose of the cart perfectly angling it onto the new tracks, [[Costi]] casts a spell to create ice and we easily clear the hurdle! Keeping the cart and continuing our journey.

At the end of the track, we enter into a new chamber with rough hewn walls and a door off to our right side. Directly in front of us is a large stone statue of a dwarven worker with a pickaxe over one shoulder and a bag of copper. It has a plaque that says, "the workers champion", and [[Rez]] just says the first name that pops into her mind [[Gilderoy Vaneshi]], and instead of working it triggers the statue to attack. 

[[Hugh]] starts to cut up the monsters for supplies, [[Freya]] gives [[Rez]] the copper pouch the golem had. We notice a similar space on it's former pedastal that we think would probably align. [[Jade]], [[Costi]], [[Rhene Blackstone]] go into the room offf-side from where we were attacked, and find a javelin with what seems to be magical lightning embellishment. We bring the golem in to barricade the door, and everyone enters into a tiny hut from [[Hugh]] to rest.
