# Detailed Notes: Session 121

[[Hugh|Finn]] spends time communicating with people on our march. 
- To [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]], "[[Eva Sidorev|Eva]] knows to look for you in [[Thelran Asari]]. tinkerer. Small human with heavily scarred face. Beautiful. 75 years. I’ll send again soon with location", he responds, "Thank you, [[Hugh|Finn]]. No one’s found me yet. Sorry for anything I said that was too tough, you’re a good man."
- To [[Marigold]], "we’re on our way back. Wanna do dinner? A lot has happened. I’m sure you’ve heard." She responds, "If you try to NOT do dinner we’re in a fight. As soon as you’re not busy, we’ll make it happen."
- To [[Tyros]] "how bad were losses? Any updates we need? Heading back to [[Burbank Compound]] now", he responds, "Quite bad. I think five of us made it out. I’m on my way to [[Jezeten]]. Did you get it out?" Then "Yes. Losses were heavy for [[Eberron]]. Wounded [[Teld]] seen by very few. Dogs are dead. Doubtful they will return in any form. Relief is unreal", he responds, "You did incredible work. Hopefully I see you again soon."

[[Freya]] attunes to [[Sinkerk]]'s [[Shadowform Shield]]. It has a dark energy that feels different from the desecrated spot on her back. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] discovers that the [[ELA Ebony Stake]] is consecrated. She makes a note to look into it once we're away from the camp. 

On the way, we talk with [[Fingers]], who is quite pleased with her own actions during the conflict, saving [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]. She enjoys taunting us, but plays it characteristically cool. She says she hooked up with [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] previously. 

As we arrive back, it's clear that [[Sienna Burbank]] is waiting for us to arrive, a smile on her face. [[Colvia Ghul]] reports in and says [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] is not able to. The energy is stilted, and the exchange is intense. There's a strange technical politeness, but it's unclear who is actually holding power.

Strangely, we're strongly encouraged by [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] to go straight to our rooms in a sealed carriage with bars on the windows and a lock on the door. [[Costi]] is able to discern that it's seemingly for our protection rather than our containment. [[Hugh|Finn]] reads that the energy around the campaign are tense and dour. Notably though, we did enter the [[Burbank Compound]] ahead of the rest of the what's left of the [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]]. 

[[Dania]] opens the door and lets us out. When we try to ask her what's going on, she brushes it off and doesn't give us anything more. We ask if there's any other guests in the [[Burbank Compound]] to be aware of, there's not. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] will call upon us shortly, for a discussion. 

Once we're in our rooms, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] finds time to sneak away and identify the [[ELA Ebony Stake]] - she finds a very intense aura, with a confusing multiple layers of enchantment. One, at the root, is deep twisted evil, with a hallowed energy around it. Something has fundamentally changed this items nature. 

[[Costi]] sticks his head outside the room and asks a porter for books on religions of the continent, specifically looking for symbols. He comes back and they're mostly children's books, but a few real ones at the end. He spends time looking for the symbol on [[Freya]]'s [[Shadowform Shield]]. 

We end up discussing [[The Rippers]] and if [[Freya]] should take them. It quickly turns into an argument, [[Hugh|Finn]] tries to explain they are traumatizing to him, but [[Freya]] takes it poorly when [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] also brings up her inability to control her anger. [[Rez]] makes it worse for everyone but has a great time. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] disengages to play the harp. 

[[Dania]] eventually comes to get us, and leads us to the audience chamber - inside are [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], and [[Colvia Ghul]]. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] pretends we were fetched too early, and has us listen in the corner while he debriefs with [[Teld]]. It's a technical victory, so he won't be disciplined, but blames him for [[Treddleston]], who he encouraged promotion for, and says the only reason there's any success was [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] - despite filing formal complaints about us and flogging us for infiltrating the [[ELA]] as hired infiltration specialists. 

[[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] doesn't waiver and threatens his own recounting to [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] is unbothered and let's him know he'll be taking his own formal recounting. [[Colvia Ghul]] leans in and supports [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]. It's clear [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] is barely holding back his rage as he leaves.

He asks us if there's anything else we should report, we lean in on how bad [[Teld]] was. He says that our reports from [[Colvia Ghul]] should be sufficient. [[Hugh|Finn]] is given the bracers, both of them, as he requested. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] is formally requesting his demotion for a second time. The first was was ignored, but this is one of the worst military losses in recent memory. He's been in service for enough years, and is quite popular - but so are many of the fallen soldiers. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says he'll have some more questions in a few hours, we can meet in his chambers with the rest of the [[Groups and Organizations/Burbanks|Burbanks]]. He encourages us to leave soon, but not tomorrow, and let things settle. His letters should reach the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] by then. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] asks if [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] would like to hang, it will need to be a couple of days. He'll also ask him to help deal with the warforged bracers. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] talks about what he might be able to use from the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]].

As we head down to met them all again, we have tense moment with [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] where he seems angry, leaving the area we head into. We're greeted by [[Trisha]], [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]. He starts with a toast to those fallen, stressing their sacrifice. 

They share what they've learned about [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]; after tracking us closely in [[Jalantar]], talking with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], and getting a sense of our trustworthiness. Now, they want to be more honest with us ([[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] too, he's had a tough day but a [[Groups and Organizations/Burbanks|Burbanks]] first). He hints at [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]'s "plans", and proposes one more adventure - killing a Duchess. The damn breaks, and we all agree it's terrible here and vampires shouldn't rule a country. Call it [[The Family Project]]. 

He asks if we got "it" out of [[Golstrava]], as they were working on a weapon, and he knew they would get in touch with [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. When [[Costi]], [[Freya]], and [[Hugh|Finn]] are confused - we ask [[Hugh|Finn]] to greater restoration himself and [[Freya]], [[Trisha]] helps [[Costi]].

They remember everything, and when [[Costi]] calls out [[Rez]] for doctoring their memories, she whips out a double back flip no big deal. 

Then we show him the [[ELA Ebony Stake]], which he says looks like what he expected. He tells us more about vampires, that the higher up they are, the harder they are to kill. If you stick one with an inverted piece of their own coffin, you can prevent them from doing some of their most significant magic. Ours is a vestige of the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] coffin. 

[[Costi]] asks about their ties to the [[ELA]], they like their intentions, assist them, but maintain their role, with some worry about how extreme their actions might become - citing the [[Fire Raisers]]. The [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] want to kill the [[Three Dukes]], and institute a fairer government. We agree to help with [[A Murder of Dukes]]. They expect the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] will want a meeting with [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], and a group trip to [[Jezeten]] might be in order. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] also tells [[Costi]] that he might warn [[Costi's mom]] that a 'sterner hand' might come down in [[AVAD]] after the [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]]'s loses. Some folks, she'll know who they are, might want to "make a trip to the mountain". 

They have an initial plan, but don't want to give us more information than we need right now. We all kick back and have our first night without pretense with them.
