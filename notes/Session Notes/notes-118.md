# Detailed Notes: Session 118

Costi receives sending from [[Tyros]]: "2/3rds of a mile from ruins, off deer path you are following, find elevated campsite. Under 3 layers of stone, in the fire, find textured obsidian."

along the path, we find chunks of deers strewn around ripped by humanoid sized bites - ask jamzik, calling card for lukan of telds dogs. hes on a private mission from teld, and seems to be nearby. 

we keep traveling, [[Costi]] gets [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to tell her about [[Tyros]]' sending, trying to dog [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]]'s eye. 

We try and distract her further, Samuel attacking Costi doesn’t hold much weight but Rez asks Jazmin to rank order who she’s sleep with in our party - Finn, Adrienne, Costi, Rez, freya

Another hour or so in, Finn finds some broken branches and torn leaves, with more spattered blood. We try to ask Samuel to check it out again. A more grizzly sight awaits, over a dozen humanoid figures - though it’s somewhat hard to tell due to how decimated they are. 

We split up slightly for Freya Costi Adrienne and Jamzik go to investigate, Rez and Finn stat behind. Upon searching they seem very meticulously picked over, specific pieces of paper and only high value items are the only things missing. The bodies seem to be dumped over an 18 hour span. Most killed elsewhere, some here but many are manufactured into this scene. One has an ela tattoo, of a closed raised fist with a yellow outline. Tracks leading away seem less than 6 hours old and end notably suddenly. 

Jazmin confirms lukan can fly, transforming into a wolf bat. 

Finn and Rez have a chat, he warns her about how brutal the dogs are. Then he apologizes for calling her unserious, she says it’s only fair and maybe it’s for the best people don’t think she’s serious. He respects her, and wants to be friends for a long time. 

We reunite, and once again talk about fucking, each other and others. Then try to learn more about jamzik. She doesn’t particularly like killing, but stays loyal to teld out of 1) fear 2) he rewards success, despite us not seeing it yet 3) people trust his decision making. 

She also confirms our treatment is because of who WE are. We’re tied to Burbank, have Finn, don’t treat teld with enough respect, and many in the battalion think we’re plants to discredit him. Finn asks why she thinks teld doesn’t like her, and she confirms he views it’s his fault he was passed up for promotion and ruins his career. 

Finn expresses his frustration that he was told to leave and did, but Jazmik enforces that is not how teld sees the situation.

Adrienne mentions a healthy respect far colvia, and jamzik says she brought up that Adrienne did not agree to give her info. We lean in that it’s annoying she has her god secrets. Jamzik pulls out the materials for the spell, and they negotiate on terms - primarily that she wants the knowledge. When Adrienne won’t budge about what she’ll learn from corellan, she offers to learn about the book. Freya agrees. If it’s not enough to warrant the ivory, we ask for equivalent info about the second division. Finn cracks a joke about taking down teld, unsure on how it landed. 

Freya shares answers to three questions: 

how did you get the book, and how are connected to them - I got in from a friend in the wayfinders, I’m in the wayfinders. She clarifies her mentor rawley. 

How did she meet rawley - he came to her village

Is the book related to the symbol you drew on the ground for the bear? - I’m not entirely sure, Adrienne chimes in that yes. 

Jamzik says she’s never seen the symbol before. 

In exchange for the most interesting secret she knows, two of us have to tell her our most interesting secrets. Freya shares about frogs economic trade disputes, and shows where in the liveth forest. Finn offers to tell how warforged have sex, they have a conversation.

She says there’s a place rivecs bastion, a teleporting library that moves from plane to plane, it’s on Elysium currently. To get there, you must have a specific tuning fork. She’s heard, there’s one in Eberron. We say if we find the tuning fork we’ll take her with us, and jamzik says let’s get through this first.

In exchange for the most interesting secret about her, it would be pricier - that information could harm her. 

About an hour outside of golstrava finn notices a hint of smoke 50 feet up the cliffside. this seems like where costi was told to branch off. the same groups split. We see the fire was put out only an hour or two ago, with a trail and zipline away. In the fire, Costi finds the mentioned piece of obsidian under the coals, and sneaks it into a wrist pocket. Adrienne tries to distract jamzik. But freya ends up doing a better job by misunderstanding ziplines and jumping off a full cliff. 

Meanwhile, Rez and Finn try to understand how Lorkan does what he does - they remember that vampires can turn into bats, historically, but this also maybe seems like a were-bat situation. It's not normal either way, and most likely not druidic. 

Costi uses the excuse that he needs to change to look at the obsidian stone, and notices that the ridges are definitely intentionally placed but detects no magic and doesn't unriddle the use. 

We ask a bit more about [[Lukan]], and learn he can be invisible or otherwise unseen in some way whenever he wises - and often sits in on conversations with [[Fingers]] or [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] - and has been in several of our conversations. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] proposes a further circuit to search for other outward camps before closely searching [[Golstrava]]. We do a typically us job trying to sneak around, but do a good job both being "thorough" and sloooow. 

Moving in for a closer perimeter, we recognize a couple of gravestones, marking the [[Death House]], the non-religious funeral home typical to [[Eberron]]. 300ft south of that there's a notably charred black wooden stake, around 15 feet tall, with a less singed section in the middle. 500 ft south of that, there's a large portion of the ruins that have sunk into the ground a little bit - this is much more reclaimed by the habitat, turning into marshlands, extending to the whole Southern and Eastern ends of [[Golstrava]]. There's another post in the middle of a notably non-ruined segment of land. 

there's another grouping of these stakes, still smoking, in the center of town. Near it is another notably large building. Several areas show movement to [[Samuel]]'s eye. 

[[Rez]] turns herself and [[Costi]] invisible to go and check out one of the stakes, as they approach, they can see it is riddled and worn down by time. Each face is two feet wide, slimming down to only one foot at the top. It radiates abjuration magic, augmented by necromancy, and dark energy. The bottom third and top third are singed, the middle a lighter color. There are symbols and sigils carved into it. The marsh won't approach, for seemingly 500 feet area. [[Rez]] notes that it feels similar to [[The Shadowfell]] energy. Not directly tied, but similarly desecrated. [[Samuel]] looks at it, but avoided touching it. 

We decide to kill a few hours before doing another scouting round. [[Costi]] takes the time to go "read" and look at the obsidian stone. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] distracts [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] again by telling her that [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] intentionally gave [[Hugh|Finn]] his memories back right before sending us on this mission - she hints that as maybe a loaded decision. An oversight, of course. She says she owes her a secret, and will pay her back before [[Golstrava]]. 

[[Rez]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] have a bit of heart to heart about his experience living through time, and how he's coping. Angrier than expected, and yet still thinks [[Eva Sidorev|Eva]] was the best experience of his life. The shorter life spans surrounding him are more special, because they have to fit things in.

[[Costi]] received a sending, "Message received?", he replies "Have stone. Unsure purpose? Nearby. I have a lot of questions, also don't know if I want answers right now" He looks at it again, spending more time than he should. Finally, he figures out there's a cipher on it, but a fairly complex one. They assume we can crack it. 

We take turns trying to crack this stone while keeping [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] occupied, [[Rez]] making lindith for everyone to drink. [[Hugh|Finn]] has a flashback while looking at it, remembering he was a cipher-breaker. He reads the message fluently "The time you bought us has proven critical in finalizing our work in [[Golstrava]]. Beware: There are horrors in [[Golstrava]] that have yet to be unearthed. That is part of why we chose this location. As you come to [[Golstrava]], tell us anything and everything you can about the [[Eberron]]ians traveling with you. In the center of town, at the intersection of old Korkav and Rachtsad streets, there is a burnt out shelter for the less fortunate. It’s a large building, and the bunked beds are visible from the street. Inside, below, there is a bunker we’ve hidden behind an illusory wall. This will not hold for long; after a short time we imagine it will be found, so it’s important that you move quickly. There are a series of traps set to eliminate anyone who tries to breach this wall, unless the correct word is said before you cross the threshold. Reach out to receive that word. Once inside, we’ll have an item that you must do everything within your power to conceal, keep safe, and get out of [[Golstrava]]. You are our best chance to save it, and with it our best chance to strike a blow against the bloodsuckers destroying our people.”

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Tyros]], "Message received, what's the password?", he responds, "First, "his sister" then "her brother", [[Hugh|Finn]] thinks this is a clue to tailored to us specifically, beyond [[Costi]], but that the [[ELA]] would know having looked into us. We think maybe "[[Nadia]], [[Vask]]"?

[[Costi]] sends to [[Tyros]], "Do we need to go tonight? Or is tomorrow acceptable? Also, [[Rez]]'s brother?? [[Vask]]??" he responds, "We assume this will happen during assault, hopefully you keep cover. Do your best to do so. Can't give name, keep eyes open"

[[Costi]] teases that we all have assassins chasing us and asks what she'll share - she doesn't seem to believe us. He tells her about the [[Gruung]], and they discuss for a while. [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] brings up a seriously interesting point that they would have to be helped to get in, they're working with someone. [[Rez]] asks if she knows any secrets about dragons, [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] says she thinks people were offered as sacrifices to try and get the chromatic dragons not to attack. Everyone is down for a beat, then takes a shot. 

[[Rez]] takes a watch and sends to [[Vask]], "​​Hey so - have you done anything with the [[ELA]]?? I mean, your reputation might proceed you. Somehow I'm sort of becoming a freedom fighter?", he replies, "You, fighting for the little folk? Unsurprised. There were some folks I helped in a fight in [[Jezeten]] a few months back, maybe were [[ELA]]?"

We wake the day of the attack. 

[[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] expects a plan, the full host will arrive in about 7 hours - [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] will a "point on the spear", and we should enter [[Golstrava]] from here, through the graveyard, and make our way into a city. Our goal is to try and get leadership, keeping the 1 in 10 rule alive. [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] thinks that the [[ELA]] is known for using undead, we're unsure how much we believe that. 

We spend some time getting to know [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] more. All of her family is dead, parents, sister, and uncle. Grew up hunting, but loved to spend her time reading, whenever she could find it. [[Hugh|Finn]] gives an olive branch of also loving plants and animals, and gives him "The Flora and Fauna of Eberron". She wants out when her tours are done, and due to her love of being outside the city we suggest maybe the [[Wayfinders]] but she says everyone in [[Eberron]] thinks they're spies - part of a powerful cabal that secretly runs things... *side eyes*

We ask more about her experience moving through the trials of [[Teld's Dogs]], and while she still won't say, she confirms that becoming a were-creature is more the reward for that final action than the trial. 

[[Costi]] gets a sending early in the day, responds back, "7 hours, first small groups, then host - perimeter. With Jamzik - Jezeten scout, perceptive (smell). Female human, black hair. Iounian, stealthy. Colvia's team. Hesitant on violence?"

About an hour before sunset, [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] pulls out a flashing purple rock and says it's show time.
