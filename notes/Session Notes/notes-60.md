# Detailed Notes: Session 60

[[Hugh]] messages [[Giary]] - "Hello, we are in oceantouched tonight. Puzzlers. Can you meet? Party at docks in 16 days. Should go. What is up with sailors", he responds "wow, dick move to leave me like that. It's cool though, having a great time. Lots of new friends, talk..."

We go to bed and in the morning we talk about what we want to say to [[Ellinev Del]]. We also discuss how to handle the [[Laughing Hill]]. Plans made, we head downstairs to breakfast. 

On our way to [[Laughing Hill]], [[Jade]] disguises [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. Arriving, [[Freya]], [[Rez]], and [[Costi]] wait outside while [[Jade]] and [[Hugh]] go in to learn about their beer menu. A small 4 ft tall golden-feather aarakocra is working the bar. She's a little flighty, but eventually goes to get their inventory list to help them pick a beer. 

They talk to the bartender [[Hennurra]], who they tell they're writing a beer guidebook on [[Arkhosia (City)]]. She is sweet but a little confused, and takes them through a great number of beers. [[Hugh]] notices a dwarf paying attention to them, an older man with a lot of gray in his beard. 

[[Rez]] and [[Costi]] go in and pretend to be coordinating an upcoming shippment for "eight barrels of 3434", and when [[Costi]] detects thoughts, he sees a very handsome face in [[Hennurra]]'s mind, with pronounced cheekbones, a cut jaw, blond hair, with a smirk and pointed ears and she thinks "I should let him know, let him know". She says her manager is the one supposed to handle intake, and asks us to come down to meet them. She asks the dwarf [[Zalt]] to watch the bar, he's going through a tough time, his wife just left him. 

Inside the cellar, we see two figures behind desks, one is the elf [[Hennurra]] thought about earlier, who has a scar just under the edge of his left eye, and behind him is a deeply blue tiefling with an eye patch over his right eye, writing in a book. 

The elf asks if the delivery happening tomorrow, with all 8 barrels? Do you know where your next delivery will take place? 

He recommends [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] stops by the [[Starving Stars]] - and ask a colleague of his to "see if they're looking for 3398". We add new entries to our list of [[Goodbarrel Secret Codes]]

Revealed that he's knows it's [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] under our disguises, and we lean in, revealing ourselves and say we didn't know there were friends here so we didn't know if it was safe to be ourselves. 

He introduces us to the tiefling "Cut", this is [[Willum]], he asked how we knew his name. asks why we're doing [[Ulia Glorsbade]]s work, we say she's mean but she asked us to help out and we are. [[Costi]] says he's not sure she's coming to [[Arkhosia (City)]] and [[Willum]] inquires why? We say we don't know. He says anyone "loyal to the cause" doesn't have reason to be worried. We said we couldn't confirm that [[Ulia Glorsbade]] wasn't coming back and we lied to say we didn't know where she was going. (We truly don't know her location, but we do know she was going to be extracted by the [[Goodbarrels]])

[[Willum]] says we should speak with 'everyone' and give our report, says he's sure he'll be there when we give our full report. [[Rez]] says we had to check in with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] first, which is why we've been delayed reporting in. He explains that's part of what they want us to work on -- [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] has access to some new events that they have goals around. 

[[Rez]] asks where we should meet with [[Cinder]]? He says we should meet at [[Flounder's]] tommorrow, evening, dinner. He says he's honored to have met us, as peope who have spilled [[Zalev]] blood. [[Willum]] shares that [[Hennurra]] is one of their best agents, that she's a real chameleon. They leave through the fire, in some sort of magical ability we've never seen before, to leave [[Laughing Hill]] "for the manager". 

We come back out and give the low-down to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], as we head to [[Xixitahn's]]. We buy a scroll of counterspell and silence. We ask where we could buy magical items, he recommends [[Curio's]], he said he'll pass the message along that we want to puruse his wares. We debate where the scrolls with go for a minute, and then [[Freya]] asks where to sell some armor, and he recommends [[The Claw]] as that's where most of the military is. 

We split to shop, [[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] go to [[the Scalded]] for potion while [[Freya]] and [[Jade]] and [[Costi]] go to  [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]] for the book [[Freya]] was given by [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] with the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] in the [[The Unnatural Naturality]]. 

At [[the Scalded]] we sell most of our monster parts, and get a little less than we expected but at a mostly fair place. [[Rez]] also gave him the diamond cream, asked what it is, he says is distilled greater restoration. [[Rez]] asks if he could make a much stronger version, and he says with unlimited funds and magic anything is possible, but is a big asshole. So they storm out, and despite [[Rez]] looking for a potion shop as they travel, they don't find anything.

At [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]] they run into [[Welcome]], who is reading a romance novel. She and [[Costi]] get talking about Sanderson Brando, and ends up asking for us all to hang. [[Freya]] then asks him where he got the [[The Unnatural Naturality]], and if he remembers where he got the book. She says she got it from [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], and they joke about his nature. He tries to remember where he got the book and says from [[Caleb Schleuse]], a former academic and halfling. Last he knew he was living in the [[Driftrock]], and that he was the one who put the markings in the book. He offers to find [[Caleb Schleuse]] for [[Freya]] due to [[Costi]]'s quick understanding of his organizational system. He'll pass any information along to [[Welcome]]. 

We all arrive back at the [[Chapel of the Lost]], and an unmarked note is waiting that says "I would appreciate your attendance after dinner at the [[Garden and Glave]], which you can conviently find in the claw at (cross streets). I'm looking forward to speaking with you."

We go up to our room and talk about our day. [[Freya]] shares her new discovery. [[Jade]] looks to see if she recognizes the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]], and her glasses turn gray. She doesn't remember anything but knows it's important. [[Freya]] also opens up about her note, which had a specific list of people not to trust: [[Freya's mom]], [[Freya's dad]], her mentor [[Balsandor]], or her ex-lover [[Ronan]]. We talk about what she would share with [[Caleb Schleuse]], and also tells us that she never had any crimes. 

[[Costi]] gives [[Hugh]] the books he picked up, which spurs him to look through his existing collection, which seems to spur a memory. He reads a journal, given to their loved one, with a beautifully scripted E, which makes him blank out and drop the book. He doesn't remember anything though. 

[[Jade]] goes and takes the book, [[The Unnatural Naturality]] from [[Costi]]. Seeing it work well, [[Rez]] snags the scroll of silence. [[Hugh]] approaches her and asks if journals are common, they talk about how to preserve memories, and [[Hugh]] decides to start journaling. 

[[Costi]] decides to magically look into the [[Halls of the Dead]], using clairvoyance, and sees a very small room with two people in it, it reminds us of the lift we use in the [[Chapel of the Lost]]. The two figures have a casket, with a row of buttons: it goes up to 12, and down to 50. On the 7th floor, there seems to be desk outside. He uses a key to open it, he kept it in his coat pocket under the ash grab robes they are all wearing. 

We head to after-dinner drinks with [[Ellinev Del]], our dining room already has [[Ellinev Del]] and [[First Officer Ghent]]. They don't look like the world's most enthusiastic dinner guests. We explain some of our concerns, she asks if we're worried about [[Ricci Scrucks]], we say maybe, and then about [[Victor]], and we say we don't think so. She says we arrived into [[Arkhosia]] approximately 2 months ago, which coincided with a great deal of violence. We've been tied to most of it. [[Captain Fretze]] arrived into the city yesterday, which has concerned her. She's still questioning the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]], and she thinks he's not a dumb man. She also knows we've been lying to her. While we might have good intentions, it's hard for her to trust us. We tell her about our role in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]], but don't give up [[Niko]] or [[Winifey]] names. We tell about [[Vigo Underswell]] and [[Norathar Pent]], and tell we went to [[The Furnace]] but don't give up the name or say more other than it's underground. 

She shares that she's been an intelligence officer for a decade, and understand the importance of not acting unless it is for the greatest good. She says if they have their full cooperation, they might able to get us a pardon for all of our crimes, but if she thinks we are doing anything less they will be sure we fall for everything. And they will turn us in if it can prevent a war with [[Zalev]]. She also warns us to be as careful as possible with [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]]. We try to ask her about [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] but she says she cannot discuss him on official time. 

[[Rez]] asks if they've been following us, and they say yes but they weren't the invisible one. They say their future tails will be not invisible, and they'll all wear purple. They also have a record of every luxury card taken in the city. The only way to travel discreetly is renting a mount. They say in a perfect world they'd have at least a week, but a minimum day to prep up people. [[Costi]] mentions that their leaders travel by fire. They will help dig up information on the [[Cloud's Lament]]. They've captured a feel people [[Gurfadi Klisp]] and [[Kapper]]. They have a few names, [[Cinder]], [[Knawfer]], and [[Ahil Sveson]]. 

[[Costi]] asks about [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], and [[Ellinev Del]] says she has a file on him, and he asks for more information if we continue to work with them. He's a potential asset in an enemy country. [[Hugh]] asks about the sword symbol he previously showed her, it was a captains sword decommissioned about 67 years ago.
