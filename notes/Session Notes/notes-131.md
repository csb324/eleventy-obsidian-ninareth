# Detailed Notes: Session 131

We make our way into [[Jezeten]].

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "We are near the gates, where should we enter?" she replies: "whichever is closest, maybe not the barracks. There are escorts at every gate for you"

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] preps [[Sylvia]] not to essentially say anything as we go through security, we're going with the story she was lost in the woods and we helped. 

[[Costi]] is greeted and communicates with the military there who pull us through the line to our waiting escort. We're lead past many fortifications, including a famous boiling pitch moat to the waiting [[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]], a 50 year old halfling, fit with graying neat beard, well groomed. His family is notable in the [[Eberronian First Division]], and seems quite polite. They immigrated here a few generations ago from the [[Narathian Plains]]. 

We dismiss [[Sylvia]], giving her a gold. We'll plan to meet up with her at [[AVAD]] later. 

[[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]] says that we're wanted in the [[Palace Dharinov]], to get an update on "what has happened while we've been in the woods" but isn't authorized to tell us more. He mentions a "joining" of the [[Eberronian First Division]] and [[Eberronian Second Division]].

Eventually, we begin our journey through [[Jezeten]] in what seems to be a moving siege tower, which we learned is designed by [[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]]. The city is nice, roads smooth with clean sidewalks. It's dense, with tall buildings, and surrounded by a stormwall to protect against [[Breakers Bay]]. 

The area around the [[Palace Dharinov]], the [[Dharinov District]] is made up of gorgeous parks, fountains, and essentially no other buildings. It's lots of open land. Notably, we've seen many pedestrians, many armor patrols, almost all [[Eberronian First Division]], but no city guards. 

We pass by [[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]]'s family home, awarded to his father upon his retirement. We learn about his family some, his husband and two children. (14 year old daughter and 4 year old son). 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] enters the [[Palace Dharinov]] and escorted to a wing where we can freshen up before the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] receives us. We check out our surroundings. [[Freya]] finds a magic sensor in each of our rooms that is giving off an aura of divination. [[Costi]] finds a secret entrance, unmanned, hidden in one of our backrooms leading into a tunnel. 

We, secretly, discuss what to say then freshen up. Internally, [[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] make a quick prayer to their respective gods. 

Eventually, [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]'s chamberlain [[Jehneim Bastienev]] comes to escort us. The reception hall has no windows but is filled with candles and made of dark obsidian stone. You enter into a sunken pit with a black glass throne on the far end, risen above the rest of the room. 

On the right side of the throne, [[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]] is there, beside a woman wearing breastplate, heavily decorated, a colonel [[Nacrissa Thrudec]], carrying a staff. Next to her is [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]]. To the left, is [[Colvia Ghul]], next to an older woman in nice civilian clothing, city manager [[Klodec Hyemagu]], along with [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], [[Trisha]], and [[Dania]].

Duchess, says she owes a debt for services, "feels good" when she compliments us, Adrienne notices her final look at Costi being "pointed". There are "developments" in need of her attention (likely our black site infiltration). Adrienne confirms Duchess is undead. Duchess tells us to speak to the chamberlain to receive an award. Teld left with the Duchess.

[[Jehneim Bastienev]] kicks off our smaller group, of the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], [[Colvia Ghul]], and the ? woman. She begins with confirming if [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] intends to remain working with [[Eberron]] under an expanded scope. They want us to take on "a few more tasks at the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]'s discretion". The tasks aren't directly related to [[ELA]]. They understand we'd stay contractors, no firm or long time commitment, but as long as we complete any agreed upon tasks we could leave our contract at any point. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] agrees, and [[Klodec Hyemagu]] is set to write out our future contract. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] then discusses some of her work and where [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] would fit in. 

She says her work with [[Gu’athrithen]] and [[Deregheir]] - about 6 months ago they complained that undead have been spotted along the southern border of [[Turian Waste]]. They allege [[Eberron]] has been sending them intentionally to do damage and harm, but [[Eberron]] claims they did not send them. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] has been trying a diplomatic approach but believes the attack on the ship was an escalation and response to her work. A second, related attack, seems to have happened near where our ship crashed. Some [[Arkhosia]] [[Listeners Party]] members were found there, which would be a worrying sign of increases in tension, though maybe some are acting on their own, or even members of the [[Fire Raisers]].

However, [[Gu’athrithen]] has proven that there have been some powerful undead. While they're not sanctioned from the [[Eberronian Military]] they might be unlicensed practitioners. While typically they would send the [[Bone Breakers]], they're otherwise obligated, so they're asking [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] instead. 

The reports say undead have been spotted primarily in the [[Turian Waste]], beginning closer to the [[Eberron]] border, but is spreading. The draconics of [[Gu’athrithen]] need resolution, and assurance it's not coming from [[Eberron]] - they're worried about war breaking out. [[Deregheir]] has been acting as a facilitator of the conversations. They've been unsuccessful negotiating now, but they hope they'll be an ally. Relations have been strained historically - it's unclear if they'll be helpful should war breaks out.

They'll make us a dossier once the information is reviewed, and they think our starting point would be going to where the last undead were found. They understand if we want to take a few days first, specifically to see [[Costi's mom]] and sister.

If we can track down the necromantic activity source, and stop it - ideally finding proof that it is not intentionally coming from [[Eberron]]. "We can kill whoever we need to kill", and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks for that in writing. She then negotiates our payment some, [[Trisha]] and [[Colvia Ghul]] say they'll see to our supplies, as [[Colvia Ghul]] has spent a good deal of time there. They'll get us to the border and supply us with horses. 

They ask us to let them know where we stay, and recommend [[The Compass Point]]. It's also about 15 minute walk from the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] residence in [[Jezeten]], and we invite [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] and [[Trisha]] for drinks. 

[[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]] reminds us of his offer for dinner, a few days from now, once we're settled at the [[Coldseeker Chateau]]. He points us to a wagon which will take us to our hotel, in it - our additional payment from the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] - 800 gp, 500 gp worth of diamonds. There's also two pins, of [[Dharinov's Cross]] for [[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]].

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Nadia]], "Don’t tell your mother. He wants a surprise. Costi and I are on our way over. Be there is in (real timeline)" she responds, "Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh". We get 4 rooms at [[The Compass Point]]. 

We finally get a few minutes alone, and sweep the room again. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tells us that the chamberlain, [[Jehneim Bastienev]] is also undead. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] talks about what we've heard - we should confirm it is not actually being done by the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], talk a bit about blue dragons, [[Rez]] brings us [[Vask]]'s warmongering 'accident' with the [[Turian Waste]], we better check up on that. Thankfully that's happened more recently than the start of this issue. 

[[Costi]] gets our help to pick a gift for [[Nadia]] for missing her birthday. [[Hugh|Finn]] misses our conversation and sends a letter to the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] to schedule a time to meet. We say we need to defer to their schedule, so [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] uses the circlet: "Hey Sienna, are you available for late drinks or breakfast somewhere secure. Would love to debrief more fully. Letter also coming. Don't worry about it", she replies: "Breakfast is better than drinks, tomorrow 7:45. Come to our house". 

[[Rez]] sendings to a few siblings. [[Vask]] doesn't think he's to blame for any [[Turian Waste]] undead, they killed any they found while they were there. [[Lee]] tells [[Rez]] not to get involved in the [[Gu’athrithen]] / [[Deregheir]] conflict. [[Eirian]] hasn't heard of [[Rughork]] but will look into it. This causes [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] then has LOTS of questions about [[Rez's Family]] and especially [[Rez's Dad]]'s sex life. [[Rez]] doesn't have a lot of answers there, but does try to explain the found family she grew up in and some of the inner-family relationships (spoiler: it's complicated).

We arrive in [[Deal 'Ras]] to visit [[Costi's mom]] and [[Nadia]] in [[AVAD]]. On our trip, we get a good layout of the cities, but surprisingly there isn't crushing poverty anywhere, it's exceedingly clean, and everything is orderly. 

[[Nadia]] pranks [[Costi]], and in return he gives her his hat of disguise. He plays it off for fun at first, but also tells her to take t seriously as protection. He then turns her into a naked mole rat. 

Meanwhile, [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] tells [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Rez]], and [[Freya]] that she's glad we help keep her son alive, but it's hard for her to meet us. She can't stand to lose another member of her family. 

The siblings come down to join us, and we e tell the story of how [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] met, shit on [[Costi]] for still sending [[AVAD]] professors for help, and she spots the evolution of [[Costi's Sword]], and the [[The Raven Queen]] feathers. Guess he should tell her about that... It seems like she knows her way around a sword herself. 

We talk for hours, [[Costi]] and [[Nadia]] continue a prank war, and [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] tells us that [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] always opened a bottle of gin when he came back from adventures. She gives [[Costi]] the bottle.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes upstairs to see [[Costi]]'s room, and things he's loved throughout childhood, including kindergarten toys are displayed. We give him so much shit.

[[Hugh|Finn]] goes to talk to [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] - and gives her the [[Vlad Grosu Patch]] he's carried. [[Hugh|Finn]] says he's [[Costi]]'s personal guard. She reminds him there's no one she trusts more, and she knows [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] would feels the same way. 

It seems like we'll chat more with her about real topics when we go to visit [[AVAD]].

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] reflects on her own siblings, after watching [[Costi]] and [[Nadia]]. We learn she also has a little sister [[Keebi Spout]]. We encourage her to reach out, if she wants, and she agrees to use the [[Circlet of Sending]] tomorrow. She thinks [[Adrienne's Family]] is probably better off without her anyway. We try and disagree. 

In the morning, we go to the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] house, then into their hidden bunker underground - it's thickly coated in lead. They take their security very seriously here. They tell us to try to keep [[Colvia Ghul]] at arm's length as much as possible, but it's clear she's suspicious of us. She works for a secret organization, but as far as we know she reports directly to [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. 

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] confirms she intentionally allowed the diplomacy to fail between [[Eberron]] and [[Gu’athrithen]], and intentionally brought a very expensive airship here. War fermenting there is an excellent excuse to position more [[Eberronian Second Division]] troops into [[Jezeten]] - but it shouldn't progress into full war. However, we should do what we can to actually solve the tension. 

We should stay in [[Jezeten]] for a week so things get more tense, but leave and try to solve it before it boils over. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] genuinely does not know why the undead are appearing, but some of them are of quite powerful. She doesn't know of any with extra limbs or parts atypically. 

We got an update on [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]]. Framing the draconics for the [[blacksite]] worked in our favor, but she's not sure what happened as a result of that attack was. She believes some prisoners were released, at least temporarily, from [[Orzudan]]. However, at least one person that she knew to be 'inactive', [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] is out and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] is out trying to bring her back in. She's a rogue necromancer who's done a lot of harm. It's been 9 years since she was heard from, but appeared in a village near [[Orzudan]].

She believes the blue draconics from [[Gu’athrithen]] were able to get some papers, schematics of some of the border facilities on the desk. Oh noooooo. :) 

[[Costi]] asks if he should tell [[Nadia]] to leave, [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] says not yet - but she should be ready to leave at a moments notice. 

Before we can move on [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]: the conflict in the [[Turian Waste]], [[Who's Undead is That?]] needs to be resolved, [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] needs to be back, more [[Eberronian First Division]] soldiers need to be in place, and a few more pieces need to fall in line. 

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] has spent the last month in [[Deregheir]] but doesn't seem to be genuinely trying to get them involved, which [[Rez]] encourages. She gives [[Costi]] a scroll of teleport circle and shows him their circle so we can get back quickly if needed. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sendings to [[Branton Spout]], who didn't yell - but did ask why [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is in danger.
