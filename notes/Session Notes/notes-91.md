# Detailed Notes: Session 91

[[Freya]] continues following the [[Wayfinders]] path towards the [[Gia'Thoren]] outpost. We make our way mostly quietly. At one point [[Hugh]] and [[Freya]] get distracted by some frogs holding a meeting. She buys her way in with some bugs [[Costi]] has for [[Samuel]]. It's a commerce issue, [[Freya]] votes against the majority, they go back to tariffs. However, she does get a warning as we leave that we should keep a close eye out, there's been some creepy crawlies - a lot of things that used to be like humanoids but gone wrong, with black eyes and gaping wounds that smell like the dead. She ends up convincing him to leave home and explore the world, and [[Guu]] joins [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. 

We discuss on our walk what we'll do in [[Ru'Nileth]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] wants to go to the [[The Boundless Grove]], and [[Freya]] wants to go to the [[Ru'Nileth Wayfinders Outpost]]. We also start to keep an eye out for any zombies or creatures like [[Guu]] described. 

As we walk further, we see a cart that appears shattered with a humanoid leg sticking out. We remember our learned lessons and look the scene over from a distance first. It seems like the crash scene has been here for a day or two, and there's no movement. As we approach, we see that the leg is actually something inside a pant, a thick cord of brown hair springs towards [[Freya]]. 

We're ambushed by the cord of hair, a small bearded creature holding a stone ax, and two undead-appearing giant apes. At one point during the fight, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] goes to use her new [[Yew Sword]], and she's taken to a spot that seems like the [[the Feywild]] and is greeted by [[Corellon Larethian]], to whom she makes her oath: 

	"I am determined to be worthy of the gifts I have been given.  
	With song, I can bring peace to those around me  
	With the sword, I protect his peace from any forces that threaten it.  
	I dedicate my life to his service."

We investigate around after killing them, and the stone creature is slowly dissolving into ash. [[Costi]] seems to think this is an extra-planar creature, with similar ash to [[G'zraad]]. We take his club however. Looking at the wreckage, it seems like it's largely been picked over already. We find a beautiful box, made of githyarti wood, a rare wood sung by [[Gia'Thoren]]. Inside are 10 rings made of the same wood. We discuss if this will count as a favor to [[Zmaj]].

As we make our way back, we (of course) fall into a pit trip [[Zmaj]] sets for us. We camp inside it for the night. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] keeps watch throughout the night. We identify the rings, they are nonmagical, then [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Costi]] are both CONVINCED the club is non-magical. 

When we climb out there's a note left with an arrow pointing us to the [[Gia'Thoren]] outpost. [[Freya]] knows it's the wrong. We spend a long time talking about pranks we could do in revenge, and [[Rez]] shares about her family bracelets. [[Costi]] plans to put him in a ball and roll him away.

On our walk, we do find another polymorphed small creature. [[Freya]] talks to it, and it wants to kill us. [[Guu]] talks about his potential first kill one day. After a days walking, [[Freya]] finds some confusing [[Wayfinders]] symbol that indicates to stop. 

[[Zmaj]] steps out and [[Costi]] immediately puts him into a force cage ball, we start to roll him around mocking him. They're attacks on [[Costi]] don't hit, and [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] gloats HARD. And it very quickly devolves into a brawl. [[Zmaj]] calls his group [[Squad Seven]] to halt. 

We all bicker and then he eventually leads us into the [[Shireneth Outpost]]. We ask what's to do with all the undead, and say how it must be spillover and remnants from our work to [[Heal the Anchor Tree]]. Inside, is 6 githyarti trees sung into an enclosure together. [[Zmaj]] leads us to [[Gia Yola]], a slightly older wood elf, wrinkled skin and gray hair in the armor of the [[Gia'Thoren]]. He says he's been given a heads up about us from [[Zmaj]], and it seems he's heard about our work in [[Weirefesteria]].
