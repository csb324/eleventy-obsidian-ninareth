# Session 159

[[Rez]] and [[Costi]] spend some time trying to create a way to keep the [[ELA Ebony Stake]] in [[Duchess v'Dharinov]], they land on an extremely tight iron bandeau. 

[[Freya]] practices knowing where hearts are, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] helps. She didn't know before but she's now really good at knowing where hearts are.

We plan through how to support each other in our actions and what items to best use for [[A Murder of Dukes]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] shares the bonus potion [[Henrik]] gave her, which prompts a group analysis (we're all equally interested totally) on what [[Henrik]]'s feelings are for [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], because there's clearly something. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] makes it clear that's not how she view him, and compares it to the whiplash it would be if we asked [[Freya]] if she was interested. [[Freya]] is TRIGGERED and crashes out a bit. 

[[Rez]] chaotically connects to her [[Scales of Chaos]] but ends up with two extra sorcery points for the day.

We plan to talk to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] at 8AM tomorrow. 

[[Rez]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] do some sendings:

[[Rez]] -
* [[Zmaj]] - [[Unscaled]]'s notes codebroken!! Headquarters near [[Yent Lake]], [[Fenswick Cove]]?? We'll be there with my people in 5/6 weeks. We should raze it.
	* Deal. Let’s drive these fucks into the ground. [[Thelran Asari]] owes us, I’ll meet you there.
* [[Eirian]] - [[Unscaled]]'s notes codebroken!! Headquarters near [[Yent Lake]], [[Fenswick Cove]]?? DON'T GO. I'll be there with my people in 5/6 weeks. Look out.
	* Think you can make it faster? Nervous they’ll leave soon. We’ll loosely scout it out.
		* Turns out yes! Three weeks? I have SUPER important things going on but I have much more information I’ll tell you with more sendings later
* [[Vask]] - [[Unscaled]]'s notes codebroken!! Headquarters near [[Yent Lake]], [[Fenswick Cove]]?? We'll 5/6 weeks. We should raze it. Can you come? We're killing the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] tomorrow!
	* Ahhh!!!! You’re a little too early, we’ll be in [[Jezeten]] in three weeks! Good luck, and yeah, want a ride to [[Yent Lake]]? Shoot stuff.
		* [[Vask]] I SO DO. Same scales / same brain.

[[Hugh|Finn]] to [[Magister]], "Checking in. May be unavailable in the next few days. Anything of note for you all? My memories are fully restored. Would love to chat soon", he replies, "So good to hear from you, dear friend. Yes, you still in [[Jezeten]]? We’re likely to be there in about three weeks, can talk then."
* "Still in [[Jezeten]]. Unsure how long but hopefully we overlap. I’m sure [[Rez]] is ready to see [[Vask]]. Any news we should be aware of?
	* "Nothing terribly pressing, but I have so many questions for you. Stay safe, my friend." 
		* 283 years of history is nothing to turn your nose at. Looking forward to it. Same to you

[[Freya]] asks [[Hugh|Finn]] to scry on [[Ronan]] to see if he's with [[Petra]]. The spell doesn't go through, but [[Freya]] confides in [[Hugh|Finn]] how much it bothers her. She is afraid to know more, but knows it is for the best. They debate the value of anger in coping here. It ends up in some denial. 

[[Freya]] ends the night asking [[The Curator]] for visit. Later that night, they come for a visit. They tell [[Freya]] to keep checking her blood, that "as soon as investments in science are made" it could be useful, and potentially as soon as tomorrow. [[Freya]] also tries to get more info on the chains and [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]], [[The Curator]] plays dumb. [[Freya]] floats some growing mistrust on her point for the first time - [[The Curator]] says it's very important to hold onto their code. [[Freya]] asks why they have interest in her, they say she's special, "in ways they think she'll find out one day". [[The Curator]] pushes off her ask for more info on [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]], they say they don't have much north of the [[Liveth forest]]. [[Freya]] asks her to give [[Petra]] nightmares tonight. [[Freya]] mentions that if she dies she'll come hang out with [[The Curator]], which is concerning. Also asks them where they live, they say it's not on the [[Material Plane]], can't eat and hasn't been able to for a long time, and sorta exists outside of space and time. They tease if [[Freya]] keeps their partnership, they can tell her more about their long term plans. [[The Curator]] also warns that [[Freya]] should not take the choice of death, and moreover the choice of coming back, quite so lightly. Even they have died once, it was how when they became who they are. 

[[Rez]] asks [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] if she thinks we have any play to help make [[Colvia Ghul]] not join our fight, talking through different information we could dangle or outright tell as a trade. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] divines to [[TrueSilver]], asking "What can I or the [[The Unforged Few]] do to prevent the most loss of life tomorrow while still accomplishing our personal goal of killing the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]? Love you." The fire immediately goes out, he can see a light apparition lightly glowing silver of a humanoid figure, who walks up into the fire, strikes a stone a relights the fire. He feels like this image has a job and does it quickly. 

[[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] have a middle of the night moment, they each hopes the other doesn't die. Aw.

[[Hugh|Finn]] also does some in his feels communications, to [[Terrav]] - "Something I need to mention before tomorrow. I’m not a person who loves lightly. I want to see you again. Please be safe", he responds, "I will, and you too. I found something for you, and I want to get it to you soon."

In the morning, [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes to see [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]. We review the plan, and [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] shares that [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] will likely be sheltering in her saferoom "a crypt generally under the throne room". It's probably safe to assume that [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]]'s tunnel will come out in the basement. She warns that if there's any shred of doubt of our purpose, they cannot be allowed to live. She thinks it's likely [[Jehneim Bastienev]] will be there, but the more successful the [[ELA]] are in their [[ELA Day of Action|Liberation Day]] attacks, the more people will be pulled away from the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]] in particular is a swing. She also warns that she'll be following a couple hundred feet behind us, but will not step in to save us for the story. We'll clarify our story afterwards based on how things shape out. 

On the way to the party, we come up with a last minute plan to try and dose [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] with mushrooms. [[Freya]] starts tracking the storm, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] plan to closely watch party goers to track when news of [[ELA Day of Action|Liberation Day]] attacks begin. 

The party is very well attended, several hundred people. Some people we recognize jump out, [[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]] and [[Aaeron Coldseeker]], [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], [[Marius A]], [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], and [[Trisha]]. Several of those folks also clock us as we walk in. 

We try to behave normally, other than beginning to steep all four of the strange underdark mushrooms in a bloody mary. Normal! For us. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] becomes the life of the, already pretty great, party. We play it cool, say hi to acquaintances, and congratulate [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]].  [[Freya]] sneaks off with [[Hae Coldseeker]] to climb trees. [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]] relieves [[Marius A]] for half an hour to socialize with us before returning to his post. 

[[Rez]] finally sees [[Fingers]]. They have a bit of a flirty exchange, and hands off the bloody mary for [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] - agreeing it will both be more fun and also help tonight go more smoothly. [[Rez]] gives [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] the heads up that she's agreed, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] wasn't already watching or anything. 

Surprising the room, [[Duchess v'Dharinov]], [[Jehneim Bastienev]], and [[Nacrissa Thrudec]] show up to congratulate [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]]. The Duchess pulls him into a private room, we catch a look of shocked pride on his face. 

Meanwhile, [[Freya]] teaches [[Hae Coldseeker]] how to choose a tree to climb. She also teaches her about gruung. 

[[Fingers]] successfully gets [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] to drink the laced bloody mary. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] notices that, but then is distracted, as [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] walks in beside none other than [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]]. She goes in to greet him. It seems like [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] has told him both about his hunt for [[Niko]] and intimates perhaps more about [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is trying to gain [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]]'s loyalty, as a 'mad dog'. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] comes and saves her. 

[[Fingers]] catches up with [[Freya]]. She's roooooolling - not worried about her ability to fight though. They make plans to meet up later tonight, to celebrate, perhaps with another round of mushrooms. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] comes up, and asks if [[Fingers]] has a goal of sleeping with our whole party. She makes a pitch to make it [[Hugh|Finn]] next - she'd never reach her goal if he's the last hold out. [[Fingers]] seems to see something... a red pulsating line between the two of them. Though it's hard to know what with all the mushrooms. [[Fingers]] decides it might be [[Rez]] afterall.

[[Freya]] is having some difficulty finding [[Hae Coldseeker]]. After finding her, she's successfully able to manipulate the 7 year old into showing her how to get into the grandfather clock, but gets busted by poor stealth and pivots to screaming ribbit from the roof. 

Outside, [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] comes to approaches [[Costi]], after thoroughly insulting him, he requests lunch and warns that he's nothing if not generous - with his friends. He's leaving [[Jezeten]] tomorrow. He very lightly threatens [[Costi's mom]]. As he leaves, he says, next time [[Costi]] visits [[Henrik]], to tell him [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] says hello.

As soon as [[Costi]] is alone, [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] descends. He shares that he has been in several conversations where [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] has been present, trying to get people to take the threat of [[Niko]] seriously. He asks [[Costi]] if he has any information he'd like to share, at [[Costi]]'s refusal, he says he thought he'd give him a chance to make bygones be bygones. When [[Costi]] says he's not going to make something up, [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] calls that respectable. He heads off to talk to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]].

[[Hugh|Finn]] finds [[Costi]], who then find [[Fingers]]. She really hits on [[Hugh|Finn]], who does not bite. [[Costi]] points her in the direction of [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]], and hands her the heroin he originally took from her party. [[Hugh|Finn]] makes a threatens her with sobriety, and she breaks her act to say she has to act as is expected. [[Fingers]] then leans into her trauma the tiniest amount, trapping [[Hugh|Finn]] into agreeing to talk to her about it, #helpmedaddy 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] has a bit of a heart to heart with [[Starstool Daygrip]]. She convinces him to give her one of his items, he gives her his 'lucky silver' - the first he ever earned while busking. And of course, for all the free advice, she needs a little favor. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] commissioned [[Rez]]'s [[Necklace of brass dragonscales]]. She wants to know where he got it, as [[Rez]] likes it so much. He agrees to connect her. He's so appreciative. Poor guy. 

At that point, we hear a far away explosion, and watch as three of tenements come crashing down. The storm is immediately rushing into the city. [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]], [[Fingers]] and [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]  immediately switch into military mode. 

We 'check-in' with [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]. [[Fingers]] reports that two gates have fallen, garrisons have been taken hostage, and there have been explosions all over the city. [[Trisha]] gives us a sending stone, and he tells us to "do what we do best and go kill some terrorists".

[[Rez]] messages [[Aaeron Coldseeker]], but he either doesn't bite or doesn't seem to know about the clock. We head down into the basement. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] cast pass without a trace and we make it downstairs. [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Freya]] don't note anyone paying us attention or following.

We find the grandfather clock, but [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] are able to make out how to crack the mechanical aspects of the clock. We race down the tunnel, and after several minutes we run into an empty doorway, noticing magic on the door. A bell sounds, and the doors both ahead and behind us slam shut and lock. 

Gems on the walls around us begin to glow dimly behind glass panels. The room is evil. It hurts us and we hate it. 

[[Freya]] carries [[Hugh|Finn]] as we keep running so he can heal us.
