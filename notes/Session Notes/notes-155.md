# Detailed Notes: Session 155

We start by talking about how [[Marius Lupu]] got in, he says he came in Unit 398. 

Command word to stick, goes invisible, each one has two things on either end, one with a magic mouth so the command word can blow them up from anywhere in the city. If anyone disrupts them, the gem automatically transports them back to the [[ELA]] base. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] abruptly leaves, claiming he "heard something". [[Rez]] joins him for the buddy system, soon joined by [[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]].

[[Marius Lupu]] and [[Costi]] have a bit of a heart to heart about if [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] are good people. Marius is a bit skeptical about our goals, and our loyalty given that we aren't from [[Eberron]]. 

When we try to get [[Marius Lupu]] to agree to get zone of truthed, he shows lots of hesitancy, and ends up slipping that while HE trusts [[Costi]] lots of the others don't. He's really thrown off by [[Costi]]'s official uniform. We push off the confrontation and agree to 'go plant the bombs'. He leads up to 1710, the first target. He has three to plant. 

On the way, he says on [[ELA Day of Action]] they'll go off, with some caved off exits, and funnel them out next to military enclosures. 

Right as we were about to plant the first bomb, [[Rez]] casts modify memory. It works! We get his target units: [[Hugh|Finn]] confiscate the three bombs.

[[Rez]] implants the memory that we all readily agree to plant the bombs, are enthused about our duty, we all go together to plant the bombs - beginning with the farthest ones first and end at this one, and are having him come back to awareness near his entrance. She adds a moment of being so charmed by [[Rez]], and ends with feeling better about [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]],  less concerned about our loyalty than before, and happy to have run into us.

As we approach where he's ending, we ask how in hiding he is as a whole, and we learn his code name is [[Stenvrik]]. He tells [[Costi]] to come by [[The Cellar]] before [[ELA Day of Action]], maybe 2 nights before? We say our good byes and tell him to lay low. 

We decide to report in to [[Jehneim Bastienev]], [[Hugh|Finn]] sends, "11 of 12 vampires freed are dead, killed a clawed bone creature. One mimicry vampire, [[Wenric]], unaccounted, still searching. [[ELA]] defeated, uncovered bomb plot.", she replies, "Thank you. Report back to the palace."

[[Jehneim Bastienev]] meets us in the room we've are ferried into back at the palace. But before we can get started [[Colvia Ghul]] surprises everyone, and joins in to overhear our report. Midway through, [[Freya]] is struck down with terrible stomach pains - we were told we couldn't intervene. [[Hugh|Finn]] really struggled but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] finished our report. [[Colvia Ghul]] was very intrigued about the bone creature we killed, asking about his clothes. When [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tried to ask more, she said it "answered a question she had for a while". 

Knew marisu cover
would move military away let the ela bombs go off

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], "Deeply need to debrief. Also need [[Costi]]’s requested info. Any chance you are free tonight/soon? I would also love to see [[Dania]]", he replies, "Tonight won’t work, tomorrow is tough. But [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] comes back day after tomorrow, we’re having a little get together. Come by then?"

We decide on a girls night, but then decide there's no where fun to go, and go buy drinks and snacks to get drunk in our house. 

Meanwhile [[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] have a heart to heart about how they're both struggling to cope with the challenges in [[Eberron]]. 

The girls come back, folks double back flip because why the hell not, [[Rez]] realizes she can help teach [[Costi]] how to use his new wings, then [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] have excess energy meet soft giggly wine drunk. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Marius Lupu]] that his cover was already blown, they knew about him already, and to stay underground. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]], "Hellooooooo, we have NEW INTEL (too much for sending). Can we chat? Anything new we should know? Duchess knows much already, [[Marius A]] cover blown.", he replies, "We suspected it was! His last job was messy. And sure! Tomorrow night works?", "Sure! Later is better, we've got a party. Like cool middle of the night meeting - after 1? Tell us where!", he replies, "Well um, I could probably come to you? Where is the party?", "Uhhhhh I'm ALWAYS saying the more the merrier but it's not MY party to invite you too. Come to our house after", "Oh okay, I could use a safe house near where your having a party. I'm not coming to your house that's dangerous", then he sends back asking for the district where our party will be so we can meet at a safe house near there. Right.  He sends us an address. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Father Thronestone]], "Helllooooo, I'm gunna be BUSY in a few days. How close are you? No rush!!! Except if you're arriving in more than 6... then rush." he replies, "Day after tomorrow, I'll be there! It's been a long few weeks, sorry for the delay."

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]], "Still not in jail? Just checking", he replies, "Still not in jail! Back to my training routine. You still not in jail?", he says, "Shockingly, not in jail. Please be safe. For [[Costi]]'s sake. I’ll do my part". [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] responds, "Thank you, Finn. I’ll do my best."

Adrienne sends to [[Henrik]], "Hey. We’re planning to be in AC in 2 days. If you can find time, would love to catch up." He responds, "I think I can adjust my schedule for you."

We relax for the morning, then head to the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]]. The party is already in swing, but we're asked to heads upstairs to talk to the family. There are some familiar faces there, [[Fingers]] and [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] and [[Dania]] and [[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]]. As we're about to arrive, we hear raised voices inside. As we knock and step inside, the vibe is uncomfortable. [[Trisha]] is standing apart from the rest of the family, and it seems like [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] were standing opposite each other in conflict. While we they all readjust, it seems like [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] is still actively carrying anger - meanmugging [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] occasionally. 

We congratulate [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] on his new accomplishment, and agree it was good that this dangerous [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] is behind bars. They give an update on their research into the [[ELA]], but have noticed no organizational increase in violence or other escalation. In other Duchies, some of the attacks are more violent than ours. 

We share about the tunnels. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] recognizes that the creature is a bone claw. If someone powerful tries to become a lich, but it goes wrong, it corrupts and gets bound to a nearby powerful person. They can't be killed and will come back. He thinks this one must be back with it's creator by now. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] asks us to let them know if we can't convince the [[ELA]] to stop the bombs from going off. 

The conversation ends with us planning to leave, [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] asks [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] if he's ready for tonight, and with constrained anger, he tells her yes.

[[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] escorts [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], so of course [[Rez]] goes with [[Trisha]]. Nothing is awkward at all. 

[[Freya]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] go to chat with [[Fingers]] and [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]]. [[Fingers]] suggests a game, whoever can put the most interesting object in [[Rez]]'s pocket before the end of the night wins - but if she notices they're out. [[Freya]] immediately has a conversation with [[Guu]] and asks him for his ideas. 

We learn that [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] plans to be in town for about a week, [[Fingers]] as well. [[Fingers]] says she'll take [[Freya]] to the best pie shop she's ever been to. [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] connect on their diverging roles in the [[Eberronian Military]] given their similar traumas. One as a moral guide and one as a weapon. 

[[Costi]] sees [[Freya]] scheming and decides he wants in on the game. [[Freya]] doesn't want to let him play, but when he has the great idea to polymorph HER into the targets pocket, she says they should practice on [[Rez]]. Using invisibility and the help of [[Samuel]], it works easily. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] takes time to right a mystery note, and after casting enhance ability, naturally slips it right into a fold of [[Rez]]'s dress. 

[[Trisha]] and [[Rez]] have a catch up, talk about their brothers, their duties, and finding the fun in things. [[Rez]] brings up their family conflict, and she says it's a small thing in the broader story, and [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] isn't often wrong, [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] will come along. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] circulates with [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]], and learns [[Lieutenant Stradvarth Coldseeker]] is now [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]]. He's got a party coming up! 

[[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] pulls [[Costi]] aside to run and grab some bottles from the cellar. Pulling him into the lead room, says welcome to the family. He shares that none of the [[Bone Breakers]] are in the [[the Matron's Conspiracy]], and only one other is in [[Eberron]]. He shares that the [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] expedition was truly a success. He hopes that he, himself, will be the [[First Sword]] of [[The Raven Queen]] before too long. It's been passed down in their family for generations. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] chats with [[Fingers]], who is making a small bomb to go off in 30 minutes. From [[Rez]]'s pocket! She invites [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to join the game. 

Everyone joins for dinner, and the senior [[Groups and Organizations/Burbanks|Burbanks]] join the party. Halfway through dinner, a bomb suddenly explodes against her thigh, tearing off her skirt, as a recently transformed [[Freya]] flies through the air. Shouting "I win!" she hoists [[Rez]] up onto her shoulder. 

Up in [[Trisha]]'s room, as [[Rez]] goes to pick out an outfit, a note flies out of [[Rez]]'s dress. Reading it, it says, "I want to be more than casual friends" signed [[Trisha]]. [[Rez]] awkwardly attempts to play it off while asking if it's real, [[Trisha]] is very clear she only does casual. Cool, exactly [[Rez]]'s plan. They discuss who might've written the note, it's between [[Hugh|Finn]], presumably to get [[Rez]] to introspect, or [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], as revenge for when [[Rez]] did the same prank with [[Vask]]. This prompts [[Trisha]] to ask if anything is happening with between the two, [[Rez]] says it's unclear, oh wait - you meant sleeping together? Yea that's happening. [[Trisha]] suggests acting heartbroken to help [[Rez]] sleuth out the note-author.

Back with [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], [[Rez]] dramatically tells the story as though she believes it. [[Hugh|Finn]] cracks, and of course, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] plays it so cool, and [[Freya]] loudly laments about the lifelong pain of heartbreak to try and guilt [[Hugh|Finn]]. The group moves to discussing if this is normal or how people date and everyone is speaking for various angles. [[Rez]] goes to congratulate [[Fingers]] on the prank, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] calls out [[Hugh|Finn]] without saying much.

We round out the night and head to meet the [[ELA]]
