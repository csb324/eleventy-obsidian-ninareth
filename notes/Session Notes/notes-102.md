# Detailed Notes: Session 102

We wake up and do an inventory sweep to be prepared for our expected fight tonight, divvying out potions, items, and firming spells. 

Then [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] uses the circlet to send to [[Trisha]], "Sting operation under barracks tonight. [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] and at least two others in military involved. afterward, 11ish, meet at barracks. Will try to take her alive." She responds, "Understood, I coincidentally have a meeting in the barracks at 10:20. Try to keep the building intact."

 We draft a report for [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] saying, our mole got us an introductory conversation to some members but we need time to prove ourselves before they'll let us in for information or to meet [[Shari]]. We plan to spend today to recon and build relationships at the [[Founding Flagon]] to make the needed inroads into this criminal underground. 

On our way to the [[Founding Flagon]], we swing by the [[Viliki Boneyard]] to say hi to [[Pooka]]. [[Hugh]] gives him a knitted scarf. In return he gets some moldy cheese. [[Hugh]] spends some time playing checkers with him, accompanied by [[Rez]]. We learn a little bit more about his life. As we leave, they discuss if undead have souls, or if it even matters. 

At the bar, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] overhears that the [[Eberronian Military]] arrested some folks last night. She talks to the bartender [[Nicky]] about it. It seems like it was only 3 people, but there was a lot of force, like 25 military police, seems like they were expecting more resistance or a different result. The pick-up was around 11. After some chatting about our reputation, and the friends we're making it all sorts of different parts of time, he asks us to give him a heads up on any plans to raid their bar.

We pass time, [[Costi]] practices lock-picking, we talk [[Hugh]] into knitting himself a cardigan, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] plays the harp, and using her raunchiest set it gets us free drinks for the day. [[Rez]] takes her stab at the knife game with [[Garida]] and wins 3 gold, but has to nurse it off with a beer after. 

That evening we meet up with [[Marina Alduchev]]. We invent the fire department. Asking about the arrests, it seems like they picked up some of the [[Shari's Boys]] from a safe house in the North. We worry this is where [[Halv]] has been, though are relieved it seems like most of the larger group staying there was not present. She seems to fish for information about any plans for the night, but we put her off. [[Costi]] gets the sense she's close to [[Nicky]] but not necessarily part of [[Shari's Boys]], though it's not impossible to imagine. [[Marina Alduchev]] really pushes about being read in if she could be helpful, and we consider it. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] cuts in to ask her to take us around town to see their development sites. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tells [[Rez]] that while [[Marina Alduchev]] loves drama, she also sees a genuine care about [[Viliki]] and thinks she might be helpful tonight, and we need to be more isolated to even talk about any details. [[Freya]] and [[Hugh]] spot someone tailing us for a brief moment, but it seems like a [[Shari's Boys]] guy rather than from the [[Eberronian Military]]. 

We try to get a better read on [[Marina Alduchev]]. She seems to genuinely like helping people, comes from money, but has no interest in staying in [[Viliki]] long-term - she just thinks this is a good career move. [[Costi]] pushes her on her real goals and it seems she wants success but also wants people to be better off than they are now. 

Trying to test if she's got any fighting prowess, [[Rez]] faints mis-throwing an apple at Freya to hit her and see her response, but she seems both quick and adept at hiding it. Quickly gauging the group, we decide to see if she's capable enough to hold her own. She pushes back that she's maybe more of a supplier. 

We kill 45 minutes at [[The Mountain's Kiss]] before going to get our "party supplies" from [[Marina Alduchev]]. There are 3 vials: 2 potions of necrotic resistance and a potion of superior healing. There's also an arrow with a note attached, "This should make sure that beings stay in their true form" - we decide [[Freya]] will use it like a dagger. 

After doling out goodies, we go to the safe house from the night before to meet [[Shari's Boys]]. [[Shari]] warns us that it seems like the [[Eberronian Military]] deciding to make their move, and we may be walking into an ambush. They picked up another 6 of their members today. There are tunnels underground that lead directly to barracks secret lab. A member of [[Shari's Boys]] named [[Misha]] will be our escort. 

They offer for us to walk behind the cart or ride in the boxes. We decide to have [[Freya]] look like [[Misha]] when we're close, [[Rez]] will be outside invisible, and the rest of our party will be in the boxes. We all chug our hour long potions and do any long-lasting prep. We load up and take off.

We arrive at the lab, [[Misha]] runs away, and as we enter we see [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim]]. She leads us in, and we are first hit with a strong smell of rot and decay - there are a number of corpses chained to the wall, and some still on their way. The two junior officers [[Costi]] mentioned are in the room, and the vampire we previously killed is there. Behind him, 9 open corpses are pinned to the wall, we recognize [[Chai]] and the [[Shari's Boys]] face we met last nice. There's also a large box in the room that is shaking a bit. 

[[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] smalls talks with [[Freya]] for a minute, and turns to get "us what we're owed". Panicking, she shouts NOW as soon as her heads turns. As many things happens all at once, [[Shay]] steps out.

We gather to revivify Freya, and unknowingly to us, as she's dead [[The Curator]] takes some effect. She feels warm, wet, chill, then a bounce, cold, hot, and a sudden piercing chill in the small of her back, vine drifts past reach, hers frog croak, shes in a space. lines start to arc across her and light up. 

[[Hugh]],  see so much more in her, not just for fighting - perception (21)
[[Rez]], this was a hell of a party but we have so much more fun to have, takes a lendith shot and gives one to her too - persuasion (31)
[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], says she knows part of her can hear this, plays the harp that was ambient music in her death - performance (28)
[[Costi]], gets out his spell ink and tries to tattoo chronurgy magic into her tattoo - arcana (29)

The wounds on her body begin to knit, the vampire piercings heal. As we watch, the diamond dust absorbs into her, the magic stills and then [[Freya]]'s chest rises and she takes a deep breath.

As we're excitedly de-briefing, talking about the bomb with [[Freya]]'s retroactive excitement, [[Hugh]] notices the flesh monster starting to move, but we all surround him and be sure he's DEAD dead. 

We start to search the area, [[Costi]] ghostly gazes and finds lead panels in the walls, with wall safes behind them. [[Freya]] rips out the panels, but they're locked. [[Costi]] looks at the bodies, and healed into her flesh multiple times. In it is a key, which seemingly disarms the traps at the same time. In it, is a serious of documents. There are 163 false necromantic registries, two names jump out [[Oola]], [[Agatha Krunderstone]], from [[Garida]] group, and [[Mim]]. There are also a few letters, between someone in [[Burston Courtev]], [[Jezeten]] and [[Salid]], [[New Fairhaven]], with their addresses. They talk about the flesh-stitched behemoth (FSB), and [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] could keep the prototype but they've made two others. 

[[Hugh]] gets all of the bodies ready for burning. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] divine senses and finds lots of necromantic energy in the room. We look around, and take [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]]'s sword. [[Freya]] still has the same little pinprick. 

[[Rez]] finds a trap door, opens it expecting something fun, but finds a starving tortured gnome man. He's naked and trapped in the cupboard, clearly he's been forced to reanimate bodies. He's not clear and obviously terrified, we just try to encourage him to sit and wait. 

[[Costi]] looks for any interesting information and books about undead. We discuss splitting up the group to try and find [[Trisha]], but decide to cast a hut and take a short rest. We talk a bit to him, and confirm it's [[Zesnel Ponner]]. As we wait, we read all of the secret materials. The letters connect [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] to several people within the [[Eberronian First Division]] who wanted to expand their influence in the Duchy. 

We get just a small amount of strength back. [[Hugh]] opens the door for [[Costi]] to send an arcane eye on recon so we can describe where we are. It travels a decent distance, and then gets to a locked door, [[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] go, disarm the traps. We hear two guards talking on the other side of the door, but go for it. We bluff our way with the writ of authority, and tell them to get [[Trisha]] and it works! 

[[Trisha]] brings a significant number of guards as they get to work. We hand [[Zesnel Ponner]] off to her too, and with significant kindness gets him taken care of. Upon hearing that [[Freya]] died, she immediately checks to see if she's undead. 

Sending us off to rest, we plan to talk further tomorrow - we need to meet at the barracks at dawn. 

As [[Freya]] takes a bath at the end of the night, she notices that the cold spot from [[The Curator]], but as she investigates her hand moves into the flesh. It's not painful, but she touches something metal, right by her spine. She feels a door, and opening it, finds a diamond. She thinks it's a gift.
