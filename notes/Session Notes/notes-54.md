# Detailed Notes: Session 54

For recap, see also:

We wake up and [[Freya]] shares that she finished [[Kith and Kin]] from [[Rawley]]. We talk a little bit about that and then A LOT about elves. [[Costi]] says when he was looking at some of the clues, he could see the sentence left "White Dragon Egg Risen", and asks about where white dragons are, the North?? [[Jade]] tells us about Jadeeza and that she hasn't been seen since [[The Three Dragons War]], but she thinks that's bullshit. [[Costi]] thinks he's on the right track, but he's missing something - though maybe small, really important. 

We talk through who all we need to sending to, [[Rez]] listed several family members, [[Ghez Yhutl]], and also [[Father Thronestone]], [[Freya]] wants to talk to [[Rawley]], and [[Costi]] wants to ask his mom about [[Kith and Kin]]. We agree to share the [[Circlet of Sending]].

[[Freya]] talks to a tree for a change of pace, and problematically introduces it to alcohol. Oops? She tells the group the same hippo 'joke' she told the tree and we go off on tangents for a while, until we come upon a wagon on the side of the road missing a wheel. We discuss if it's a trap, and after [[Samuel]] does some recon we send a silent image of [[Hugh]] to spring any traps.

Short, with lightly green skin dwarf (but tall for a dwarf) with heavy gray beard step pops out cautiously with a crossbow, named [[Dwuarva]]. They've broken their spindle, and seems open to help though tentative. A similar looking woman with only light tuffs of hair with a long braid down the small of her back is with him, named [[Kwurva]]. Their family runs a shop called [[Weavers Worn Wears]], an antique shop (the younger brother [[Twurva]] runs the shop). She says she's always got interesting things, and tells us about their inventory. She shows us [[Cracker]], a reinforced crowbar that can be swingable and also is good at opening doors, [[Giary]] pays 550 gold for it. 

When she sees [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s name on our carriage she asks if we can make an introduction. She says she has something he might be interested in, a scroll that looks like a tapestry - three people from the back, it looks like something from history. 

After watching [[Giary]] and [[Kwurva]] flirt, [[Costi]] asks for some advice and gets consoled on his break up with [[Qik]]. We end up talking a lot about sex and norms. [[Rez]] offers to be [[Costi]]'s wingwoman. We eventually make camp, and settle in. 

[[Rez]] and [[Freya]] play boulder, parchment, shears to see who gets the [[Circlet of Sending]] - after going double or nothing (which [[Freya]] DEFINITELY understood), [[Rez]] gets it for the next two days. 

[[Hugh]] sendings to [[Father Thronestone]] and says "Hello, [[Father Thronestone]], how is reinstation? Have you cracked the dragon notes? Is there still harp music? Say hi to the hearthens", he replies "Hi! good to hear from ya. Yes, reinstated, happily, I might add. Haven't checked, I'll say hi. No update yet soon." [[Rez]] sendings to [[Rez's Family]] (her sister) about [[Pleetos Alentas]]. 

[[Giary]] talks about a lost love, [[Rainn]], about 12 years ago. She was a student at [[Redscale]], played the fiddle. She got an offer to play in an orchestra in [[Thelran Asari]]. Says he still can't listen to the fiddle, and doesn't much like the rain. This spurs a game of What The Fuck Is Up Is That. He asks [[Jade]] what is the greatest loss she's experienced.

She talks about when she moved to [[Thalfar]] with her two friends, who she also was intimate with, and they all planned to live together. One of her friends, [[Shoshata]] who is magnetic and exciting but a bit flighty and [[Esshoui]] a very stable responsible person. [[Jade]] thinks she joined a cult and murdered her neighbor and maybe a lot more. On nights with a moon, which is a big deal there, she was always out with the new friends who seemed very Yuan-Ti Supremicists, didn't like [[Jade]]. Her lizardfolk who was a bad neighbor mysteriously disappeared, and when she tried to investigate she learns [[Shoshata]] did this with her new friends as a sacrifice to [[Sseth]], a snake risen-god who wants to eat the world, often worshipped by yuan-ti. They got in a big fight and haven't talked since. 

We also talk about [[Rez]]'s reason for traveling, how [[Costi]] would choose between his political beliefs and his dad, [[Freya]]'s growing mark from [[The Curator]], and [[Jade]]'s favorite desert. [[Hugh]] will also start making a sweater for [[Giary]].

[[Rez]] also gets a message on her bracelet, that just reads "Taji". As [[Hugh]] takes over watch, he asks if [[Rez]] got good news, and she says yes -- her brother is stupid. [[Hugh]] is confused and she tries to explain that when you have siblings, it's good for them to lose if it means you win.
