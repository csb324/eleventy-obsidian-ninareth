# Detailed Notes: Session 120

[[Lukan]] calls out [[Freya]], saying she doesn't need to die with rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] - she has the makings of one of [[Teld's Dogs]], if she chooses to join them. 

[[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] clearly begins the conflict at war with who to side with, leaning towards the [[Teld's Dogs]] but has significant disgust for them.

[[Hugh]] comes out with the names of fall friends, that [[Lukan]] killed - [[Christine]] [[Annabelle]] ?

[[Rez]] makes a play for [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] to side with [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], saying, "It wouldn’t be us if there wasn’t drama, don’t you want to know our secret orders?? You KNOW we’re infiltration experts, and we’re SUPER GOOD AT IT. These monsters are clearly kill first, think never." And then to [[Lukan]] - you’re gunna get in troooubbllleeee. Or maybe not, since you’re an ally we don’t really mind to kill"

[[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] agrees to help us, saying to [[Rez]], "no more lies. If we kill the dogs, can I go?" who replies "Yes. And I'll tell you the biggest secret you've ever heard", agreeing "if you don't come through that counts as a lie" 

[[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] also seems to have a grudge against the werefox, saying "This is for [[Tanem]]".

[[Freya]] absolutely bodies people, using [[Blow Em]] and gravity as her friends. When that's not enough, [[Costi]] turns her into a giant ape.

[[Lukan]] took [[Hugh|Finn]] down, taunting him, "you forgot [[Nikolas]]... and [[Costi]]", [[Costi]] however knocks [[Lukan]] down to 1 hp with a fireball and the line, "I don’t need to see you to burn you alive!!"

[[Frey-Ape]] seals the deal but ripping his arms off, finally getting her coveted claws (arms).

Afterwards, we tell [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] the truth that we're working to take down the [[Eberronian Military]]. She tells us the final test for [[Teld's Dogs]] is to murder someone you love, and eat of the flesh. She plans to fake her death and flee to [[Thelran Asari]], and gives her dagger to us. We ask if [[Colvia Ghul]] might be cool like her, the answer is no. [[Costi]] gives her the [[Sezathkathon]] coin if she travels in the underdark. It seems like her life is in tatters and decides to preserve herself first and fully flees [[Eberron]].

We search through the bodies, on [[Lukan]] we find [[The Rippers]], a cloak with etching around the edges, 48 platinum, superior healing potion, and sewn into the inside of [[Lukan]]'s armor we find a 6x6 square of folded black silk fabric, blank except for a perfectly spherical drop of blood. On the others, a runed dog axe, a jar of pickled human fingers, 148 gold. Regular potion, dog scimitar, vials of light green poison - 6, 24 platinum. Spell book from the caster, a magic ring, bag of assorted gemstones, 17 gold. Dog shortsword, dog dagger, dog shortbow, vials of poison dark green - 12, sewn into her pants 140 platinum. Dog mace, holy symbol of [[Loviatar]], prayer book with skin flags pinned in. A dog shortbow, wearable modified warforged arms, 45 gold. 

On [[Sinkerk]], a shield with dark energy, magical longsword, and magical ring, and a holy symbol of [[Pelor]].

We keep all of [[Sinkerk]]'s stuff other than the [[Pelor]] symbol, and keep gold worth 2030, the bag of gems, and the spellbook, one warforged bracer

[[Freya]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] go get bodies, while [[Rez]] and [[Costi]] make a bomb. Then we run it all back

We come up with a quick plan:
[[Costi]] modified [[Freya]]'s memory while [[Rez]] does [[Hugh|Finn]]'s, then [[Rez]] does [[Costi]]'s -- we were searching for [[ELA]] leadership like instructed, [[Rez]] and [[Freya]] are overcome by horrors at one point in the search, and it really stays with [[Freya]], heading into the center of town we hear an explosion, [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] scouts ahead and says for us to come after her if we don't hear back, when we don't we go into explore, and see most of  [[Teld's Dogs]] and [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]] dead, with a few heavily wounded and fighting a group of [[ELA]] including a key leader who was super strong, [[Sinkerk]] who was one of the ones who kidnapped us. We tried to join in and were able to overcome them, but not save everyone. On the body of [[Sinkerk]] we were able to recover a box 5 switches, that seem to activate major explosions across the city as well as within the caravans, and the wounded in the camp. We also found a map of three more [[ELA]] camps scattered across the city. We pulled what we could from our fellow soldiers and immediately asked where we could report in with our findings and major losses.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sends to [[Colvia Ghul]]: "Needed to report, significant losses, and significant urgent information with [[Eberron]] trap locations" , she replies, "I'm so glad to hear you all are safe, hold up in the town hall. Things are quiet right now".

We sneak our way, less than a minute away, to the [[Golstrava]] town hall. We give [[Colvia Ghul]] [[Jamzik Zodevzo|Jamzik]]'s dagger and break the news to her. Stressing the urgency, we give the planted information. [[Hugh|Finn]] is able to see she is still skeptical about us, and not sure she believes us.

Taking a short rest, we regain some strength and listen to the fight end. We see prisoners being brought back, but not many [[Eberronian Military]] soldiers either. We tell [[Colvia Ghul]] about the memory, and she's particular concerned about that, calling it false and asking [[Rez]] for a full account. As we tell about [[Teld's Dogs]] we pull out their items. [[Rez]] talks about the sword as a cover ask that we "held bacl", then [[Freya]] asks about [[the Rippers]] but she warns those are ceremonially given to the head of [[Teld's Dogs]], which may very well be disbanded after this, and thinks [[Freya]] might not want them.

[[Colvia Ghul]] asks if she can look through [[My Hole]], seems to specifically locate for objects but doesn't find them. She does spend time on [[G'zraad]]s golden fingers, and the bark with sigils on it from [[Weirefesteria]]. She also notes the warforged bracer [[Hugh|Finn]] stashed. Offering them to [[Hugh|Finn]] as a reward, he states they belonged to his friends. They argue, and he calls her disgusting before leaving. 

[[Costi]] notes that she doesn't mention [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] in the whole later half of our conversation, inclining us to think her focus is her true job - beyond the [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]]. 

After, she thanks us and updates - 224 [[ELA]] casualties and 25 taken hostage. [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] personally defeated [[Devkorus Kaa]], and is bringing back his head. He was hurt quite badly. If we hadn't stopped those bombs from going off, it would've killed him and devastated the rest of their forces. Of the 800 who left, there's only 180 left.

She says she'll put her reports into [[Jezeten]], and will return there some point soon. It's a victory in name only, but there will be a feast in celebration and then march back to the [[Burbank Compound]] arriving in a day or two. However, at the end of it all, it's clear that [[Colvia Ghul]] does not believe us, and hopes "we get what we deserve". Fuck.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] pulls [[Rez]] to the side to tell her that she thinks [[Sinkerk]] hid something on her when he pulled her aside. Makes perfect sense to her because she's so special and trustworthy. In order to find it, she might as we strip so they check every possible spot. Noting that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] starts to get awkward, [[Rez]] really leans into teasing her about it. 

Eventually, they find polished splinter of wood, the [[ELA Ebony Stake]] sharp on one end, like a small stake, a very dark black. Deciding to keep it hidden from the rest of the group, [[Rez]] assures her it will be "their secret".

[[Costi]] checks on the new friends he made, and is glad to know they survived. They were hurt, and also would've been killed if the hospital blew up. 

[[Freya]] asks [[The Curator]] to come chat about a item that would be of interest to her. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends a few times, then spends some time coping with what he saw.

We rest, and the journey back is quite uneventful, and we move quickly. [[Costi]] identifies [[Sinkerk]]'s items. 

[[Ring of Amity]] (A) 
	This silver ring is inscribed with the celestial word for "friend' on the outside and the draconic one on the inside. When you attune this ring, you touch a creature to band. Whenever you are subject to a spell or magic effect that restores HP, that creature receives the same benefits. Can change creatures after a long rest. Bond ends if creature leaves plane, or as bonus action. Additionally, once per day, when creature hits with as attack roll while you are within 60 ft, you can use your reaction to make the hit a crit.

[[Shadowform Shield]] (A) 
	+1 Shield, emblazoned with a black sun and rimmed with twelve sharp points. As a bonus action, its wielder can make on attack, adding their attack modifier, dealing 2d6+4 slashing, plus 1d8 necrotic. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw or be knocked prone. Undead are immune to this attack. Last, once daily this shield's wielder can use it to become shadow for 10 minutes. In this form, a creature has a fly speed of 100 ft and con pass through spaces larger than a keyhole.

Notably, no one sees [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], and [[Fingers]] hints it's more his pride than his body.
