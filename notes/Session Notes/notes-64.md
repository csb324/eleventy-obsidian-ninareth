# Detailed Notes: Session 64

We wake up and talk to [[Giary]], he says he's been very successful in the [[Fishermen]] fighting pits - he gives [[Jade]] his winnings -- a pound of 'Nips'. It is a very illegal amount to have. We make an extended bit about [[my hole]].

We recap meeting [[Figs]] to see if it's okay to talk about [[Giary]]'s work, and [[Costi]] offers to help him learn what it feels like to breath under water - and turns him into a clownfish. It works prefectly, and now it's safe for us to talk without giving away any secrets. [[Giary]] is loving his work, they stole a boat filled with blubber. We take a moment to think about the flammability... it's not a great sign but [[Giary]] doesn't necessarily think they sold it to the [[Fire Raisers]].

[[Giary]]'s in a band now, he's a talented percussions compared to people here. We workshop some names, it's between Hitting Things, Details, and Black Eyes, Please. He's staying at an inn called [[Fug Luggers]] which is a [[Fishermen]] hideout (ask for 10 whiskey shots to go to the FIghting Rings). They are for sure working with the [[Fire Raisers]], including doing some jobs. The [[Fishermen]] are working with the Unions to smuggle weapons into [[Arkhosia (City)]], but think it's most of them, though maybe not the Gold Union. He thinks they have a job upcoming to break into the [[Admirials Office]], he'll try to join to learn more about the [[Cloud's Lament]]. [[Giary]] says if we need to make some money we can join into the fighting ring. We might've found our way to fund our trip to the [[Halls of the Dead]]. We ask what's the most he's heard of someone earning, and he warns us of "Belka the Unblooded". [[Rez]] asks if he's picked up any names of [[Fire Raisers]], sweet dumb boy has not, but says he'll try to find out. We plan to meet [[Giary]] there to fight tomorrow night.

[[Jade]] and [[Figs]] talk about life in [[Thalfar]] for a minute, then we all break. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Winifey]], "How dare I not send you myself? Rob you of the chance to hear my voice? A crime! Drinks? Free tonight, maybe after group dinner?", she replies: "Ah, better. That sounds delightful - how about the [[Silver Pike]]? 8, tonight? Might have to talk some business. I'll assume that works"

We talk about needing to get [[Freya]] and [[Hugh]] on a date. [[Freya]] says she's still to scarred from her broken engagement. [[Hugh]] says he'd like a date and we try to figure out who [[Hugh]] is into. [[Freya]] asks him to rank us all and [[Giary]], but [[Costi]] alters to look a different kind of man. For pure looks, from worst to best: [[Giary]], [[Freya]], [[Jade]], [[Costi]], then [[Rez]]. She gloats. [[Costi]] starts changing himself to different iterations to see what [[Hugh]] likes best. 

We decide to be very publically about town, first going to the [[Temple of the Setting Sun]] for [[Hugh]] then the [[First Temple of Bahamut]] for [[Rez]]. A roughly hewn stone building juts out of the top of the cliff, and as the sun comes up it catches on ridges of outcropping - splaying colors that move with the path of the sun. And boy those stairs really fuck [[Rez]] up, she arrives exhausted. [[Hugh]] starts to look around, there are many many practioners here along with both preachers and guards. 

It looks like it sub-divides into different Gods. [[Costi]] follows the halflings into [[Shrine to Yondala]], there's a path built particularly for larger people called the "[[Stalwart Mudd]] Way". They're clearly having a party, with just tables of food around. [[Hugh]] follows the dwarves towards the sound of hammer on stone and metal. A dwarf named [[Mewtur]] stops him and asks if he's with [[TrueSilver]]. There's a [[Supply Closet Hearth|very small unused Hearth]] inside, but assumes he'll enjoy re-making the area into a home. [[Jade]], [[Freya]], and a slightly unwilling [[Rez]] follow the elves into a transitioned wood-grown section of the Temple. Leaves grow overhead, and some of the music is harp music. There's baby blue flowers that almost seem to honor the [[Larethian Rose]]. [[Rez]] grabs her necklace and tells [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] we haven't forgotten her. [[Freya]] share some of her concerns with a tree, it laments with her but doesn't really understand. 

As [[Rez]] tries to stand, she bumps into some sort of invisible force. She holds her copper coin and says, "do you miss her too?". Someone replies!! "There are too many eyes here, we should speak elsewhere." She offers the park they know, and the invisible voice says they'll follow. 

As [[Hugh]] leaves, the hearth flares blue but does not burn him. [[Costi]] is full toasty, they've been pouring drinks down. They also cure [[Rez]]'s exhuastion.

We start to leave and [[Hugh]] suggests the Hearth which seems like the right place for a quiet conversation. A person pops into existence, man removes a ring, very mild. We see an older elf, slightly beyond middle-age, balding with shorter dark brown hair, appears like quite a regular person but in leather armor. He's got the holy symbol of [[Corellon Larethian]] around his neck. 

His name is [[Willow]], he's familiar with us. He's known [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] since she was quite small, but she wouldn't know him. He thinks she's very important. He asks if we're familiar with the term Oracle, someone with a direct tie to a god. He says some come to pass and some don't , but he had a vision about music - a particular song played a particular way - and shortly later he heard it. It was  [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] playing. He's noticed little bit of his favor around her, but he thinks something is majorly wrong with the world. [[Hugh]] casts Zone of Truth, and he agrees as long he doesn't have to talk about the nightmares. He says he's helped her all along, he arranged a scholarship for her. He says he has influence among the [[Church of Corellon Larethian]], and they needed to push her along the right path. After she started working for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]].  He says he got a job with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] as a guard, he says he gave her the dagger with a message of another way. He said [[Henrik]] was nicer than most, and could be kinder. However, he couldn't see [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s face at all, it's just dark. He could "keep an eye on her" through the knife, and making sure she stayed on the "right path". He says he hasn't heard her music in a few weeks, and the dreams have been worse.

[[Rez]] asked if [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is the right path, and he says he's unsure. He doesn't know us, but he says he cares for her. [[Rez]] starts to say her concern that he's seems to 'guide' her a lot, and worried that he'll lead her away from us. As he's considering, [[Hugh]] recreates secretly some of the music and when [[Willow]] asks if we hear it too - [[Rez]] says "hear what", as [[Costi]] tweaks the sound for him to believe her deception. He says he gets a pull sometimes, but very rarely full visions. He's currently being pulled toward [[Quaath]]. He thinks we need to go there, and bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp. 

[[Jade]] asks if he's heard that his inside is spicy, he asks if she's flirting with him - and it seems like that's a maybe all around. 

[[Hugh]] asked if he can help us [[Resurrect Adrienne]], and he says he knows how important it to bring her back. He says every time he looks at a calendar it flashes to the month Hulfni (which is three months way) and the Miirkikear (Day of the Songs) in that month. He thinks if we go there then, and play a song on the harp, he'll have a fit that shows us how to bring back [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. 

He thinks it's key to saving the world, but he can't say anything about it without starting to choke on his tongue. Any way he's tried to get the memories out has almost killed him. [[Costi]] shares his vision of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and it seems to be shockingly simialr. He thinks there's something wrong with everything, and he thinks she might be part of stopping it. #mysteries 

They've talked to a few other religious orders, but only the losers and none of the well-established ones. We ask about getting to [[Quaath]], he says several months by foot but only a few days stowing away on ships. 

We talk about who would play the harp, and [[Costi]] tries to borrow knowledge from [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], but gets some gorgeous ethereal woman instead. It works though. 

[[Willow]] seems to assume we have a plan, and says we can always know where we are - he usually checks it's location every few hours. [[Rez]] asks if we can't talk to him, who else with [[Church of Corellon Larethian]] should we talk to? [[No-Karo]] is another oracle he trusts, they change their appearance regularly, but last they were human middle-aged with a pink mohawk, living in [[Cerandan]], they're an oracle of [[Pelor]].

He gives us 40 platinum, and says money is no object to him, he doesn't know where it comes from. 

He says people are after him, one has a face writhed in flames with horns, he's 14ft tall, [[Costi]] thinks it sounds like a pit fiend, he watches him from the sky. Another is a younger human man, with curly brown hair and dark skin, in his 20's, with feathery wings he doesn't use who watches from the same. The last is an un-dead looking creature with mostly bone, sunken eyes with something there in both who watches from below. #mysteries 

[[Costi]] goes to make use of his limited harp-playing ability, and does an impressive but fine job before he loses it. We make our way out of the [[Temple of the Setting Sun]]
