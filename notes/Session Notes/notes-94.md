# Detailed Notes: Session 94

When we awake, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sends to [[Henrik]] to ask about [[Sienna Burbank]] and [[Cliff Burbank]]. 

We begin our day by selling our monster parts, at the [[the Apothecaria]], run by a dark-skinned human named [[Mr. Kadz]] - we get a good deal there. We also trade 4 Potion of Darkvision for 2 Potion of Necrotic Resistance. We also get healing potions - 2 greater and a superior. He seems interested in forming a partnership, but requires a 10,000GP spending limit before showing his finer wares. We strike a deal to bring him magical monster parts as part of that deal. We could also invest in R&D for a partial count. [[Rez]] shows him the [[diamond goo]] we used to de-petrify [[Costi]]. He says the remnants we have were probably 800gp worth of diamonds, if we leave 2,000gp with him he could experiment on a bigger version over the next 6 months. We decide to think about it. 

[[Freya]] goes to the [[Quaath Wayfinder Outpost]], where she revels in her newfound celebrity status.

Back at the [[Marble Dome]], [[The Silver Halves]] are waiting for us. They're going to head out of town early ([[Vask]] is wanted in the [[Copper Circle]] for a "fight" with 6 people last night). They're stopping by [[Zalev]], and then will see us in [[Eberron]]. [[Costi]] uses his new [[pocketwatch]] to check out the olives [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] ate at the [[Duvey Crypt]]. Time seems to stop when he investigates them. [[Magister]] agrees they're affected by chronomancy. We share that we did get an appointment to see them tomorrow. We agree to try and hide anything we took from those vaults before our meeting in case they have magical tracers or the like. [[Magister]] warns us against eating any other random magical foods if we don't know what they do in the future. 

As they leave, he also checks-in with [[Hugh]]. He shares his apprehension in trusting the [[Burbanks]]. [[Magister]] says [[Cliff Burbank]] is not like many in [[Eberron]], but [[Hugh]] maintains even if he was far from the battlefields he was sanctioning the memory wipes. They both are curious about his intentions. [[Magister]] gifts him a small blue vial to help him dream - if he lets him know in advance they can talk. They both wish each other safety.

[[Vask]] and [[Rez]] say goodbye, he asks about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] - [[Rez]] tries to understand why he needed to target her, he says she was rude to him. At least he didn't do something worse. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] talks about our plans for [[Eberron]]. [[Hugh]] wants to learn more about his memory, and potentially is interested in them restoring his memory, depending on what they say. We know that [[Cliff Burbank]] should be familiar with [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] but not sure how recent their interactions were. We want to discuss the [[Beating Heart Battalion]]. We assume [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] will want to talk about [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. We can also try to learn about [[Von]].

[[Costi]] goes to hunt any cool spell scrolls - he's recommended [[Golden Books]], where we meet a silver dragonborn who runs the shop. He gets a scroll of feather fall and absorb elements. He gets some dizzit from the front desk at the [[Marble Dome]] as well.

The next day we talk about how we want to approach with [[Duvey Family]], and [[Costi]] practices uses arcane eye before our expedition. 

We decide to go to the temples outside of town first, heading by way of the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Quaath]]. We run into the same guard that welcomed us into the city, [[Silver Scale Jazat]]. 

We go to the [[Temple of Corellon Outside Quaath]], [[Figs]] and ask her to keep it quiet that we were successful [[Resurrect Adrienne]]. [[Willow]] left shortly after we did, he had to go "see a horse about a man". He said we'd see him again soon, "34 days", from the day he left. We tell her super loosely about helping the gods, ask about her relationship with the [[The Boundless Grove|Boundless Grove]] and she says we're always welcome. 

[[Hugh]] stops by the small [[Temple to Moradin outside Quaath]] and pays his respects. 

We re-enter the city and are greeted by [[Silver Scale Jazat]], he asks if we need a guard - we decline, but [[Rez]] says there might some excitement in the [[Copper Circle]], that [[Vask]] left the city but might've left an impression. We head toward the [[Duvey Family]] shop.

A gnome lets us is with our designated passcode "Jade earrings and a sapphire bracelet", and are lead into a long lobby then a small enclosed room. He immediately notices the arcane eye, and gives us an out to be blameless - we take it, he dispels it. We travel down at least 100 feet, and arrive in a well lit larger showroom. There's a large family portrait on the wall, we quickly recognize [[Winifey]], and try to match faces to the names and descriptions we've been given. While we wait, they bring us personalized drinks: oil for [[Hugh]], lindith for [[Freya]], [[Goodbarrels]] ale for [[Costi]], and extremely fine wine for [[Rez]]. [[Costi]] tries to detect if it's [[3434]] vintage, but can't quite tell. 

[[Baldred Duvey]] enters and welcomes us in, and answers [[Costi]]'s question about vintage on the beer - it's 2140. She clearly knows [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] and said she was surprised not to see us at [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]'s ball. She says it's a shame [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] couldn't be here, and gave us a deep blue liquor. [[Costi]] calls out that it's not widely known, and she shares that information is her value.

She says the [[Several's Antiquities]] sell for the adventurer, but they seem focused on the home. We give her a sampling of our items: [[Ring of Telekinesis]], [[The Healing Brand]], [[Cube of Force]], Githyanki Silver Greatsword (3,300 GP - a perfectly fair bid), and an [[Ivory Pistol]] (500 GP, an absurd price) - she's interested in buying them all, and wants to keep the pistol for herself. She asks if we plan to remain within high society - they have fine gala clothes that confer AC benefit. She shows us a [[Ring of Temporal Salvation]], if one were to die it would reverse that, with a bit more health (3d6+con) and a better space (within 5ft), and reduces your levels of exhaustion by 1. It can bring back one person every 30 days (9371)

As we talk, a sensor appears above [[Costi]] that he can see with his detect invisibility. It's so close to [[Baldred Duvey]], and appears she's being targeted. He tells her she's being spied on, and activates ghostly gaze - there's no one in the neighboring offices, but there is a secret passage near her window. 

After our sale, she wants to gossip a bit - asks about [[Victoria Several]], and alludes to [[Vask]]'s crush. She says they left the North in disgrace after the [[The Second Sundering]] after the true nature of their patriarch came out - [[Dante Several]], sold his soul to [[Valcano]]. The [[Intrepid Zumbini]]'s put him down, and the news came out it ruined them. The last 80-100 years has seen them rise up to new money in [[Quaath]]. We ask about [[Valcano]], she says he was the only villain not brought to justice - he was involved with all sorts of sordid things like bring back [[Tiamat]], zombies, and skeletons. She says she's not that adventurous, prefers to be at home. 

We discuss future partnership - they want things that look good on a wall, or doors, particularly those with history or enchantment. We ask for any other gossip, [[Vask]] got into a pissing contest with [[Jendorp Duvey]]. She asks us about [[Winifey|Winnie]], we say we met her in [[Jalantar]], where she had been involved with the [[Fire Raisers]]. We say we assumed, in all that went down, she's probably not still around. We say if we'll hear anything more with her. It seems to go over fine.

Two others greet us as we leave, [[Carlot Duvey]] in a fine dress with shoulder length gray hair and decorative braids, and a young man who looks similar to [[Baldred Duvey|Baldred]] with short dark hair and a square jaw, [[Jendorp Duvey]]. He greets [[Rez]] and shares his appreciation of [[Vask]] and passes a note to her "If you're interested in a drink, I'll be at the Dome tonight. Come to the bar". She passes her regards to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and we thank them for their discretion - [[Carlot Duvey]] says hopefully [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] doesn't ask her outright about it. We agree it should be a useful partnership. [[Baldred Duvey|Baldred]] warns [[Rez]] about [[Jendorp Duvey]], and asks us to give [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] a kiss from her.

As we walk back, [[Freya]] is jumped from an alley, as a gruung jams a knife into her side. It's the [[Gruung Slayers]]. We killed most of them, but the rogue tore off [[Freya]] Gruung Cloak and ran away. There's nothing on their bodies other than badges that show a blue firbolg with it's eyes crossed out and their names. 

After a brief wait, guards come and find us - we file a complaint, and with a threat from [[Costi]] to take our money elsewhere, they agree to comp the rest of our stay. They have no idea how much they needed it. We also plan to go to the [[Silver Circle]] tomorrow and selling some of our lower caliber items and monster parts.

Chatting, we agree [[Rez]] should go meet [[Jendorp Duvey]] for drinks. Asks to tell [[Vask]] "He'll have his" - he should know what that means. He asks Rez what she'll drink. Rez lets him order. Jendorp asks the bartender, Kurt, for a drink that is a family recipe. Apparently Kurt is a friend of the family. Jendorp is not in town often and doesn't spend much time in the gold circle. He has a small fleet of 3 airships and 15 transport ships. He prefers the sea over the sky. Kestin does more airshiping. He and Kestin are the primary people who get items for the family. They also freelance in addition to retrieving items for the family. "I do not envy Baldred.. her time behind the desk." The drink comes, and it's a smoked drink. It must sit for 7 minutes or it is ruined. "Why have something that is not the best." Rez brings up [[Arkhosia]]. Jen asks, "is it true [[Winifey]] is dead?... No one has heard of her in 4 years."  Kestin apparently also disappears, but he sends notes. Uncle [[Albus Duvey]]'s daughter. Jendorp never cared for Winifey much, "some family is dead weight." Jendorp thinks it was mutual. Jen has been trying to get the uncle cut off for 31 of his 33 years. Jen brings up the gambling, drinking, bastard children, etc... "we could just let him drown." Jen is "as close as anyone is to [[Carlot Duvey]]." "I think Carlot might be immortal." Insight yields (13):
- Arrogant
- Interested in meeting Rez, unclear *why*
	- turns out it's just horniness

The drink is delightful and from the tropics. Pineapple. Jen asks for any leads on items. Rez mentions the tapestry. Jen has heard rumors of where we're going next and mentions [[Sienna Burbank]]. Mutual family friends, Sienna might be doing supper with mother. It was a "guess" that Sienna was connected. He mentions that "the little one" (Costi) is from Eberron. Doesn't like Eberron. "That many rotting corpses.. it permeates the air." Asks why Ebberon. Rez says they're friends. "The tie is no longer with you" he says loudly, "such a shame that Adrienne passed." He's clearly trying to show that he is happy to help keep the secret. Re why he slipped a note in Rez's pocket. "If Vask's sister is anything like Vask..." Insight check (18) yields from Joe, "Vask is cool and this one's a lady." Poor Rez. Second insight w/ adv on whether there is info to be gained, he's a little insufferable being so rich but he just wanted to go on a date. No info probably from this encounter. They fuck. BUT NOT BEFORE DRUNKENLY SHOOTING GUNS INTO THE NIGHT. He's gone when she wakes up, but leaves a note, "You were right, much the preferred sibling"

In the night, [[Costi]] gets a message from [[Sienna Burbank]] telling him to be ready around 3pm.

At breakfast, [[Hugh]] receives a note with his meal and very sketchily says he needs to go to the bathroom. Heading outside, an older gnome hugs his leg and says "29? Is it really you?", when [[Hugh]] seems confused, he says he lost his memories. The gnome quickly apologizes and leaves. He returns to tell us, "it's your [[Charky]]?" [[Rez]] messages him to say that [[Hugh]] thinks he knows him, but despite his memory loss we're trying to help restore his memories for him. He agrees to come talk if we order room service. 

[[Charkus Duvram]] served with [[Hugh]] in [[Eberronian Military]], but he's been in [[Quaath]] for 65 years. [[Rez]] asks if he'd write down some of his memories for [[Hugh]] to read when it's safe, he says he'll leave it by the door. They grew close, and when [[Charkus]] declined an order (also disliking violence), [[Hugh]] busted him out and let him get away. We ask if there's anyone else he can remember from their service, [[Githoros]] was someone they served under - he directed their battalion (the 18th) and was cruel. He's from [[Jezeten]], but doesn't want his family to know he's alive. We tell him a bit about who he is now, and [[Charkus]] gives him a thimble. [[Costi]] thinks it seems like they were perhaps lovers, but it's hard to tell [[Hugh]] any update.

[[Freya]] briefly questions [[Guu]] about his involvement with the [[Gruung]], and he's offended. In recompense, [[Freya]] gets him on drills strengthening his hands to learn to use weapons. 

We go to the [[Silver Circle]], and sell a whole bunch of weapons, and get 4,800 GP. It's a big help. 

[[Hugh]] sendings to [[Sienna Burbank]] about where we should meet. She plans to meet us at the [[Marble Dome]]. She arrives and talks briefly about the people she has to meet, she says [[Carlot Duvey]] is part of a group of women she came up with - they all get together when she's back in town. Their airship is named [[Keepsake]]. 

We get introduced to the bagman [[Private Hageth]], who was transferred from [[New Fairhaven]] after losing 86 horses. Now he grows turnips, and seems pretty pleased with his lot in life. The other soldiers say he's the bosses pet, and can't even grow the turnips, [[Cliff Burbank]] is allergic. We learn they have a lot of warforged on the compound, but they take their identities very seriously. 

We're greeted again by [[Sienna Burbank]] and we lift off on our way to [[Eberron]].
