# Detailed Notes: Session 88

[[Rhynilex Svenik]] interrogates them, in undercommon through [[Jade]], to the rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] chagrin's, [[Durembur]] says they're here for a shared problem. She wants them to give their weapons to [[Freya]] so we can go to [[Izdeke]] and have them be interrogated by [[The Matron]]. We convince them to cooperate, and they seem to decide to play along. 

[[Rez]] messages to [[Durembur]] that they are actually trustworthy but to keep their touch close, and she says that [[Rieltar]] know. We all get on the road together.

When we arrive [[Rhynilex Svenik]] arranges for them to speak to [[The Matron]] after a brief hold in a cell, we'll be able to talk to them after she determines they're trustworthy. We request that if they decide to kill them, we at least get to talk to them first. They consider it. 

We rest for about two hour, [[Jade]], [[Costi]], and [[Freya]] look at [[Kith and Kin]]. [[Hugh]] begins knitting [[Costi]] a beret.

[[Rhynilex Svenik]], [[Durembur]], and [[Rieltar]] come to speak to us. [[Nekto Brahnsen]] has to spend the night in prison for his assault on [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]]. [[Durembur]] also speaks undercommon and has been to the [[underdark]] before. [[Durembur]] says she'll prepare to speak to the [[Bahamat]] dead paladins tomorrow. 

We agree to swap prophecies, [[Rez]] dramatically reads our version "below the depths, roots of oldest anchor, aching, leaking, empty, bled for power" then later "the four touches together, patch, mend the tear, and set things right, anew no worse for wear" "when time is right, worlds align, veils are thin, strings will sing, and what will rise fights again".

The [[The Burning Sons]] version is pretty similar, "below the depths, roots of oldest anchor, aching, leaking, empty, bled for power. Lores touches together, patch, mend the tear, and set sun's light anew no worse for wear. When time is right, worlds assigned, veils are thin, the sun shall shine, and those died fight again"

They're also here to revive someone [[Riveika]], who used to be part of their band. We share that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was [[Corellon Larethian]]'s choice. Because we're [[Corellon Larethian]]'s territory, they were also specifically told to aim for Songs Day. They heard there's from [[No-Karo]]. They light up brightly, was hard to understand, and then a portal opened up. They came from [[Cerendon]]. [[No-Karo]] reached out to them, they didn't ask a lot of questions but did believe they knew [[Riveika]]. 

[[Hugh]] thinks about if the Dwarven group is from [[Moradin]] what would be his touch - thinks maybe a metal ingot, or a mobile small tool. We share the rest of what we know, and they agree either [[Moradin]] and [[Yondala]] makes sense. They note they've also fought strengthened creatures, including some who seemed to have [[dunamancy]] enhancements. [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]! 

We ask them about [[The Silver Hand]], and they know of it as a historical crime syndicate. We also learn that [[Skiv]] is a former [[Wayfinders]], out of [[Thelran Asari]]. They've traveled a lot, and before we learn more they ask if we can catch up more over breakfast. 

[[Costi]] goes to 'spar' with [[Rhynilex Svenik]] - [[Hugh]] asks if he needs help. He's good lol. They do legitimately spar, and [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] knocks him unconscious but wakes him up and tells him to try better tomorrow.  

We wake up, decide on our plan today (breakfast, fixing [[Freya]]'s head, buying more darkvision potions, then searching for the Dwarven party). 

[[The Burning Sons]] went to talk to the [[Bahamat]] paladins, they were also looking to bring someone back, a [[Golpherox]]. We decide to both look through the surrounding area of tunnels, them searching for followers of [[Yondala]] and us for [[Moradin]]. We'll overlap to cover the same area in our searches. We learn [[Felnyra Svenik]], [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]]'s younger sister.  

We cover a bit of mutual background, and [[Freya]] talks about her work with the [[Wayfinders]] with [[Skiv]]. She knew [[Rawley]], who she thinks is a good man, [[Akros]], and [[Naya]] - she also went to the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]] but hated it because of how much internal politics there was. She recognizes [[Freya]] as from [[Polaris]], she went with [[Rawley]] about 15 years ago. [[Costi]] casts detect thoughts to try and learn more about what [[Skiv]] knows about [[Polaris]]. He sees a lot of the landscape and some scenes with [[Rawley]], but nothing of particular note. He then asks if she's still in contact, and [[Skiv]] says that it's been years - didn't take kindly to her leaving the [[Wayfinders]]. He sees a conversation with a halfling in a fine dining room looking out over a towering city, but he hears yelling. He feels her hit him, and as it fades a flicker of another memory - a piece of paper address to [[Skiv]]. The words are blurry, but he can read the last passage, "I'm sorry, don't contact me again. [[Rawley]]"

Before we leave, [[The Burning Sons]] ask us to make a pact that none of us take on the Ilithid alone and to retreat until both groups are there. He thinks if we do it early it might affect the anchor tree, if he's managing the void. 

We check their vibe before we head out, it's clear [[Rieltar]] is their leader from an earned respect, [[Durembur]] is very close with him, and in a romantic relationship with [[Nekto]]. [[Skiv]] is in some ways more separate from the rest of them. 

[[Nekto]] gives [[Freya]] +1 lockpicks when she asks him for a skeleton key. He explains that he met [[The Burning Sons]] by trying to pickpocket from [[Durembur]]. She didn't turn him in, and after 5 attempts he realized he liked them and joined up. 

[[Freya]] goes to get her brain fixed, and when the skin grows back over her skull it is different - a harder shell, with someone spiky texture, and more yellowish coloration than her normal coloring. She doesn't recognize it as familiar to any type of creature. [[Costi]] looks at it magically, he's never seen anything like but it looks like the tail she sometimes grows. It seems similar to a scorpion. [[Jade]]'s glasses flash ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]) and she pulls out a card - she pulls out one referencing the [[Mirror Planes]]. 

We discuss our dwarf detection plan, then head into the tunnels. [[Hugh]] enhances [[Freya]]'s tracking and she's able to follow the footsteps they found of the dwarves for about an hour. As the spells ends, [[Hugh]] doesn't detect any mountain dwarves. [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] and [[Freya]] help us from getting turned around, we backtrack a bit to continue our search. We interspace locate object on Moradin's Touch, but nothing pings. After some time walking, [[Hugh]] feels a ping about 1,000 ft down a mountain dwarf. He tries to convey that to [[Freya]] on a map where they are, and she is naturally able to spot them. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Rieltar]], "We think we found them! Mountain dwarf, 1000 feet down. We're 20 minutes away we think, heading there now. Where are you guys?". He replies, "Excellent work! Hard to say without a map, along the route previously discussed. Will try dwarves, maybe join. Good luck"

We tell [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] that we should enter first so they don't attack her, when she asks if we plot betrayal and want to kill her and [[Izdeke]], [[Rez]] says she can count that [[Costi]] doesn't want to kill her because he wants to kiss. She blushes, and drops the topic. 

Heading down, as we get close we start to notice fortifications that seem slapdash and recent. There's some blood and bodies of creatures. [[Rez]] messages in to tell them that we're here to help [[Heal the Anchor Tree]], and that we're with a drow. They seem super relieved and go to get someone, but our guards are up. There's some duregar corpses, and they all seem to have brains. We hear some noise, and they spring a trap. Right before, [[Hugh]] notices their symbols of [[Moradin]] and says he's here with [[TrueSilver]].

They attack us, as we repeatedly try to de-escalate. They apologize and say it's not personal, but continue attacking. [[Costi]] reads one of their minds after [[Hugh]] calms them, and he sees a metal ingot and 3 empty spaces pulsing hungrily. We struggle to contain them, and increasingly move towards we have to fight. [[Hugh]] tries to beseech [[TrueSilver]] to ask why [[Moradin]] is acting at odds to us, he doesn't feel that our purposes are at odds, we seem to have the same goal until our purposes diverge. It doesn't help us be less confused.

[[Costi]] delves deeper into his detect thoughts, he sees an image that is similar to [[Hugh]]'s visions - an aching wound in a tree, it closes over. He sees a face, a smiling dwarvish face, sitting beside him and the others in their group. He feels anguish as he sees his group. 

[[Hugh]] pulls away from the cleric casting heat metal on him, saying "If [[Moradin]] could not burn me, you certainly cannot", and ends his concentration on the spell.

[[Jade]] and [[Freya]] grab the [[Moradin's Touch]], [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] search the rest of them, we get 5 greater healing potions. We also find, a magical longsword, maul, boots, maul, ring, ring, cloak, knife, sword, shield, flute. We also find dog tags that all say [[Temper Metal]], each with an instrument. 

As we breathe after the conflict, [[Costi]] tells us his vision and his theory that only one person can be brought back. We also look around the camp, there's tucked away cots and bedrolls - underneath one of the beds we find their version of the prophecy: 

"Below the depths, roots of oldest anchor. aching leaking empty bled for power. Four touches together, patch, mend the tear, and set things right, anew no worse for wear. When time is right, wills align, nails and tin, metal tempered, those that died fight again."

We burn the bodies, to keep them from turning into zombies, revealing any potential secrets, and in honor of [[Moradin]]'s burial rights - per [[Hugh]]'s request. 

[[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhynilex]] offers a safe house in the tunnels for us tonight, and after a quick question on whether we trust the [[The Burning Sons]], we decide they're better with us either way. She then sendings to her sister [[Felnyra Svenik]]. 

We barely make it into a hidey hole, and discuss what we should tell [[The Burning Sons]]. We're concerned that we're interpreting things wrong, [[Costi]] thinks back on his detect thoughts, and we're certain that there's no more information other than the [[Moradin]] party thought that killing us was the right path forward. 

[[The Burning Sons]] arrive in our
