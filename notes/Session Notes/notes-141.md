# Detailed Notes: Session 141

We send [[Costi]]'s arcane eye to try and scout out the [[Zhakastin Expedition]]. We decide have [[Hugh|Finn]] use another eye as well. 

Costi Eye - 55
	 This eye travels down the northern most hallway, shortly finding a small room with metal grates throughout the space, with a red glow bubbling up from them. It's clear something tore through this room. There a bodies, many badly burnt. It seems like they've had chests caved in, not much slashing damage, some were engulfed in flame, but most of the others seem to have discrete burns from individual. 
	 There first store room is completely caved in. Not able to see anything, he has to hug the wall to check for cave ins and if he sees anything he does. The second store room has also caved in. 
	 The third has some strange stone but is possible to get in. Inside, there is a small amount of light from glass orbs that have been installed. There are crates inside, and some other unlabeled boxes. 
	 He makes his way to the mining chamber, the cart path seems like it heads downward but is not immediately seen to be caved in. 
Finn Eye - 51
	Down the shipping lane, can see a number of small mining carts that unload from a number of large train cars. Glass, Coal, Sapphire, and then boxes numbered in a pattern 1234567-12345. There are many overturned, traveling through this tunnel would be very difficult. There are blue draconic bodies lying all around. It looks like this tunnel would take over 20 minutes to walk through. It seems like the cars and carts were purposefully placed this way to funnel movement through certain pathways, with some smokey ephemeral creature hiding. The chokepoint would make groups walk in a single file line. Walking back, he looks closer at the bodies to notice that none of them appear to be warriors. 
	The southernmost tunnel is completely caved in. 
	Recovering ground, he heads through the shipping lane again and into the trap. Climbing up a hill of debris. Two tunnels are in this mountain. There are 10 draconic skeletons, 8 with crossbows and 2 heavily armored at the end of each forced tunnels through the wreckage. In each ambush area, there are smokey ox creatures. 
	Arriving to the mining chamber the ceiling rises 80 feet, the floor plunges 100 feet, and there's stone paths around the edge of the room, about 25 feet across, corkscrewing both up and down. He cannot see to the other side, despite a small amount of illumination from the glass within the walls. 
	Making his way to the guard outpost, he sees a blue draconic corpse in 37 of the 50 cots. There's a table of four draconic skeletons frozen in a moment of casual hanging out, with one standing beside them. The food on the table looks like it is decaying as expected, but the draconic creature with it's head on it's hand seems to subtly readjust - it seems like they're faking being frozen. 

[[Bek]] tells us there's other elementals working in the [[Zhakastin Expedition]], but not necessarily magma earth elementals. He also says the smokey ox creatures are called Raeki from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] and use to be labor animals that ate stone.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] heads into the [[Zhakastin Expedition]], [[Freya]] and [[Rez]] taking potions of darkvision and [[Costi]] looking through [[Samuel]]'s eyes. We do a bad job stealthing. 

As we approach the smelter, we feel an oppressive heat. [[Rez]] creates an ice formation on the bottom to cool the magma, building a chute through the center for all of us to try and slide quickly through the room. [[Rez]], [[Freya]], and [[Costi]] clear the room quickly, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] slides and hits a buzz saw and gets stuck. [[Hugh|Finn]] stops near the edge of the room. Suddenly, there's fire! And Knives! And elementals.

We try our best to survive and flee - making SO MUCH NOISE as we do. 

Reaching the series of storerooms, we find the first two caved in and the last is open - we scrounge around. [[Freya]] detects magic and notices some of the boxes of materials have smaller boxes within them. 3 have potions of lightning resistance. [[Freya]] also breaks a hidden bomb and more expensive potion, a [[potion of maximum power]]. [[Costi]] turns on ghostly gaze, and finds a false wall - inside are more expensive stone boxes. They're all a little trapped, in the same way. It would effect the inside, altering it. Inside are extremely beautiful, extremely well made weapons of various styles. They all bear a master-smiths, which would have been removed if opened incorrectly - a G turning into a T which turns into a hammer. [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Rez]] think it looks giant in make. They're all +1 and have a faint magic essence - we're not sure what they do. We get as many stuffed into [[My Hole]] as we can, which ends up being 200. We destroy the rest. 

As we discuss what to do with the potions, a ghost pops up and tries to posses [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], in a super lazy manner. Shocked, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], says "excuse me", and her, [[Costi]], and [[Rez]] all miss terribly. 

We leave the room, and enter the Glass Mining Chamber.
