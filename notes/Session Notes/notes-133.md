# Detailed Notes: Session 133

We arrive back at [[The Compass Point]], with a note waiting from [[Marius A]], he pushes back our drinks for 3 days from now. 

[[Costi]] says he'd like to go see his [[AVAD]] magepong coach tomorrow, [[Professor Vried Anglesmet]]. A gnome, prone to sweater vests, and a real sweetie. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] tries to scry on [[Rughork]], it doesn't work. He then tries [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]], who resists for a minute then, he sees him sitting alone by a fire, but [[Hugh|Finn]] recognizes the landscape - he's in the [[Luthei Region]], he's not in uniform, and seems to be traveling alone.  

[[Costi]] reads [[Kith and Kin]]. We decide to try and stall out our drinks with [[Colvia Ghul]], [[Hugh|Finn]] asks to give an opportunity to someone in training. "We have settled in and are looking forward to drinks, please let us know several times that work. See you soon we hope!" He's hopeless but [[Hugh|Finn]] believes everyone should have a chance.

[[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Coldseeker Chateau]], "Dinner with all of us? tomorrow?", he says, "Tomorrow may be difficult, but can we do the day after". [[Hugh|Finn]] confirms. 

In the morning, [[Hugh|Finn]] sendings to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "Dossier done? Also anything of note in those letters from [[Viliki]] we should look into while here?", she respond, "By tonight! And if you’d like, we’ve had [[Burston Courtev]] under surveillance since, but haven’t spent much energy on it."

We remember that he's in the Commerce District and decide to go investigate. Before, [[Freya]] repeatedly emphasizes that we should blackmail him, which prompts [[Costi]] to try and forge blackmail - it takes a lot of energy, and she catches him in the act. 

We think back about his work with [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]], and it was mostly in the theoretical nature of creating the [[flesh stitched behemoth]]. [[Burston Courtev]]'s address is close to the center of the Commerce District, near a park, and on one of the side streets near a main road. There's a plaque outside saying [[Courtev's Stationary]]. 

An older gnome in a business suit is behind the counter, it's [[Burston Courtev]]. [[Costi]] distracts him with a thorough conversation about parchment for his spellbook, with [[Hugh|Finn]] taking up a lot of visual space. [[Rez]] sneaks off - makes an illusory double of her self so she can invisibly snoop. There's a ledger, a glass display case of pens and quills, a coin box, and a magical aura over the whole thing. 

[[Freya]] then tries to distract him and accidentally comes up with an idea for prestidigitation toilet paper, and he invites her to tea later to discuss. [[Hugh|Finn]] tries to dispel the magic around the counter, [[Costi]] panics and to distract him, flings a firebolt at the enchanted paper - it works! (Both stops fire and distracts him). Phew! [[Hugh|Finn]] then takes over talking about mechanical pens.

As [[Freya]] comes down, she notes the 3rd stair is squeaky. [[Hugh|Finn]] warns [[Rez]] that [[Burston Courtev]] might be on edge. [[Burston Courtev]]'s son went to [[Thelran Asari]], not much interest in paper, and they haven't talked much sense. [[Costi]] bonds with him, with letter scented of loss, and fishes for info on his son. 

[[Rez]] looks through the papers behind the desk, going through the unlocked ones first. In the fourth, she finds a hunk of metal, it's a holy symbol for [[Pelor]]. [[Burston Courtev]] closes for tea, [[Hugh|Finn]] escorting a 'sick' [[Rez]], [[Freya]] and [[Costi]] go out with [[Burston Courtev]].

[[Rez]] breaks into his apartment, it's super tidy. There's a self portrait with his son, bookshelves, a writing desk, and no loose papers she can see. There's two doors leading out. She closes her eyes, careens around, and bumps into the bedroom door. 

There's side tables, a writing desk, and more books, with a chest at the foot of the bed. She looks for a hidden switch and opens up a false bottom. Inside are a number of fliers, advertisements for followers of [[Pelor]]. The next meeting is in three days, in the park of the commerce district. [[Rez]] looks at the portrait on the way out, sees the son's name is [[Liston Courtev]] then invisibly waits by the door to leave. 

At tea, [[Costi]] leans in on making [[Burston Courtev]] feel fatherly to him - it goes well, he's got practice.
