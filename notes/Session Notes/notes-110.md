# Detailed Notes: Session 110

[[Colvia Ghul]], [[Ignatz]], [[Bouzad Rukhol]] arrive at [[Fingers]] encampment, and we watch as they're reunited with [[Jamzik Zodevzo]].

[[Colvia Ghul]] immediately asks if there's anything else we need to add to our report, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] seems to pick up on something and denies any missing details. We're asked to write a report on what happened, for their records. She also invites us to their rites they'll do for [[Bez]] and [[Grizaf]].

They'll work on the plan, and said we can send one member of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] as a representative, we agree it'll be [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. We ask [[Fingers]] if we should go to the rite, but she says [[Colvia Ghul]] is polite to a fault. 

We learn that the warforged can look to spread rumors, and [[Fingers]] digs on some info about [[Freya]]'s times with [[Captain Ligo Krikeav|Ligo]] - but makes it clear she would never. 

We pass time playing poker with [[Fingers]], the dirty cheat. [[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] clean up, but [[Fingers]] finds it delightful. Its clear we're reading each other and she is tracking both how we operate and our perception of her. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] goes to join the military briefing, and [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes to hang out within message distance of the meeting. They try and trick [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] into having a drink in front of [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] but she picks up on it and shoots it before [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] and [[Dispek Dradleston|Dradleston]] join in magically. [[Dispek Dradleston|Dradleston]] reports - dead is approximately 81 soldiers. They believe it to be a coordinated attack rather than happenstance. This means likely the [[ELA]] had advanced notice, they must be extremely careful with where information is shared. It is recommended to do an "integrity review" in each group. It's also noted that the [[ELA]] is much better resourced than believed, either in magical or financial backing. There were 35 monstrosities alone. Several artifacts of arcane strength were found. This calls for more care and new strategy.

At the same time supply lines were attacked, rust monsters went into the weapons cache, and weevils hit the food stores. This must be remedied quickly, if isolated it will only last a week, not a month.

[[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] calls on [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to describe our actions, she flags the half-undead giant and recommends the check the bodies very carefully. She then pivots to the [[Hallucinatory Orb]]. Warning of the [[Eberronian First Division]], she also encourages another integrity review. [[Colvia Ghul]] backs her up, sharing her read of the required magical strength that would be need to create it: time, gold, a team, and dedicated facilities. The fact that it was used in a seemingly unimportant camp, logically shows that they are more resourced than believed for this to be standard. [[Fingers]] connects it to the [[Slavaadi College]], and says she could believe they could be backing the [[ELA]]. [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] gives some secret tasks to [[Colvia Ghul]], who nods in agreement.

[[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] threatens [[Dispek Dradleston|Dradleston]], then asks his recommendation on next steps. He suggests a large group go back to the [[Burbank Compound]] to get supplies, or everyone returns, traveling along the road to reduce risk of attack. He also suggests concentrating the search to [[Golstrava]], waiting for the full force to return to attack, but not sitting still, continuing to search the ravine and marsh, to prevent a flanking, before fully attacking.

[[Fingers]] agrees, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks about numbers and it seems the plan would be to send more than 20% but less than 50%. [[Colvia Ghul]] agrees, but suggests restructuring, and [[Dispek Dradleston|Dradleston]] power grabs but agrees. [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] tells [[Fingers]] to pick her group to lead back to the [[Burbank Compound]]. They note that their integrity review will be completed by tonight. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is then dismissed.

We quietly get an update back from the briefing, and discuss. We agree [[Costi]] will offer privately to [[Dispek Dradleston|Dradleston]] again to help look at the bodies of monstrosities. We also "connect" the school of illusion is located in the [[Dharinov Duchy]], with the [[Eberronian First Division]]. Also note that sending off a contingent is risky, and then message about how to prepare for the review. [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] take some time to help coach [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] in truths in case we are zone of truthed. 

[[Bouzad Rukhol]] gives [[Costi]] an extra ration of beer, and it catches trend. It seems like a thank you for his volunteering to go into the stocks. Meanwhile [[Colvia Ghul]]'s team, is starting the review, mostly in quick one on one conversations. We learn that she's going to leads the ravine search, and we volunteer to stay with her - though [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] will split and instead we'll be accompanied by Corporal [[Thurath]], one of [[Fingers]]'s men. [[Dispek Dradleston|Dradleston]] has been demoted to just the marsh, and [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] will lead the overall strategy. [[Fingers]] is taking 140 men back to the [[Burbank Compound]]. 

[[Costi]] plants some of the information about the illusion school, and gets asked about [[AVAD]], though he doesn't know anyone powerful enough to be noteworthy. We try to fish a bit about [[Colvia Ghul]]'s contacts at the [[The Slavaadi College]], and while she says she knows people, she tasks us with doing our own recon - wanting to see what we do with  the little we've heard, and tell her who we asked, and what we hear. We're instructed to keep the circumstance of the [[Hallucinatory Orb]] secret, but if we find info to connect anyone to the [[ELA]]. 

[[Rez]] wakes up flailing through the air, in blackness, then looks down and is hurtling towards the ground, somewhere in the North above verdant fields, and moments before impact lifts up and soars. There's scales along her body and they zoom through the sky, looking over I see [[Eirian]]. They bicker a bit, then begin to catch up. [[Eirian]] asks where [[Rez]] found [[Ghez Yhutl]], that he's incredible. [[Rez]] takes credit for making him. Turns out, he's saved [[Eirian]]'s life a few times. Once he came up with a quick cover to distract a conversation and prevent trouble. He's also been traveling with her group, as the've follow [[Pleetos Alentas]], their group almost walked into a trap. [[Ghez Yhutl]] found out that he'd skipped town, and went undercover to learn more - faked doing drugs to be on a bender with them, covered it up and prevented them from being attacked, even discredited [[Pleetos Alentas]] during the process! They believe he's gone to [[Durmask]] now. 

[[Eirian]] also spoke to [[Zmaj]], so she's not going to [[Durmask]]. Still has several leads in [[Thelran Asari]], [[Pleetos Alentas]] was well plugged in. She's been working with a [[Wayfinders]] contact, [[Farybar]], (who is not [[F. Arybar]]) too. He's in the [[Towers]], and they made an interesting contact there, a new arrival who's made quite a splash. His name is [[Samson]], an Aasimar, half-deva or planatar, and she didn't know they were still on the prime material. He arrived with his family, and an elephantine named [[Ferdinand]]. They're very skilled, one in fighting and one at being listened to. They're being interviewed at the [[Towers]], but importantly, they knew the name [[Sezathkathon]], which he claims he found on a piece of paper on a perviously unknown island, [[Home]]. It's about a month's travel by sea below the southern islands. They're putting an expedition together by airship to explore it and check his claims. [[Rez]] is suspicious, what if he's connected to [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]]. [[Eirian]] is trying to get a copy of the letter he referenced. She mentions potentially going on the expedition, but wants to keep on [[Pleetos Alentas]] trail - she says she'll ask [[Zmaj]] for his thoughts on who should go. 

[[Eirian]] asks if [[Rez]] has heard from [[Rez's Dad]]? Neither of them have, and they agree it's weird. Every one who can in our family has tried, and she's worried, but [[Rez]] says not to be - it's dad. He'll be fine. 

They plan to catch up to drink, remind each other to be safe, then [[Eirian]] makes [[Rez]] fall to awakening.

In the morning, we notice a decent group of the rank and file soldiers all have a hallowed out thousand yard stare from the interrogation. [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] says they went into the second round of interrogation, and this type of deeper detect thoughts can take alot out of it. We're exempt by [[Cliff Burbank]], as we're 'contractors'. She offers [[Costi]] some drugs as some help to get through - he accepts. We ask about [[Thurath]], she says he was [[Dispek Dradleston|Dradleston]]'s but transfer to [[Fingers]] team 6 months ago due to his "predilection for exacting service".

[[Freya]] notices as [[Colvia Ghul]] is leaving, she's wearing a gold wire along her traps, that wasn't there before. [[Thurath]] comes and joins us, saying he knows the way, we should follow him and not slow him down. We agree. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Costi's mom]], "High alert for moles - future attack on [[Golstrava]], 140 soldiers on road for supplies. Pushing suspicion on first division. Searches continue, monstrosities effective - your work?". She replies, "Not me, but glad to hear plan effective. Will relay and find [[Jezeten]] contacts."

We journey through the woods along the day, not seeing much of note, and as usually struggling to be quiet. Eventually, we reach the beginnings of the Ravines. At their entrance, we find a burnt out building, the size of a small cottage. Using our coin signal, and our harp signal, he asks [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] for their analysis on the building. After we mention a few observations, he tells us to check it out. [[Costi]] sends an arcane eye to do an initial sweep. 

There are broken windows, damaged furniture, and they are immediately drawn to a slightly moving floorboard, in the back corner of the room. He scans to see if there's any holes in the floor, he notices three areas where the planks are actually newer, intentionally crafted to look old and weathered. 

[[Thurath]] pulls [[Rez]] back first, to watch and range with him. But in [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s attempt to keep us together, ends up getting [[Costi]] stuck back too. As [[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] enter into the building, [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] approach as she notices the glint of metal in the sun on the edge of the ravine. Inside the building, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] doesn't seem to notice any traps but they do hear a light thumping. We try to communicate across the distance, [[Rez]] saying she thinks it's a trap, [[Thurath]] tells [[Costi]] to send [[Samuel]] to look up at the glint, while [[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tentatively explore. 

Suddenly, the wood floor breaks and arms reach up to attack. We defeat some undead, and are further attacked by some people hiding along the ridge. We are hurt, and retaliate, and [[Rez]]  charms three of their fighters - finding out they're [[ELA]]. Oops. She immediately tells [[Costi]], but they're stuck in a hard spot. 

He polymorphs [[Thurath]] into a blind mole rat, so he can't hear or see us. Then yells out that we won't kill them and to stop attacking, but he's not persuasive. However, after the rest of us try to stop the combat, a fighter says "Is one of you [[Adrienne Spout]]? Un-fucking-believable, I just met someone who's looking for you".
