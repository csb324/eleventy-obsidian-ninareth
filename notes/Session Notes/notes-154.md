# Detailed Notes: Session 154

We sneak ahead towards where we think the final freed vampires are hiding out. [[Costi]] reminisces some about [[Marius Lupu]], and how he was always even more radical than [[Costi]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] analyzes but doesn't think either [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] or [[Jehneim Bastienev]] intentionally sent [[Marius Lupu]] down to intentionally fuck with [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. 

After a few minutes walk, an injured person in similar leathers to [[Marius Lupu]] makes her way to us. We immediately clock them to be a vampire. With some quick social prep to set up an attack, while [[Hugh|Finn]] warns us there are more closing in.

We get slowed to start, which is super annoying, but then do an excellent job decimating the vampires and preventing the bone claw from doing damage. So much so, the emotional vampires still alive decide to flee, at least until [[Costi]] traps them into a force cage fighting ring - that then turns into a hamster ball chase with [[Freya]] and a dead vampire rolling along. We follow the blood trail of the one emotional vampire who escaped [[Wenric]]. 

Along the way, we see about 4 [[Eberronian Military]] guards who have been very recently drained. [[Hugh|Finn]] takes their ID patches for evidence. We also keep the keyring they used. 

We decide to short rest, and try to convince [[Marius Lupu]] to take a nap - he doesn't bite. In telling our story, we learn that the [[Eberron]] government allows tenet unions to feel better about their management, and sometimes they install things without governmental approval. We give [[Marius Lupu]]'s real name. We learn they've already been looking for him, he's wanted for a number of attacks on garrisons. We tell about how the stole keys and weapons, freeing the bone creature. [[Colvia Ghul]] takes particular note of this, and specifically asks what the creature was wearing. Her only response is, "interesting... it simply answers a question that I had". We give them the keys and notes, we found. 

We also share about the bombs, [[ELA]] believing they have an attack hidden, and increasing our opinion. [[Jehneim Bastienev]] says it's unfortunate, but they'll minimize the military casualties and allow the bombs to go off. She seems unworried about having to recreate work. This is worst outcome to our actions. 

[[Wenric]] had a 'particular relationship' to a member of the Duke's family and is growing in psychic powers. He can read surface level thoughts as it relates to strong emotion. They had believe it was just joy, we say not so much. She calls them 'psionic spawn'. 

Suddenly, [[Freya]] is hit with horrific agonizing stomach pain, and begins writhing on the ground. [[Jehneim Bastienev]] makes it clear that we are not to help her, and to continue to the report. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is the only one able to continue, [[Hugh|Finn]] gets wracked by anxiety, [[Rez]] is unable to stifle uncomfortable giggles, and [[Costi]] goes silent. When [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks why they're choosing this, they say there was one part of our failure, so we have one punishment. But we did adequate enough they will also see to our payment. After a horrifying few more minutes of watching [[Freya]] suffer, she finally feels better, and we're able to leave. 

We finally make it back to our house and debrief together.
