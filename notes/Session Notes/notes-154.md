# Detailed Notes: Session 154

We sneak ahead towards where we think the final freed vampires are hiding out. [[Costi]] reminisces some about [[Marius Lupu]], and how he was always even more radical than [[Costi]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] analyzes but doesn't think either [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] or [[Jehneim Bastienev]] intentionally sent [[Marius Lupu]] down to intentionally fuck with [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. 

After a few minutes walk, an injured person in similar leathers to [[Marius Lupu]] makes her way to us. We immediately clock them to be a vampire. With some quick social prep to set up an attack, while [[Hugh|Finn]] warns us there are more closing in.

We get slowed to start, which is super annoying, but then do an excellent job decimating the vampires and preventing the bone claw from doing damage. So much so, the emotional vampires still alive decide to flee, at least until [[Costi]] traps them into a force cage fighting ring - that then turns into a hamster ball chase with [[Freya]] and a dead vampire rolling along. We follow the blood trail of the one emotional vampire who escaped [[Wenric]]. 

Along the way, we see about 4 [[Eberronian Military]] guards who have been very recently drained. [[Hugh|Finn]] takes their ID patches for evidence. We also keep the keyring they used.
