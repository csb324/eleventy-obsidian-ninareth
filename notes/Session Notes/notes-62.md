# Detailed Notes: Session 62

We wake up in the [[Copper Mines]]. We chat through our upcoming fight, consult our instructions for our path, and begin the journey towards the rendezvous points. [[Hugh]] casts death ward on himself, and the whole of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] tries the positive affirmation on ourselves as well.

We give [[Jade]] the [[Lightning Javelin]], and talk out how we're sharing resources. [[Hugh]] has [[Blow Em]], [[Freya]] will longstrider, [[Jade]] will take the potion of fly, [[Rez]] will take the potion of invisibility, [[Costi]] will have the [[Cube of Force]], and [[Rhene Blackstone]] has his [[Boots of the Airness]]. 

[[Freya]] puts the copper bag from the Golem into the pedastal, and it opens to reveal a staircase. We begin the journey as stealthy as we are capable of. As we travel through, [[Hugh]] notices some white marks on the back of the door we just moved through, as though something recently raked nails across it. [[Costi]] and [[Rhene Blackstone]] both try to understand it, and fail miserably. [[Hugh]] recognizes it as pickaxe marks, which we think might be the duergar.

In case there is anything game changing, [[Freya]] opens [[my hole]] to look for anything interesting. [[Jade]] goes with her, and they find a chest of some sort and a box wrapped in chains. Tested and true we move onward. As we trael, [[Hugh]] notices a bit of shifting rock on the side of the tunnel. We all look to see what it might be. He goes over to investigate, and is whirled around. Behind him, holding a glowing purple blade over his neck, is a giant gray dwarf. [[Costi]] tries to charm person, and the duergar counterspells it. He seems to recognize [[Rhene Blackstone]] but only as above-grounders, and [[Jade]] starts to talk in undercommon. 

He, named [[Kruthukar]], shares that his people are here against their will. We learn that a few months ago the duergar commander started acting erratically, the one we're speaking to is his chief counselor. He warned against disturbing the status quo, but was overruled. A week ago he went to his chambers and heard many voices, but was speaking with the beholder and a man, covered in an illusion to appear like an above-grounder, but was really a devil named [[Jhenk]]. Under the illusion, he looks like a handsome gay man who does not wear a shirt. He has purple wings, small forehead horns, and scaled skin - sounds like incubi.

[[Freya]] reads that he's clearly afraid and is being forceful to try and convince us to help. He overheard that they're looking for gold and riches. Their people are have a trade dispute between several tribes of svirfneblin, and debts are being called in. He does not think that's worth the current route they're taking. [[Hugh]] believes them to be horrible bastardization of everything that makes dwarves good, but [[Jade]] views them to be a people that have been cut off and villanized who are actually an industrious people. 

He asks if we free his commander from his mental enchantment, he and all of their people will help us kill the beholder. They'll wait outside the room and once they're outide the charm and [[Kruthukar]] doesn't have to risk hurting his people, he'll come fight with us.

His commander is [[Xcanthak]], he's larger than the rest of his people, older but strong. He weilds a greataxe. To get to the lair, we have to go through many of his people. He'll show us another way - a secret path the resistance has made. Only he and his four captians have retained their mental strength. He thinks we will probably fight the duergar, the beholder, and the inclubi together. He thinks it will try to corrupt our minds, so we should prepare for that. He believes if we kill the incubi it will end the mental enslavement. He thinks [[Jhenk]] will try to hide, so we need to harm him first.

One of the other duergar approaches [[Rhene Blackstone]] and apologizes for what happened last week, that she wasn't herself. He responds that if they help us solve this, all will be forgiven. They share a quiet moment.

On the way, [[Jade]] creates intellect fortress on [[Freya]] and [[Rhene Blackstone]], to protect them from the incubi. We also plan to do all of our other boons and potions, right before we go into the room. As we do, [[Kruthukar]] thanks us for freeing his people and promises that he will get up topside. We take a breath, and open the door.

We get royally fucked, and suffer from a slew of conditions. Notably, [[Rez]] panicking, pulls out her gray scale from [[The Curator]], and it recharges her metamagic and breaks the petrification rising along her skin.

After the beholder is slain, [[Kruthukar]] convinces the rest of the duergar that we were helpful, and that we should not be attacked. They help us get the [[Fire Raisers]] package out from the lava trap.  [[Hugh]] gets some monster parts from the Beholder. He says if there's every anything we need from [[Xcanthak]], they owe us a favor. [[Dornabad]] is the name of their community.  [[Hugh]] offers help if they are ever in [[Zilvengrod]], and [[Jade]] recommends time in [[Thalfar]]. Someone gives [[Rhene Blackstone]] three yellow and orange tags, for Stoke, Zhorra, and Dark Eye. We put the package into the cart, and it goes on it's way to the [[Copper Foundry]].

[[Kruthukar]] says he'll update us once he talks to [[Xcanthak]] about what happens. He says they have a city deep underground, named [[Dornabad]], and gives us 6 coins with x's on them, that will show we have the favor of [[Xcanthak]] to any duergar. 

We make our way out of the tunnel, and arrive back at the [[Copper Mine Union Hall]]. [[Hugh]] makes us sneakier and we try to quietly go our way out. We rush past the workers there and make it back to the [[Chapel of the Lost]] without issue. An undercover [[Fire Raisers]] member slips a note into [[Rhene Blackstone]]'s pocket, it reads: "Congratulations on a job well done. Come to [[Flyte]] for your just rewards - [[Willum]]", as he turns to say goodbye to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], thanking us for our help against the beholder, [[Jade]] invites him back for "something he left in her room". She warns him off any extremism but he's too distracted stripping. While they're gone, [[Rez]] messages the agent to tell them we accomplished our mission, and they say [[Willum]] will be in touch.

On our journey back up to the topside, he sendings to [[Costi's mom]]: "Sending from Hugh to costis mom: Hello wife, update: fought beholder. Also Costi killed devil. Everyone lived. Any additional information on Pruevki? He did not show. Tell Nadia I miss her."
