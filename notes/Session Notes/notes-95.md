# Detailed Notes: Session 95

Over our journey to [[Eberron]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] finds [[Sienna Burbank]] for a chat. With her is a halfing, [[Zuthrun]] and a warforged, [[Dania]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] offers [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] the bargaining chip for [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] to tell [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] about her being alive.  The idea is appealing, and she suggest they move quickly. She recognizes [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] will need an explanation for our time in [[Eberron]], but offers for that to be a collaborative line. 

[[Dania]] drafts a letter (in [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]'s hand), "Jules, wanted to let you know [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] wanted to do a favor for the [[Grosu]] boy and [[Hugh]], picked them up and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s here. Trying to get a little more information, but thought you should know she's back. l will keep you updated." [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] approves and it's suggested for all of our input, before we send it off to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. We clarify a bit with [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] and confirm it's good to go. She says [[Costi]]'s political status in [[Arkhosia]] provides some cover, plus it can be helpful for [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] to "occasionally make these blunders in front of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]"

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] warns that too many questions between [[Dania]] and [[Hugh]] could hurt his mind, depending on the questions he asks. It seems like she's not subjected to the same restraints as [[Hugh]]. 

[[Hugh]] and [[Dania]] talk some, but he's able to see she's artificially shortening her dialogue with him. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] warns him that [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] asked her not to put him at risk. He asked if he knows her, and she says she has not met *Hugh*. We try to get clarity and are pushed back until [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] is with us. [[Dania]] gifts him a cinnamon roll and some bugs for [[Maurice]].

On the way, we fly by [[Deal 'Ras]] - [[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] get a glimpse of their home and talk about their growth since they were last there. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gets a visitor from [[The Curator]]. She divine senses and gets a very strong undead presence from them. They welcome her back to life. She's standoffish, and [[The Curator]] asks what being dead is like - [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] says it was 'reasonably pleasant'. It's tense and awkward, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is not even playing at being interested in their relationship. They ask if there's anything [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] needs, and she say not at the moment, she has it under control. 

[[Rez]] gets visited by [[The Curator]]. The Curator was "tied up." The Curator asks if there is anything she can do to help re [[Rezâ€™s Sister Neti]]. The Curator says she would expect a favor in return. Either it will be "in line," or she will owe Rez. "What if I want a lot of people dead?" The Curator offers a network, Rez wants a "snap." [[Rez]] asks if she should wait instead on her outstanding favor, and is told the next time Rez is at [[Slavaadi College]], the Curator will pay a visit. Rez decides to wait on murder, if it's just her network versus theirs, and the Curator offers a [[Curator Bell]] to ring if Rez changes her mind - for broad help, or for more targeted information on those involved in [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]] in [[Eberron]]. 

[[Freya]] is the last to be visited. She immediately asks about her blood, saying she hasn't seen [[The Curator]]. Part of it was used, the remaining parts were destroyed. She thanks her for the tattoo. [[Freya]] expresses some concerns about the uses for blood, and [[The Curator]] says "as long as they are in good standing" she'd never favor one member in her collection over another. When asked about [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]], [[The Curator]] wants another favor for it - and hints that our time in [[Eberron]] will be interesting, and give us "more information than you might expect". [[The Curator]] thinks our relationship with the [[Sienna Burbank|Burbanks]] will pay dividends for both of them. Then they ask for a favor - they want [[Freya]] to keep [[Curator Blue Marble]] in her pocket. It's personal, they just need to check-in on something. She's told it won't hurt her or [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], but it should be kept secret - and she'll get a favor in return. Hinting at a reward, [[The Curator]] holds up a hand, then flashes their finger gold. 

[[Costi]] asks [[Dania]] what she does for fun for [[Hugh]]'s sake - she responds reading. 

We finally make it to the [[Burbank Compound]] - it's substantially bigger that [[Tinzelven]], with thousands of people and 15 foot high walls surrounding it. [[Eberronian Military]] tents are throughout and around the compound itself. As we make the journey into the main compound, we see dozens of soldiers, and a significant number of warforged as well, around 15 and only half are carrying weapons. They seem to be casual, some laughing, one eating. It's not what we'd expect. 

When we arrive, we learn this is [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s second home - it was their personal, non-ancestral home, but they've moved their command center there. Everyone here is a "small portion of the [[Eberronian Second Division]]". They've been there about a decade, [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] has been a colonel for 11 years.

We're told everyone on the compound is vetted and told to leave us alone, but we should avoid the windows and not trust that it's safe outside the walls. We're invited to lunch with the [[Burbanks]]. We decide to explore the area around our rooms. It's clear that they're tracking our movements and warning people as we round corners to get out of our way. We find a music room, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] plays and we have a few staff we remember her. 

[[Costi]] sendings to [[Pruvki Forgaveat]], who tells us that [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] is among the goodest in the [[Eberronian Military]] but we should still not trust. 

We arrive for lunch, and they have place cards to tell us where to sit. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], two 30-somethings, one in [[Eberronian Military]] attire with awards decorating it and a commanders beret [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th]], the other a female in nice conservative dress who bears a strong resemblance to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], [[Trisha]].  [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] is the picture of the older soldier, gray hair and scares, understated uniform and smoking a scar.

He begins lunch by apologizing to [[Hugh]], not for all of [[Eberron]] but for being unable to event the horrible things that happened to him while he served in the [[Beating Heart Battalion]]. He says that's why he brought him here, and if [[Hugh]] likes, he can have him fixed. [[Hugh]] expresses mistrust, but [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] seems as sincere as we can tell - asking for the chance to make it up to him. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says that there are secrets he could share, either to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], or to him, once he is himself. [[Hugh]] decides to trust us, and leaves for us to talk to [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]. He knows an expert who can come and fix him, but the procedure is very dangerous. [[Rez]] asks if he's had anyone that's successfully had their memory fixed. 

He says he knows almost everything about [[Hugh]]. There are only 8 [[SVN models]] left of the 72 made. 5 are unknown. One, goes by [[Sven]] who serves as [[Duke v'Luthei]]'s personal guard. Another is here, named [[Marigold]]. She has undergone the procedure, and it mostly worked - she's about 80% back. 

[[Hugh]] is one of the oldest versions of the warforged, about 283 year old from what he knows. He was created by [[]], an early progenitor of the [[Treddleston]] - where most of our knowledge on empowered golems come from. [[Eberron]] was the first nation to use that information to create autonomous beings. Other nations have yet to repeat that true sentient design. 

[[SVN models]] have not been repeated as an experiment, most of them have been destroyed. It is unclear where souls come from, people believed for the majority of history that warforged did not contain souls -  [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] know believes that even if all warforged don't, most do and it's worth treating them like they all do.

[[Hugh]] seems to be an outlier, his memory seems to be wiped more than any other warforged. There have 136 variations of him. 6 wipes occurred under [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s awareness. It seems like they were all due to his behavior, they're not a routine procedure. It seems the periods between ranged from 15 days to a few years. Almost all of them were attributed to [[Hugh]] not wanting to be in combat. [[Marigold]] seemed to have her mind wiped 87 times, but they're not sure what percent of her total memories is back. 

It seems like the [[SVN models]] is valuable enough that it's worth the continuous resetting. 

[[Hugh]] was under [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]'s command 23 years ago, he had not been seen in that time. The last time was when [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] was court-martialed for disobeying a direct order. He disobeyed [[Major Teld]], who still serves, and it lead to an altercation. [[Hugh]] intervened, and [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] made enough of a distraction of himself that he could escape. No one knows how he evaded trackers for 22 years. He popped up briefly in the [[Tropics]] about a year and half to two years ago, before the protection of  [[Moradin]] temples. 

[[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] believes undead are a strategic miscalculation - soldiers should be loyal to him not to whoever raised them. It's why the [[Beating Heart Battalion]] was given it's name. He didn't have enough capital to fight that fight and to protect the warforged simultaneously. 

The expert, [[Quinn Keplin]], knows warforged better than anyone else, as they are one. [[Quinn Keplin]] was part of wiping [[Hugh]]'s memories. It would take 3 weeks from him to arrive at the [[Burbank Compound]]. Many of the warforged here are in full control of their faculties, and a decent number might know [[SVN529]]. We need to be sure they don't greet him and trigger his memory-spiral.

Each wipe requires an additional mental ward, and each time his mind shut down makes it more dangerous to try and recover him. 

We ask if, they need contractors to help strategically track down organics from [[Hugh]]'s file and his history. [[Fivey]] says he'll run it up the chain. 

[[Hugh]] comes back in, and shows [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] the drawings from his visions, and he gets confirmation that [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] recognizes 2 of them. He'll say more if [[Hugh]] gets his memory back. He asks us what each of our votes are, we all end up at yes. [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] warns that he might find parts of himself he does not like. We learn that the procedure takes a few hours, and might even make him protected from future memory-spirals. With care, we can try to ground his current personality. There are also potential side effects, different variations in his skills and abilities. 

With that, [[Hugh]] makes the choice to go forward with it. 

We turn to discuss [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] - the most incompetent soldier that ever served under [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]]. Drafted 25 years ago, served about 2 years, and in that time made a mess of a significant number of military operations. He was the only private he ever put in charge of a platoon, and excelled as a medic. [[Major Teld]] was in control of the larger unit, a big minotaur, and a jerk according to [[Hugh]]. [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] was instructed to kill a group of insurgents, he was whipped as punishment, and [[Hugh]] intervened before he could get through 11 of his 21. [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] was then imprisoned in [[Eberron]] for 3 years, then released early instead of serving 17 years, it's unclear why. 

He was re-drafted about 3 years ago, approximately two months after joining the ranks, he went missing and was presumed dead - as he is today.

Asked about the [[ELA]] he says each duchy is home to a different band who operate semi-independently from each other. They're largely made up of deserters. [[Costi]] asks for any information he can find, and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] says he'll put his best on it.

He works with the [[Baron Pendaras Nushkev]], and gets crimes reported to him for justice. Unsanctioned necromancy has been an issue, because non-military use is highly regulated. Recently, in a town just north of here, [[Viliki]], has had reports of practice there. We said we'd be able to figure out the range, as we've heard of middle ground cases - by the way have they heard of a man named [[Von]]? Seems like there's no one in the official military that goes by that name. 

Before he leaves, [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] says [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is "thrilled" to hear of her return, and might be coming by. He's aiming to be here in 5 days, he would be upset if we got started on our investigation before that time. He's not worried about blowback, he's used to going toe to toe with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], and has been none to make these sorts of mistakes before.

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] divine senses again, and sees an interesting extra ping of desecration on [[Freya]]. That's weird. 

[[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] briefs us about northern [[Nushkev]] is a few days away by walking. Reports are scattered, a shipment was due to a nearby establishment run by the third division of blood, bone, and other materials needed for necromancy and it's missing. Some of those items are believed to have been found in [[Viliki]], along with some unexplained disappearances and unusual death rates. It's 11% higher than it should be over the last 6 months. [[Trisha]] has a few people in the town that we could talk to that are outside the [[Eberronian Military]]. She offers to accompany us on our trip. She'll prepare a dossier, and we'll plan to leave at dawn in 3 days. 

We discuss some tours for the next day, [[Hugh]] to the gardens, [[Freya]] to the dungeons. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is also encouraged to give another concert. [[Costi]] plans to visit the library. 

We go back to our suite and are kindly requested to stay there for the rest of the day. We search for any listening devices or scrying, don't find anything. Though we do find a secret tunnel in case we need to escape. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] calls [[Freya]] out on the [[Curator Blue Marble]], and a detect magic shows it to be conjuration. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] talks about it, and give [[Freya]] some deserved crap. [[Costi]] uses magic to try and understand the orb without touching it. It gives a very faint magical aura, it radiates coldness, like a tiny little void. 

We argue about their trustworthiness and the fact that [[The Second Sundering]] is confirmed to be undead now. [[Freya]] recognizes she messed up, but won't say that she won't make more deals. We try to agree to a group waiting period and discussion, once we know all the details. 

[[Costi]] steps aside to ask [[Samuel]] who [[The Curator]] is, and requests he ask [[The Raven Queen]]. 

[[Freya]] tries to ask [[The Curator]] if they were listening, but no response.

[[Hugh]] brings out the scrying focus and asks if we should check in on anyone, and suggests [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s brother. He says he looked "disappointed". We say our letter is probably in pretty poor taste now, and discuss who, if anyone, should send to him. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] decides to do something herself tomorrow. She says that [[Darek Spout]] hates her for abandoning the family.

Considering a longer letter, [[Rez]] suggests she could send to someone in [[Zmaj]]'s group who could dictate. She sendings to [[Ravona Silentreed]]. She's still in [[Dilandil]] and agreed to help. 

[[Hugh]] tries to scry on [[Von]] but it doesn't work. 

[[Costi]] talks about if he should avoid conscription by enlisting under [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]], [[Hugh]] is concerned, but we think it might be a way to avoid him getting banished. 

As [[Freya]] is falling asleep, she feels a sharp coldness over the spot in her back. She asks if they're going to talk, but she just passive aggressively pokes in various amounts of near-pain. [[Freya]] is confused on what the ask is. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] gets involved, but mostly just to watch confusedly. 

Eventually she's instructed to place the [[Curator Blue Marble]] under her bed on the floor. It's disappeared. She tells [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] she's sorry and knows that was not good. But still asks [[The Curator]] to come speak to her. 

[[Rez]] [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Costi]] discuss if we should warn the [[Burbanks]]. We decide to tell, and say [[Freya]] got conned, and keep our secrets. [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] hide in their rooms so [[The Curator]] can't watch, and [[Costi]] gives the bad news to [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] - because [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] and [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] are away from [[Burbank Compound]] tonight. [[Costi]] draws what it looks like and describes the kind of magic it'll give off. He says he doesn't think it was listening beforehand, but worries it might now. 

[[The Curator]] says they heard the conversation, but [[Freya]] did the job, why would they be upset? They also say the meddling from [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] won't ruin anything either. [[Freya]] asks outright if they're undead, but they don't answer. [[The Curator]] reassures [[Freya]] that they've been digging into the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles |Mysterious Circles]], they were able to find the location of the alhoon  [[Mhrhaal]]. However, [[The Curator]] says telling us broke their deal, because we told someone else. [[Freya]] asks how to unbreak the deal, and they say if they do another job then they'll overlook this transgression. She tries to get assurances that it won't affect anyone in [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] and the [[Burbanks]], but [[The Curator]] won't budge. Either [[Freya]] makes the deal or she's on probation. She agrees. [[Freya]]'s hand momentarily turns bone white after she shakes on the deal. That's not alarming. 

[[The Curator]] shares that within the last two weeks [[Mhrhaal]] has been seen under [[New Fairhaven]]. They have reason to believe that he might be in league with some very powerful people, [[Duke v'Bihor]]'s family. (This aligns with what [[Wyn Elreal]] told us about [[Von]]) She says, let's just say there might be one extra baron in [[New Fairhaven]].
