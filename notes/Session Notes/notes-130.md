# Detailed Notes: Session 130

[[Rez]] wakes up and plays telephone between the two warring groups. First, getting the read out from [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Costi]], then talking to [[Freya]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. 

She questions how we all just let, nevermind PAID, for innocent people to be murdered in our place. Everyone claims they were not to blame.

[[Rez]] does try to counteract [[Freya]] feeling like she's unimportant to us - but she doesn't know how to trust people caring, and [[Rez]] isn't sure how one can 'prove' affection. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to moderate and get the two groups to meet, attempting some tough love mixed with validation. [[Costi]] says the core of his anger is the implication that [[Freya]] is fine with death if it gets her what she wants. 

We all argue about whether or not the ends justify the means, and if so, which means? We don't know. 

We mutually reassure each other that we all care, [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] try to explain what family means, which pivots to [[Polaris]]. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] promises [[Freya]] we will find out what happened to her, and [[The Curator]] is not her only path there. 

At the end, we agree that if [[The Curator]] works with those interested but doesn't risk their lives or involve the rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] that is okay. [[Costi]] asks if [[Samuel]] what he thought upon further looking into [[The Curator]] and he doesn't seem to recognize the topic or question. What's that about?? [[Costi]] tries to figure out how he could talk to [[The Raven Queen]], which [[Rez]] commiserates on. [[Samuel]] agrees with [[Hugh|Finn]] that we should read more books. 

[[Freya]] offers keeping [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] out of her efforts with [[The Curator]], and trying to be aware of what we'd think was a risk, while caring more about others. [[Costi]], then everyone else, does say the most important addition is that she cares are about her own life too. 

This prompts her to say that when she died, she had an option to come back, and chose us. She thinks she might have 'extra options'. We discuss and it prompts [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to realize that [[The Curator]] tried to intervene for her as well - but it doesn't always work. 

We end in a good spot, including a group hug. 

On the walk, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] does some internal soul searching to see if [[Corellon Larethian]] has any lingering feelings within her own soulscape on [[The Curator]], but she doesn't pick up anything.

[[Hugh|Finn]] asks [[Costi]] if he's nervous going to [[Jezeten]]. He's nervous about lying, and faking his loyalty. [[Hugh|Finn]] encourages him to lean into his desire to 'better [[Eberron]]'. He's excited to see [[Costi's mom]] and [[Nadia]], but everyone knows he left to find [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] and he's failed. He then pivots to telling us about the [[Frozen Face Spire]], a magical marvel clock telling *future* time, but doing nothing about it. It's emblematic of [[AVAD]] to him, useless but self-important. 

As we approach the outskirts of the city, we're spotted by a small rosy cheek woman, noticeably overdressed, waving enthusiastically. She's not immediately familiar to us, but seems to be expecting [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. She introduces herself as [[Sylvia]] and was hired to deliver a message, sent by [[Rughork]], an orc from [[Thelran Asari]], but she doesn't have the message - she can take us to the person who has the message. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sees nothing of falsity or concern in her demeanor. 

She's a professor of the [[Nine Hells]] and a professor at the [[The Slavaadi College]]. Our message is from a devil. She doesn't know much more, she's in a lot (100GP) of debt. She recognizes [[Rhend Triverswill]], but not [[Professor Vendorsmere]]. Seems legit. They were calibrated to [[Costi]] to find [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]].

We take our chances and head to her prepared summoning circle. A large buglike creature holding a trident, with two smaller devils beside it, appear. It immediately crosses the barrier and murders [[Sylvia]] on the spot, then saying "He is displeased". [[Rez]] asks "Why?" "It is not for me, it is for me to extract his pound of flesh"- [[Costi]] translates "He doesn't know!"

We quickly take care of the three of them, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] interrogates [[Sylvia]]. They contacted her at the [[Mage Hall]] at [[AVAD]], and a posting was on a job board. She contacted them by sending, and she was told to find [[Costi]] using the [[Compass of Location]], which we take. It was given to her at the front desk, by a woman with light hair (blonde or white). 

[[Hugh|Finn]] takes the [[Compass of Location]] to try and scry on [[Rughork]], but he manages to resist. She's been looking for us for two weeks, she saw the flyer 3 weeks ago and negotiated for a few days before accepting (70gp, half up front half after the message was delivered).

She says immediately the ice devil, [[Phroliwwp]] is probably from the [[2nd Level of Hell]]. We discuss if she'll follow up with [[Rughork]], she suggests becoming a mole (and a dinner date). [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]  party confiscates her [[sending stone]]. We craft a sending for her, "It went badly - I've won their trust. Bringing to [[Jezeten]], I'll lead to new location. Tell me where. Do you want to stay at mine?" she says he responds, "Sounds good. Will figure it out later. Keep an eye on them. I'll crash with you when I'm in town."

Ahead, we see the twin cities of [[Jezeten]] and [[Deal 'Ras]].
