# Detailed Notes: Session 111

We start by having them tell us to drop our weapons. Then ignoring their requests, we discuss how the [[Eberronian Military]] scrys on their soldiers, and as them to make it look like we're kidnapped, regardless of if they think they really are doing it. We try and talk more through it, but they cast Silence to shut us up. 

At this point, [[Hugh|Finn]] shows up holding lots of little rocks. He notices we're happy to be tied up, but not in time to prevent getting shot. He mentions [[Costi's mom]] but they don't recognize the name. They bind him up too, and tell us to walk quietly. It does NOT go well.

Instead, we jog until we reach a hidden break in the rock that leads to a winding tunnel. It's similar to the tunnels we ran through earlier. Realizing [[Thurath]] would be leaving mole form soon, [[Costi]] uses some of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s blood to look hurt, while [[Rez]] gets her nose broken by [[Freya]]. The [[ELA]] troops eventually subdue him, and tie him up with the rest of us. 

Sick of our shit, they blindfold all of us for the rest of the journey. We travel for hours, at least 8. Eventually, our blindfolds are removed and we find ourselves in a circular room within the tunnels to rest. The offer to keep watch and we give them lots of shit. [[Freya]] asks them to beat her up, but rages and negs him pretty hard through out it. Then we all go to sleep. 

In the morning, we continue our trek until we're brought to a room within a building. They chain us to the wall, and hand [[Thurath]] upside down. A halfling with a light beard, muscular build, enters the room and immediately murders [[Thurath]]. 

Studying [[Costi]], he recognizes [[Costi's mom]]'s features and then unlocks him before smacking him to check for an illusion. Once that passes, hugs him, before [[Costi]] reminds him we might be being watched!! He chains [[Costi]] back up and leaves the room again.

The halfling [[Devkorus Kaa]] returns with a small group, one of whom ([[Tyros]]) uses a scroll to confirm we're not being watched right now. He says he met [[Costi]] when he was a baby, but pushes us to talk to [[Willow]] first. We agree that if they notice a scrying sensor we'll act as though we just escaped.

We're in the outskirts of [[Golstrava]], and see a few other [[ELA]] soldiers on watch. Led to [[Willow]], we see him dressed nicely, with a scimitar and a large hat. As an introduction, he kneels before [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], calling her "Rose" and a "Blue Rose". She asks for a private place to speak with him.

He asks about her time in [[the Grove]], and she asks him to explain himself. He says he's [[Corellon Larethian]] [[oracle]] communicating with him directly regularly and a channel for him in the world. He says her harp playing, and specifically "the song he was looking for" and some vines reaction told him she was chosen by [[Corellon Larethian]]. Chosen to save the world - the danger has something to do with [[Heal the Anchor Tree]], he doesn't know much. He doesn't know [[Wyn Elreal]]. 

He apologizes for following her around, as [[No-Karo]] told him makes people uncomfortable. He's also been scrying on her, it's why he gave her the knife. He's stopped, but when she tells him it's too late for that, he says okay! [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks if he poisoned her, he says no. She asks how many things have been him: the scholarship to [[Redscale]], a few nudges, etc. 

He took a boat here from [[The Tendrils]] because he had to talk to [[No-Karo]]. [[The Burning Sons]] are pretty mad at us, but he doesn't think he's mad at us. He gives each of us a [[Pelor Token]] in case we ever need anything from him. [[Tanim]] is the [[Moradin]] oracle, he's "testy". [[Rhehned]] is the oracle for [[Bahamut]], an old blue dragonborn. These are the only gods he knows of with oracles. They all have watchers, different ones than his. 

We ask if knows about [[Alhoon]] or [[Sezathkathon]], he doesn't. But asks how [[G'zraad]] tasks went, but gets distracted. He asks when we're going to [[New Fairhaven]], because every time he looks at it non a map he gets an overwhelming feeling of dread, and even fainted last time. A few weeks ago, he had an uncontrollable urge to stare south, saw a light on the horizon, and had a feeling of questioning, unknown strong need. 

He, worryingly, says he doesn't know when he'll see us next. And can't say anything about if we'll die in [[New Fairhaven]]. We can expect to meet a friend there. We asks for heads up if anyone else is also assigned to do the same thing we are. 

[[Willow]] offers to pass along who do they work for, what are their goals, what do they know about the threat to the prime material, but they won't come talk to us because they don't like to interefere with mortals, and willow claims to be half-and-half.

He can't eat lambs on ravens day, associated with two gods: [[Pelor]] (alive) and [[Yondala]] (prepared), he saw one talking to a raven. [[Corellon Larethian]] has tried to convince other gods to help, but he can't say who. 

He's seen other creatures with gold appendages and knows [[G'zraad]] is in his phylactery, he might know if that changes. There's been other blue roses in the past, who did important things for [[Corellon Larethian]]. He lists some songs about them.

[[Freya]] asks [[The Curator]] if the [[Alhoon]] is still there. We have some time though. [[Costi]] secretly asks if he knows about [[The Curator]], and [[Willow]] doesn’t and doesn’t even seem particularly interested, but Costi tells him to ask correllon to look into it, that they touch everything. His eyes go bought blue, then says porcelain masks and he met them once about 56 years ago. They had tea and invited him to join the collection he declined. costi warns corellon its hard to know what they want and thinks they have their own aims.

he says if anyone is interested in joining [[The Order of the Blue Rose]], he'll send them to her. They've been interested in her legend. Shes the third bearer of the [[Yew Sword]]. He can't induct them in, thats [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'a job. 

before he leaves he asks her for a song, and thanks her for her blessing.

we talk about how [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] feels, she says its weird. she connects with [[Hugh|Finn]] on being chosen by a god, though he seems slow to admit it

[[Devkorus Kaa]] Lived in [[Deal 'Ras]] knew both Costi parents believe [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] is dead. 

[[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] was on assignment in [[Luthei Region]]. Conflicting reports. Some say they’ve gotten a missive from him. We realize we haven’t scryed! Last message from vlad was 6ish months ago. But they’re regarding it with suspicion. Possible traps. presumed dead. 

have drop spots, and knows they have internal moles, so they don't trust any messages from him. 

we warn them we foudn their orbs, they claim the high level casters are friends. we warn about slavaddi college and they say it could be good to encourage them as enemies

we discuss if we can go back, with thurath dead and the likelihood that we've been scryed on, and devkorus recommends we come back with actionable information, like the locaiton of some their camps. They have some volunteers to be at camps we turn in. 

we say leaving the supply lines unattacked could be a point towards our credibikity in case they are testing our group withi information in vcase they like. 

say were one of their most important assets, and information is our main help. they want heads up on nattacks, hope to avoid golstrava, their marsh bog traps have been very successgul. Ask that we avoid killing as many of them as possible. 

we ask about burbank, they say he's a climber less cruel than most but expect he'd do anyhting for more power. it would be helpful to increase tensions with his and the first divisions, would make their work in jezeten easier. he didn't seem focused on him in particular.

we asked about the undead, they say they interrupted the shipment decided to let the army kill them for them, and take out some on the way. 

they say someone on their team was monitoring the weapons factory but it wasn't a top priority.

several of their camps in the ravine were overtaken now that they know about the orbs. There's projects in golstrava they don't want to leave, so if the armies do make it there they'll have speciric requests for us. 

they design some papers we can steal with good short term action that can verify and longer term actions that are advantageous to them. finn asks why he got involved in the ela, he says his wife was a supporter and was killed as a result - he does it for her, Mebian.

they are able to infer the military strategy but we didn't outright comment. we decide we might say we let them kidnap us to try to gain information. he says there's some names in new fairhaven they can give to us.

[[Costi]] asks about [[Marius Lupu]], "Loops", and its confirmed he's part of [[ELA]]. Last in [[Jezeten]].

we plan to stage our break out for as soon as we notice them scrying on us, and then have them waiting where we can overwhelm a few people and break into a room and get some documents. 

We get the signal that we're being scryed on, and stage our escape. we ask freya to listen for quiet, the break our chains, [[Costi]] picks the lock, knock out the guard, search him, get a key and hp. go to the first get our stuff [[Rez]] incites greed tricks them whoever gives most info gets stone, they point us to next room, we enter overcome the two guards inside. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] holds back up in the hall, [[Rez]] convince guards to write whatever is best info for stones. [[Costi]] polymorphs [[Devkorus Kaa]] into a small dog and tosses him out the window. We search for docs, then determine we have enough and get out. As we leave, we avoid net find our way out head towards ravine and [[Colvia Ghul]].

Once we're sure it's safeish, we look through docs we took. It includes information on the last remaining ravine hideouts 62, troop numbers, casualty counts, info on [[Eberronian Military]], surveillance network and points, weapons caches, indicates after [[ELA]]'s success repelling troops a number of monstrosities are no longer under their control, encoded info too. 

[[Rez]] sending to [[Colvia Ghul]] "big news - infiltration plan success! Met [[ELA]], got caught, got good info!! On our way back with stolen intelligence: ravine hideouts, troop numbers, surveillance networks". She replies, "Congratulations! I must have missed the approval of that infiltration plan, but happy it worked! Looking forward to reviewing this information and determining next steps."
