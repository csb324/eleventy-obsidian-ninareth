# Session 161

With a brief conversation, [[Jehneim Bastienev]] expresses a bored surprise that we are the assassins they knew would be coming to them. [[Costi]] owns up to it, that we are there to kill them, and make [[Eberron]] the place we know it can be. 

[[Colvia Ghul]] betrays [[Jehneim Bastienev]] saying "I'm so sorry, I need this one (pointing at [[Freya]])", she later tries to convince the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] to attack the rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] instead. She reveals some dramatic chain arms, in which the [[Ioun Stone]]s from her former party (at the time of [[Golstrava]]) are embedded into her arms. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] kills one of the bound hostages with ruby in their head on the ceiling. 

[[Colvia Ghul]] takes a special interest in keeping [[Freya]] alive, saying, "I've got you, [[Synchrona]]"

[[Duchess v'Dharinov]] says to [[Colvia Ghul]], "now what do you think the [[Nakhodiztka]] will think of this?" 

[[Colvia Ghul]] kills [[Jehneim Bastienev]] in the sunlight [[Costi]] casts, permanently killing her.

After a grueling battle, [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] tees up our abilities to target [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. [[Rez]] psychic lances her to render her incapacitated, then [[Freya]] hits with the the [[Arrow of Vampire Slaying]], then embedding the [[ELA Ebony Stake]] deep in the back of her head. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] heals [[Hugh|Finn]] before attacking the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]], which [[Hugh|Finn]] turns into a critical hit, so she uses a huge amount of radiant energy to smite her. [[Costi]] approaches, holds [[Raven's Edge]] aloft, saying "you brought me here, finish what you started", and allows  [[The Raven Queen]] to consume the tattered remnants of [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]'s soul. 

After clearing the map, we talk briefly with [[Colvia Ghul]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to tease out what information she can, [[Colvia Ghul]] makes it clear she plans to have use of us for a while yet. 

[[Rez]] sends to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] to let her know we did it! And we had some help... [[Marius A]], our witness, and [[Colvia Ghul]], who was still in the room. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] did not expect either.

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] talk to [[Marius A]], thanking him for choosing [[Eberron]]. [[Marius A]] seems a bit taken aback by his choice, but shows no regret. Turns out everything the [[Eberronian First Division]] was saying about [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is true. When he asks what comes next for him, [[Costi]] hints about the modify memory plan.

[[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] enters, and pulls [[Colvia Ghul]] aside. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] intuits that their conversation is shockingly cordial. [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] says we can use this, and  [[Colvia Ghul]] will lead the interrogation into [[Marius A]]. As she leaves, she tells us she'll be in touch soon.
