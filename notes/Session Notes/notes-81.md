# Detailed Notes: Session 81

As [[Cinder]] pierces the [[Ring of Efreet Summoning]] [[Jade]]'s glasses flash ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]?), her briefcase pulls out a card referencing [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]]. 

At some point [[Willum]] uses a thread, thanking [[Winifey|Winnie]], before using some unknown dunamantic power to reverse himself through time and remove damage

[[Jade]] gives [[Costi]] the pin from [[The Curator]].

[[Willum]] stepped through fire and ran away. Coward. 

potential over the fight begins showing glowing lines of red green black then purple

cinder disintegrated everything disappearing

boxes all have similar sigils but a few different ones appearing, the look like they've teleported something, some sort of gray stone and some fine red stone dust, needed enormous magical power to do. 

rez uses her song of creation to create a buckle on the first, freya hits the second and moves to help costi. He tries but can't quite cut through, rez uses the last of her sorcery to give her enough energy to pop up the wall and with her last spell creates another buckle. Costi lines up and tries again, this time successfully cutting through the last fuse. 

costi's eyes roll back in his head and he falls from the cieling. He feels himself falling throwing inky blackness before slowing and touching ground, he's standing on a large wide stretch of steel, running as far as he can see on either side. 4 lights are in the distance, one green, one red, one purple, and one shining black. Looking down at his feet he sees four matching lines running towards them.

He begins moving towards the lights, with the lines underneath getting brighter on each step, a comfortable peace settling over him. Evntually, the steel ends, with a gold bar in front of him, covered in a few risen bumps. Stepping onto the gold platform, he can now see that the lights bracnh into four paths: a purple haze moving and shifting on the far left, a rolling mass of hot red, a soft verdant green that is homey, and on the right most, a sharp deeper black. In between the red and green paths, sits a hunched figure, a 2.5 ft ball of black feather. Sensing [[Costi]], it stands, large taloned feet with human legs, and thick torso covered in feathers, and two long arms holding a huge double bladed axe, ending a beaked head, it stands 14 feet tall

"Samuel", "Hello Costi", where am I?, just having a little breather - good job today, thank you - thanks for the help, it's my job, do you work for someone?, i'm not here to answer any questinos, just here to explain what happens next, oh - what does happen next?, your father made a little bit of a deal - a deal to keep you safe so we've been watching over you for a little while and helped shepard you along your path - but now you're all grown up and it's time for you to make your choice - your father's pact is not yours - you are not to be forced into any decision you do not want to make - if you go down one of these paths, you keep your deal - or you can follow your own (looking back towards the steel) - it's your choice to make, don't bother asking me any questions because I'm not going to tell you - feel free to take a look before you choose because there ain't no unringing this bell

he moves to look at the purple, he sees distortions where it's hard for his mind to process, flashes of his childhood frustrated studying, and glimpses of a decade in the future, strong and holding the blade at war

at the red path, heat is overbearing but he's not uncomfortable, looknig down the flames burn and columns of smoke, he sees the Realdas overssers home (who exciled many of his friends) in flames, he sees a cliffside castle falling into the sea

the green path first has the light and familiar sound of [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s favorite song, deep grass and wildflowers, with ivy covered trellis, flowers scents wafting towards him

the black path is simpler, spiraling out, a thick spine with feathery tendrils like it is one long feather, and the sound of wings. 

strangely, there's another path that [[Samuel]] didn't seem to notice, of straight porcleain, he hears a chuckle and a voice saying "offer is still on the table [[Costi]]"

He asks "if I turn around I cannot come back?" "There's not unringing theis bell, but you leave here with some kind of gift - you gave me too many beetles not to do something for you"

He moves towards the black path, reaching into his pocket, grabbing a beetle throwing it to [[Samuel]] "I've liked having you around, and this one seems more in line with you, sooo I'll see you on the other side" He lets it fall into his mouth and says "welcome to the family [[Costi]]"

He feels a coolness moving over him, at the end, there's nothing. Deciding to embrace, he falls into nothing

healing him from unconsciousness, [[Costi]] is now cooler to the touch, and the black line on [[Potential]] grows, and the center pulls into a line white line, the edges moving into feathery pattern, he now holds [[Raven's Wing]].

We see that the bombs are fused to the wall, but the portal seems to be stabilizing. We decide half of us will stay and protect the bombs, while [[Hugh]] and [[Rez]] go to find [[Victor]]. We speak to him briefly, expressing our concern of people who can help guard the gate, bringing in some members from the army. [[Rez]] says to reach out to [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], he may know how to open them, so he can maybe close them. [[Victor]] says he'll send for him. He tells us to go rest, and then thanks us. 

We go to quickly stop by [[Ellinev Del]]'s office, [[Jade]] grabs every book she can find that Del wrote in. [[Hugh]] and [[Costi]] go to help take care of the bodies, it goes as though it's been natural to them their whole life. 

At this point folks start to catch on, and we're set to wait in our rooms, with the whole [[Suncrest Palace]] being put on lock down. We finally get a minute to rest for a short time. We identify [[Winifey|Winnie]]'s weapon, called the [[Echo Blade]]. [[Costi]] finds a spell from the spell book, Elemental Bane.

[[Victor]] finally comes in and says they've secured the catacombs. They found a number of bound [[Fire Raisers]] disarmed in the top of the building. He's drafted his letter of resignation and confession, planning to stand trials along with all of the others. We try to convince him that the right penance is staying, sitting in his guilt, but using it as a delegate to make the changes that need to be made. They are pushing the [[Arkhosian Elections]] until tomorrow, and much of the story is becoming public, though he's trying to keep the worst details hidden, including protecting [[Ricci Scrucks]] and [[Ellinev Del]]'s legacies. There were a few additional casualties, no one we'd know. 

We ask how this will change things politically, [[Victor]] believes he'll be elected to [[The Circle]], but we'll have to see how things shake out. We say we think we got to [[Niko]] in time, and he tells us to rest until tomorrow. We'll meet him tomorrow at 11:30

The next day, we arrive at the [[Arkhosian Elections]], and see about 1,000 people on the floor, dressed with in [[The Guardians]] colors, [[The Providers]] colors, or the [[Arkhosian Military]]. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] sits on [[The Providers]] side with [[Victor]], except for [[Costi]], who chooses to sit in the non-partisan area. Who is he??

Turns out [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is one of the few exceptions to the lack of guests, who is also in the non-partisan viewing stage. After a moment, he approaches him, citing his surprise at not sitting with the [[The Unforged Few]]. He says after yesterday, he's not sure what he believes. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] approves, and says he's learning - then thanks him for our service to [[Arkhosia]]. If he can ever be in our service, let him know - we might not be in his service, but he thinks of us like family. [[Costi]], who apparently is learning, just thanks him and ends the conversation.

[[Ichlior]] opens the preceding, saying that at least 90 delegates and staff lost their lives yesterday, asking for a moment of silence in respect of them. He also asks [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] to stand, saying we single-handedly prevented the greatest loss of life on civilian grounds in their history. He also calls out [[Victor]], [[Ricci Scrucks]], and [[Ellinev Del]] for their leadership. [[Henrik]] is now a delegate for [[The Providers]]??? He interjects as the votes are about to be counted. He gives a rousing speech, condemning the [[Fire Raisers]], but saying that this government created a situation where it could be possible. He says he's founding [[The Listeners]], and as soon as he's done, [[Del Scrucks]] does the same saying she will not mourn for her nation like her cousin. [[Tevkosh Adelka]] stands next, joining too. Eventually, about 90 delegates stand and join as well, including high ranking members from both sides.

The whole vote must be re-cast, eventually we learn that the new [[The Circle]], will have 2 from [[The Providers]], 2 from [[The Guardians]], and 1 from [[The Listeners]]. We will have to see who this becomes, but we hear [[Victor]] and [[Henrik]] both being heavily debated. 

In the same box, [[Costi]] looks over at [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], who always appears exactly as he wants, but as [[Henrik]] stands to talk, there's a brief flash of surprise. He covers immediately, but we know. He politics for a while, but then stops by [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] inviting us to a political reception tonight at [[Chapel of the Lost]]. We trade barbs, until [[Giary]] pops in, introducing himself, insulting [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], and then saying he'll be at the party all in one fell swoop. 

[[Giary]] tells us that [[Terrav]] and [[Zephyra]] had an intense fight, but all ended up okay after killing a bunch of [[Fire Raisers]]. 

We go to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s party, and everyone is there. There's even more blue visible than there was earlier, who have set up a listening session for the public. He's rented the whole ground floor of the [[Chapel of the Lost]]. [[Welcome]] is there, and she slips [[Jade]] a room key. We speak to many people, including finally being introduced to [[Del Scrucks]]. We also speak to [[Henrik]] briefly, who when we hint at the surprise, says "I don't know what came over me". He says he'll grab us in an hour or two, and we can chat privately. 

[[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] pulls [[Rez]] aside at one point, saying that he's aware that [[The Hunter]] is no longer here so he will now continue the hunt outside. He's curious about how this new political movement will affect [[Arkhosia]]'s place within the [[Southern Cities]]. As he goes, he pulls [[Rez]] into a hug and says, "I know what you did. I cannot prove it. But I promise you, I will either see you in chains or spit you like the pig you are". Then covers with an ask for her to let him know next she's in [[Zalev]], she parts with "Good luck with that" and a wink.

[[Tevkosh Adelka]] introduces himself to [[Costi]]. He asks for lunch or dinner to speak further. [[Hugh]] introduces himself, and they agree to meet. [[Pruvki Forgaveat]] nods in confirmation. 

At the end of the night [[Henrik]] pulls us into a back room, and loses a bit of his new political persona. We ask why he's done this, and he says he genuinely felt compelled to make a change. We don't know him very well, he's lived a life of extremes. He's from [[Mulfara]], and knows what having both nothing and everything is like. He's smart enough to fear retribution from [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], but will try to give him enough and act like he's still under his finger. We ask how he knew there'd be an empty seat, and he says they must've been funded by some really deep pockets. He moved some of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s money around, but was always assured someone reasonable was in charge. He claims he knows of [[Victor]] but was never involved. [[Freya]] asks about some compensation, including a lifetime flyteway pass, and he says if he'll be on the [[The Circle]], he'll make it happen. [[Costi]] threatens him slightly, saying that we won't clean up his mess always and he put a lot of the city at risk. He says if we do get [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back, it's clear we're buying up all of the diamonds we can get, to let him know. We ask for help, he says he'll try to have money or diamonds fall off the back of the truck.

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] publicly thanks us at the end of the party, and extends an open invitation to visit him whenever we'd like. 

[[Niko]] tells us to speak to [[Ravona Drakness]], and she has a letter for us which reads, "I thought you'd find this here Costi. I know I should face accountability for what I've done, that the right thing to do is to turn myself in and face teh consequences. but i could not. there "

[[Giary]] [[Terrav]] and [[Zephyra]] all independently feel compelled to find him, and decide to set off together.

[[Jade]] receives a dream, from [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]. She remembers her immediately from the blood magic. She congratulates us on what we've done, the [[The Silver Halves]] will be in [[Arkhosia (City)]] in two-ish months but they can give us a ride after that. She asks [[Jade]] to tell [[Rez]] to tell [[Vask]] to stop trying to start international-events to stop them and do something as cool as [[Rez]]. 

[[Freya]] sendings to [[Naya]], that it needs to be soon, things are maybe rotting, and she wants to bring [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. 

We have two months to do whatever we'd like, we can each get a reward, any conversations we want to have send to joe, we'll pick up with [[The Silver Halves]] getting into town.
