# Detailed Notes: Session 57

We leave the caverns after all of 15 minutes, and decide to go report to [[Vorhmen]]. He asks politely if we can go clean ourselves off before tracking all the spider goo around his house. Aftwe we're done, he invites us all in for dinner. [[Costi]] assumes he's the Mayor becuase he has a large table, [[Vorhmen]] explains that's not exactly how it works around here. [[Jade]] reorients us and we tell him all about our spider-squishing tales. He pays us 125gp, and tests [[Freya]] to see if she's honest by asking what we had agreed on before he pays. She passes the test, and then asks if there's a previous [[Wayfinders]] he had a bad experience with, and he said to watch out for someone named [[Free Rider]].

We learn a bit more about [[Vorhmen]]'s background, he served in the [[Arkhosian Military]] in [[Mulfara]] with the 2nd division, led by [[Wyhdoi Ped]], but retired 28 years ago. He says that family has run the 2nd division for years. [[Hugh]] mentions that he also served in the [[Eberronian Military]]. [[Costi]] asks if he knows [[Victor]], he says by reputation only. After learning that we met in [[Tinzelven]], he said it was often a spot for veterans to go, that [[Victor]] helps them get reintegrated. [[Rez]] asks about bandits, and he says we're far from the law out here but there are often groups that come through who make him undersell his vegetables. We ask if he knew [[Trent]], and he does not. 

[[Costi]] talks to him about the [[Arkhosian Elections]], and [[Vorhmen]] says riders come through with pamphlets who share the platforms of the political parties. He generally believes people should not have their vote tied to land ownership. He makes a joke about Firebrands and [[Rez]] plays clueless to see what the rumors are about the [[Fire Raisers]] - he says they're imminent rebels and he thinks violence happened in [[Jalantar]] and [[Arkhosia (City)]] and more should be coming. He also warns about pickpockets in the lower city. 

[[Vorhmen]] also asks if we can bring a note to his supplier, [[Uhndoor Aleeli]], telling him his crop yield will be down by about 17% due to the spider damage. His office is in [[Sciorca Clutch]]. We also talk a bit more about the cave, and if the tunnels ran to or away from the hamlet. [[Costi]] sends a magical eye down to look at our damage, and [[Vorhmen]] asks us to deliver another note to one of his military buddies who's now a town guard to maybe send out some folks - his name is [[Zhuvermin]]. 

As we go out to bed, [[Hugh]] shares that he had a memory - a long time ago he fought someone who had a similar sword to [[Vorhmen]]'s but the markings looked less sleek and new. [[Hugh]] realized he might be more than 2 years old. 

We wake up and know we're about 7 hours away from [[Arkhosia (City)]] and get on the road. We see a few more folks on the road, increasing as we get nearer, about an hour away we see the [[Arkohsia City Sunspot]] and enter. It's larger and busier than the [[Jalantar Sunspot]], and a brown and white feathered aarakocra greets us. We tell hrer it was found with the wyverns. We give her the sword with the holy symbol of [[Pelor]], and learn her name is [[Mother Dendee]]. [[Freya]] overhears some travelers talking about how nice it was to find a bandit trap abandonded. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] talks about our plan and [[Hugh]] sendings to [[Srictha]] to ask about updates and if he knows [[Khequii]], he says "You okay? Yea I know Khequii, associate, not well. Close to city? Tell me where you're staying". We change up our order of operations a little, and discuss the need to lay low at first. 

Eventually we get to the [[Arkhosia Guards]] on the outside of the city, who notes that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is tied to us and that's a big deal (thanks to [[Costi]]'s detect thoughts). We say we're here for the [[Arkhosian Elections]] and give them the letter from [[Ellinev Del]] and [[Victor]], which is passed on to a more senior guard [[Dfana]]. She tells us they've been waiting for us and pulls us to a separate line. She asks us to wait in a separate room while they're working on a few details, we're volun-told to wait. As we walk, she asks another guard named [[Lalo]] to bring along 10 backup and we give them the note from [[Vorhmen]] for [[Zhuvermin]]. We also give [[Dfana]] the bandit cipher of crimes.

[[Hugh]] and [[Giary]] see their first glimpse of the ocean from the balcony. After a sweet moment about [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]] promising to bring [[Hugh]] here, and [[Costi]] saying he sort of did - we learn that the earth is flat. [[Jade]] says the ocean feed directly into the [[Elemental Plane of Water]]. We all debate. 

[[Dfana]] comes back and tells us we were cleared, but the [[Terrorist Activity Investigation  Committee]] wants to talk to us as soon as we free. [[Rez]] asks why, she says it's run by [[Ellinev Del]] and [[Victor]] in the [[Suncrest Palace]], which is the seat of government is and where the [[Arkhosian Elections]] delegates will be staying. They say they can send us straight there on a flyteway. [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] has sent a delegate, it's [[Henrik]], and he wants to talk to us first. She recommends we stay in [[The Claw]], centrally located but pricer, or [[the clutch]]. 

[[Henrik]] enters, and we tell him briefly about our trip, by which we tell him nothing new. He reintroduces himself to [[Giary]] and [[Jade]]. He says he'll store [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] harp, seperately from [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. He's procured rooms for us at the [[Chapel of the Lost]], which is now a very nice hotel remodeled from the Temple to [[Kelemvor]]. He says as soon as we're done with the [[TAI Committee]] we should go speak to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. We all talk for a minute about if we hate [[Henrik]] now or not. [[Rez]] tried to give him a bit of encouragement for being nice, he told her to make sure [[Giary]] drinks the wine. Turns it out it was gently poisoned. Now he can't go meet [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], so sorry but thanks?

We friendship-bomb [[Dfana]] and convince her to meet us for drinks later. Eventually, with a bit of confusion, she relents. We get our first ride on the flyteway, and it's gorgeous. [[Freya]] tries getting us all to agree to some ground rules, but the messages land with mixed success. 

We arrive at the [[Suncrest Palace]] and are escorted to [[Ellinev Del]] and [[Victor]] through a bunch of back passages, escorted by a fairly large number of guards, including the very grumpy, not a fan of us, [[First Officer Ghent]]. [[Ellinev Del]] asks us to give a step by step recounting of our trip. It was a lot, and we skipped anything to do with [[Ulia Glorsbade]]. She interogates us closely, and seems to be a bit reserved from our answers. She's definitely getting suspicious. [[Freya]] tried to read her, and she is decidedly colder after our conversation than when we entered. [[Rez]] chimes in to get [[Victor]]'s attention, and asks about the parties we were going to attend together, he says he'll get dinner with [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] and introduce [[Costi]] to a few people. 

We head towards the [[Chapel of the Lost]], and [[Freya]] investigated the cables of the Flyteway. It appears similar to the fuse [[Ulia Glorsbade]] made, but is actually pure adamantine. We get escorted to our rooms. We each have our own suites, complete with a sitting area, three bedrooms, and two restrooms. We find listening stones planted on us, in [[Freya]]'s gruung jacket, in some of [[Costi]]'s pants, and hidden in bags we'd normally wear for [[Rez]], [[Hugh]], and [[Jade]]. [[Henrik]] is in the room next to us, and was surprised how quickly our interview with [[Ellinev Del]] and [[Victor]] went, and [[Rez]] lies to say everything went well. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Ellinev Del]] to try and smooth things over - "There's more to the story. We've learned of Fire Raiser plans but don't know enough. Guards might be involved, couldn't talk. Give time and trust!" She responds - "Trust is slowly earned and quickly broken. We will find time to talk in two days. Please have a truthful account prepared. Confirm appointment tomorrow."

[[Hugh]] sendings to [[Srictha]] telling him where we're staying and to pick a place nearby to meet, he asks to ping him tomorrow for a place. [[Henrik]] comes to get us to meet with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. He tells us we have work to do: before the end of next week, he needs us to recover - and just by telling us we're bound for secrecy sake. From the crypt of Eepings in the [[Halls of the Dead]]. They're an old family from [[Arkhosia (City)]], they have a family tradition of being buried with important items. [[Sheske Eeping]] was buried with a mirror he would like to have. It is "helpful to make a gentleman look his best before the elections". He says the lower levels of the crypt has dangers, and when [[Jade]] tries to ask him questions he threatens his dipleasure over it breaking is the biggest danger we should be worried about. There's a smaller handmirror, that should also be in that crypt, he wants too. We should expect protections from grave robbers, so we should be on the lookout. 

The [[Halls of the Dead]] is open to visit by appointment, you just have to make a sizeable donation. We try and get any more useful information from him but he mainly tells us to figure it out. 

[[Jade]] asks about the exploding buildings, he says it's been about 28 thus far and accelerating in the last week. Centered on [[The Claw]] and [[Sciorca's Clutch|the clutch]], with one on the gilded way. Two [[The Providers]] hangouts, one [[The Guardians]] office, and admin building for manufacturing work, seven hotels, and more. There's been two casulaties they know of, but [[Henrik]] can tell us more.
