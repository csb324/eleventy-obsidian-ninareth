# Session 160

We sneak our way through the tunnels, [[Rez]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] take potions of necrotic resistance as we approach a large steel door at seemingly the end of the tunnel. The rest of our party moves back, and [[Freya]] opens the door - it wasn't trapped, but illusioned on the other side. 

We see a small room with large canals of green acidic liquid with a strong smell. Four figures are in the room, 3 in the personal guard of [[Duchess v'Dharinov]], tending to a huge plant in the center of the room with a horrific scent. [[Hugh|Finn]] notices this is, at the very least similar, of [[Burston Courtev]]'s monster's green ooze. 

In a very disturbing scene, [[Rez]] convinces the last man standing we're on his side and he needs to help us help [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. It works, he tells us the little he knows about the map, and says the person he says the one who might know where the saferoom is [[Captain Onyx]]. [[Freya]] offers to carry him across the burning acid/poison, and then drops him. 

We cross through a hallway, one side a concerningly happy humming is coming, so we leave that the fuck alone. Another room is filled with 16 recently killed prisoners. 

The next room out is lavish, filled with cushions and fine clothing, with baths and makeup. The 'preparation room', so that those who do their monstrous work here are not ugly or messy, or that anyone she might interact with are clean. 

We follow our directions, along with our own deductive skills, as far as we can - before finding a long hallway and two nearby doors. We open a door with a silent room first, it's a picked over armory. A couple hundred weapons and armor seems to have been taken recently. It seems like more ranged weapons were taken than melee, though more short than long swords. 

We backtrack into the main hallway, to check out the writing noise. [[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] find a corporal of the [[Eberronian First Division]] who 'just mans the cages'. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] holds him, and [[Freya]] just mutilates him. [[Hugh|Finn]] takes his sending stone, [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] investigates his office. We find an execution order, for all civilian and military captives - signed by [[Jehneim Bastienev]]. Cage one, was completed, which is where we were. Cage two is underway. 

There's another door in the room that leads to a doorless L hallway, it feels strange so we go that way. We are too loud, and a young teen porter hears us. He sprints away before we are able to do anything, as he skids around into a storage room. We don't see him, [[Rez]] tries to message to him but he doesn't buy it. [[Costi]] finds a stone that is askew, inside are 15 people. Several seem to be those that have worked in the torture chambers, some personal staff, and chefs. It is clearly a saferoom for staff. We learn that [[Captain Onyx]] is in the barracks room across the hall. One skeezy one volunteers (to save himself) that there are secrets to opening the hidden walls. We momentarily debate how to do it, before deciding [[Freya]] would throw in a bomb. [[Costi]], as he leaves, says "if you have a god, make peace with them now". 

As we close the secret door to allow the blast, it seals perfectly. The teen porter shows us how to open it. He tries to bargain, but [[Freya]] leans in to "tell him a secret - gods are real", and kills him, then fucks up his jaw so he can't tell things in death. 

[[Rez]] messages to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "It seems like there's more to this than you may have told us, it better be worth it.", she replies, "together, we have to make it worth it".

After a brief collective hallucination of Rez bursting in naked as a tribute to the Duchess needing an escort, we stick with reality and plan to say [[Jehneim Bastienev]] told us to find him for an escort to the Duchess.

We enter into the Barracks, 6 legit guards are in there, but they're not initially shocked to see people enter, as though they were waiting for someone, but ARE surprised when they see it's us. 

[[Captain Onyx]] is a drow. He recognizes us immediately. He's also a huge shit. We notice that their eyes twitch subconsciously to the floor by the pillar. The fight was inevitable, and [[Hugh|Finn]] is the one to start it, leaning into violence in a new way for [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. [[Rez]] does a new trick animating the coffin desk. Luck breaks our way and the fight works better than we feared, killing everyone in the room. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is able to intimidate the lone survivor into surrendering and saying they were waiting the arrival of a new major, [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]], who was supposed to join the personal guard for [[Duchess v'Dharinov]]. 

When [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] if she knew that was happening, she said it was news to her, but makes it clear the witness rule applies to him. We tell her our validator will be in a barrel. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] death wards [[Costi]], then casts beacon of hope, we tie up this guard and then stuff him in a barrel to hide him. 

[[Costi]], meanwhile, naturally finds the entrance to the [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] lair. 

As soon as we are about to go down, [[Major Stradvarth Coldseeker]] arrives with a retinue of guards, including [[Marius A]]. [[Rez]] immediately is able to convince him the [[ELA]] are attacking, we saw them go down, and we have no time to spare. He opens the secret entrance.

[[Marius A]] comes to [[Costi]], who says nothing other than he has to trust him, and says you have to trust me -- no matter what. 

[[Rez]] hears in her head, "well well well, you five are busy little bees. I might pay you a visit" from [[Colvia Ghul]], [[Rez]] replies, "We're nothing if not full of secrets! Pay us a visit now...? Now is helpful, I'm much less interesting dead. Plus, Bastinev has it coming."

As we walk out [[Freya]] kills that guy, as [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tells [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], [[Marius A]] is our witness now. 

In the secret chamber, [[Duchess v'Dharinov]] sits on a obsidian throne, [[Jehneim Bastienev]] is communicating through papers, saying, "I hate when [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] is right" and [[Colvia Ghul]] bursts into existence right as we enter. Suspended from the ceiling, are 5 humanoids with rubies embedded into their foreheads.
