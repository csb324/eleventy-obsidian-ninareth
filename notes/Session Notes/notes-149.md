# Detailed Notes: Session 149

[[Colvia Ghul]] ushers us into a room she uses for interrogations. it's been 'interesting' since we left, but it seems like there's been an increase in [[ELA]] activity, and maybe some more work for [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]. She'll let the Chamberlain, [[Jehneim Bastienev]] tell us more. 

We agree to tell her information in exchange for 'friendship' and no more threats or exchanges. She 'apologizes' for the heavy-handedness but says with our reputations she thought it was necessary.

[[Freya]] starts and covers:
* She first saw the symbol when she left Polaris and has been looking for information since. It's been difficult finding additional information.
		- We found the symbol in a book in the margins - The Unnatural Naturality, and [[Drimbias Shaziros]] autobiography
		- Book shop in [[Thelran Asari]]
- Eye in the middle of the symbol, it's called [[Freya's Mysterious Circles|Eye of the Everpresent]] (this causes [[Colvia Ghul]]'s pupils to dilate)
- That it's tied to [[Morthos]], who may or may not be a dead guy, but also it's maybe [[Morthos|M]] - someone previously had a goal to supplant [[Vecna]] 
- [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]] 
- The tree in [[Dilandil]], [[Resurrect Adrienne]], and [[Willow]] - he maybe insane but it seems that gods are involved
- Some of [[Jade]]'s nonsense scribbling 

She asks some follow ups
* What else was on [[Freya's Mysterious Letter]], "don't trust anybody else that you love", which turned out to be true, "we're watching, come find me" - does say it has the [[Wayfinders]] symbol on it
* Are all of our gods involved, [[Freya]] says she doesn't, but [[Colvia Ghul]] says she's a [[Wayfinders]], which is tied to [[Pelor]]. [[Rez]] says [[Bahamut]] is involved, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] says [[Corellon Larethian]] certainly is. [[Hugh|Finn]] says it's unclear [[The Raven Queen]] and [[TrueSilver]]'s involvement
* Is there anything we've forgotten we'd like to add? We talk about the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]], arguing about which gods are included: [[The Raven Queen]], [[Vecna]], and another who could've been [[Morthos]], [[Kelemvor]], or [[Loviatar]] 
* Is there anything we're intentionally not telling her? Yep. We want to live. 

[[Colvia Ghul]] asks if [[Freya]] will be speaking at the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]], [[Colvia Ghul]] typically likes to go. We'll get dinner. [[Colvia Ghul]] also says she'd like to meet [[Jade]], and keeps one of her notes. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] pivots us to how we'll work together in the future. She thinks working together could be beneficial, we've stumbled onto something quite interesting. And while she'll keep pursuing it, she thinks this is "our secret". She thinks it's best that we continue our efforts unhindered - and whatever she can do to help, let her know.

As she leaves, we notice that she's got thin fine lines of gold embedded into her skin. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] notes that the statues in the room had a strong undead presence. 

We're escorted [[Klodec Hyemagu]] and [[Jehneim Bastienev]]. We tell about our [[Zhakastin Expedition]] and that we destroyed an undead named [[Zormvrik]]. Some of the undead would come back after being destroyed, it seems like they were working on efforts and repeating reanimation. 

They ask if we have any of the items that were used to conduct the experiments, and asked us to give them any of the ones that we took with us. 

We finish by saying the undead we freed led us to this portal of undeath, and we were able to dispel it and it disappeared. She seems skeptical but [[Costi]] is able to pick a future where she more readily believes us. 

[[Jehneim Bastienev]] asks for the evidence of what we're saying, [[Rez]] is able to pull off a deflection that we were supposed to infiltrate NOT risk exposure by taking evidence. She buys it, but with so much aggravation. 

They offer a map and ask us to make notes of where we saw things. Also to make a forgery of what we saw. We give her the oak, birch, iron [[necromantic spikes]] and say we'll give the rest (with the successful one noted) by the end of the day. 

Despite her annoyance, they pays us well.

We're offered better accommodations in the meantime, a recently forfeited house in the commerce district from [[ELA]] sympathizers. 

[[Jehneim Bastienev]] shares there was a bit of an incident in the city, in recent months, but she says it's escalating into dangerous territory. There are a series of catacombs under the storm wall, we shouldn't worry about what happens there, but beneath them are vaults that house a number of dangerous creatures. They believe some within the [[ELA]] might be planning to tamper within them. It doesn't seem imminent, within a few weeks, but they ask that we could be sure the attempt fails once it begins. 

They can give us more information once they determine what they can declassify. We should kill the beasts before they reach the surface. Moreover, they worry some within the [[Jezeten]] elite might be harboring pro-[[ELA]] beliefs. These elite would have access to more knowledge that they have not been able to account for. 

We are taken to the home in the commerce district. There is furniture, but all art is removed, and everything her is new. [[Costi]] gazes through the house to try to find hidden areas. We do find a 'hidden' basement but there's literally nothing here. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] sends to [[Elena]], "who lives at (current address) we were “given” a home to stay during our remaining stay", she responds, "The [[Vebrovga]] family, they went missing last week. Take good care of it."

We spend some time with the [[necromantic spikes]]. There's no religious tenor to any of them, the ones that worked seemed to have the most clear runes. The runes are not identical on all of them. We fuck up the ones that worked some, with the new cover story of [[Freya]] originally taking them out of the wall with her axe. 

[[Rez]] sending to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "Quick q! Chamberlin wants spikes from undead experiments. OBVS don't want to give ideas for recreating. Can we get away with withholding the successful one?", she replies, "Lying to the chamberlain is incredibly dangerous. If you choose to do it, ensure that you can’t be found out."

We talk about if there's anyway to obscure the information, process, or replicability more. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] writes out an addendum to our report, we also forgot about this guy [[Turgyd]], who told us about the caches, and that where we got the weapons. Also how to open the desks, we don't think we left notes, but maybe they can learn more. It's so unbelievably convincing. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] has the breakthrough on our final puzzle on the book. [[Oghma]] is tied into this. We also note: 
* on page 154 - the 1 is scribbled out AND 345 - the 5 is scribbled out -- the year 3454 is 2 years away
* Throughout the book, "keep" and "her" are together many times, alluding to "Keeper" 
* There are some notes that we can trust [[Akros]] but not [[Gulsindip Desindever|Superior Desindever]]
* Page 221 - "seems like a handy hiding place" we should check behind some portrait somewhere
* [[Polaris]] guards something very important, it's fundamental

[[Rawley]] will answer many more questions when we meet in person at the [[Wayfinder Annual Gathering]]. [[Freya]] sends to [[Rawley]], "we did it. Oghma, 3454, keepers are important, dot dot dot… please say this is enough and I don’t have to wait until TA . Now??", he replies, "Proud of you, kid. But we've gotta share this in person. You held out this long, you can make it a few weeks."

[[Freya]] also bugs [[The Curator]] that she needs more information. They do not bite. [[Freya]] sends to [[Dahana]], "Dahana - why is it unwise to check in? I’m keeping my space (when [[Petra]] isn’t coming out of a tree to kill me). Anything new?", she replies, "With the way things ended, there's no such thing as too much space -- for both of us. I wish you well, dear."

4 days to fill

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is out shopping, at some point [[Costi]] is outside of [[Hugh|Finn]]'s focus. Shortly after, he notices a piece of paper in his pocket. It has an address in the O'Ras, "10:30PM tonight". It has no smell, it does look like a girl's writing -- though maybe it looks familiar to her. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sendings to [[Zephyra]], "What are the odds you're in [[Jezeten]] and being cagey as fuck. It's [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. See you tonight, if so" she replies, "The odds are pretty good"
