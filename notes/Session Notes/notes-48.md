# Detailed Notes: Session 48

For recap, see also: [[session-48]]

### Searching for Guidance

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] head to the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. On their way, they see lots of people are heading the [[Central Administrative Cluster]], and give them strange glances. When they arrive, the Hearth is empty, the fires barely lit. 

[[Hugh]] finds a quiet spot, removes his holy symbol and sets it on the hearth. He says, he chose this path because he could not see any more friends die. That he was told he was malfunctioning, and that he doesn't have a soul -- and maybe that's why the revivify didn't work. Perhaps it's memories he doesn't remember that prevent him, but pleas that if he's not good enough he'd like to end this arrangement now. The fire rises and glows in contradiction. 

[[Costi]] tries to interpret that [[Moradin]] doesn't agree, and soothe him. And as he speaks, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp music seems to float through their ears, playing in time with the glow of the hearth. 

"I will never hear my favorite musician play again" "you're hearing her now"

[[Hugh]] puts his holy symbol back on, and [[Costi]] says that's what [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] would've wanted. They settle down, [[Hugh]] staring deeply into the fire, and [[Costi]] polishing his sword -- looking into it's reflection for glimpses of the future where he can fulfill [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s final wishes. A almost perfetly magical (20) glint catches his eye.

When [[Costi]] opens his eyes, and draws the cloth across his sword, for just a moment he sees a flash of an image -- an underground root system, deep under the earth with thick roots running across it. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s harp is in the corner, in excellent condition, and with a blue rose has sprouted from her throat. Looking at [[Hugh]], he saws "I saw what we should do."

### Meanwhile

[[Freya]] and [[Rez]] head to the [[The Tiamat House]], also drawing lots of stares. As we walk, [[Freya]] looks down at the arm that she used the [[Curator Quills]] on, it's lower down on her arm now -- as though part of it dripped out.  As we walk, tells [[The Curator]] she needs to talk to her, they reply that it will have to wait until tonight. Frustrated, [[Freya]] says that she was part of the collection and she should bring her back. [[The Curator]] doesn't respond, only saying they'd come later tonight. [[Freya]] says [[Rez]] may be there.

[[Freya]] immediately turns to give [[Rez]] the update, and while both agree that we need to bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back -- and we CAN, they argue about how. Interpreting [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s words differently, and we don't know how to honor her wishes while still finding a way to bring her back. [[Rez]] is insistent that we don't force her into any more debts that she already had, [[Freya]] says she doesn't want debt if the debt is HARD but Freya could take it and it will be manageable either way. 

As we turn the corner to the [[The Tiamat House]], [[Henrik]] and [[Vask]] are standing at the door way clearly arguging. [[Vask]] comes to meet us and tells us [[Henrik]] came to get them mentioning our message to [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. Trading insults, it's clear that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] means to speak to  [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]]. Noticing how bad we look, he asks if we're okay. [[Rez]] says for fine, but clarifies if he *knows*... he asks if it's true. He pulls us into a group hug, and [[Freya]] picks the two Tanin's up. 

We tearfully break, and [[Freya]] and [[Rez]] make it painfully clear we do NOT care to talk to [[Henrik]] right now, and he can't wait until later. [[Henrik]] asks if he can at least wait inside, bringing a small box with him. Inside are the medals [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] should've been awarded at the [[the Mayor of Jalantar]]'s ceremony. Grabbing [[Rez]]'s wrist, he asks if the news we sent [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is true. She confirms it, and he seems to take the news hard. 

[[Vask]] offers some space to [[Freya]], who rage rooms her feelings out. [[Rez]] and [[Vask]] talk about what happened. She shares that they were taken to [[the Feywild]]. After some mutual exclamations -- [[Rez]] opens up. She's shocked at how quick and senseless it was. That she wasn't worried and then [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was just taken from her. She was so young, and it didn't feel like the kind of deaths that make sense. That these are her people, and no one can else can have them, but she's going to bring her back. [[The Silver Halves]] might be able to help, [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] has a lot of money. [[Rez]] says she's going to reach out to their aunt, [[Vask]] asks if she knows how to get in touch with her, and [[Rez]] says she'll figure it out. She asks [[Vask]] how she can know if she should've done more, he tells her it gets better with time. 

### Back at the Forge

[[Costi]] says that he thinks that he should break up with [[Qik]], or maybe let her break up with him. [[Hugh]] says it's important to share your emotions, and they talk about [[Costi]]'s relationship, or actually lack there of. They decide to head to the [[The Tiamat House]].

### Everyone's at the House

[[Vask]] offers to go tell the rest of [[The Silver Halves]], but about 10 minutes after he leaves [[Qik]] shows up. She wants to know if [[Costi]] is okay, [[Rez]] tells her [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] has died. We all sit in silence with a sad party. Finally [[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] show up, and [[Qik]] immediately pulls him aside. She is shocked by [[Magister]]'s room, and asks just WHO are HIS FRIENDS??

She cuts off his panic to ask if he wants to talk about what happened. Seeing his hesitation, she just lets him sit there. While he's there, she pulls out the dagger [[Costi]] had [[Divitston Goldstone]] design for her. They have an cute but awkward conversation, until [[Costi]] asks if she's ever had someone close to her die - she says yes, when she was really young. He asks how she got over it, and she says the answer sucks - that you don't. Then she breaks up with him. This is all to big and scary for her, even though [[Costi]] is cool and brave and smart. They both seem to agree it's the right choice, even if it's sad. 

[[Henrik]] asks for our report, and says we can expect [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] right before the party. [[Freya]] says we will not get a report, and [[Hugh]] says we do not care what [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] wants. [[Freya]] says "we acheived out goal, we were gone long that we expected, and we lost [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]" he asks us questions, which [[Rez]] begins to answer. We argue over how we're plannign to deal with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] while [[Henrik]] asks more questions. He says [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] has maintained our alibi, that they're working to salvage with the events of today.  We had dinner with [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], and left on his airship, but since we're back and the ship isn't back they have to rework things. 

As he leaves, [[Rez]] messages to him "I know I don't know you, and I might regret this - but if you're anything like [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], she didn't deserve what position she was in and maybe you don't either. So, for her, if you need help - I will help you". [[Henrik]] almost stops, but then keeps going.

As soon as we're alone, [[Hugh]] asks [[Costi]] to tell us about his vision. We all say that we'll go to [[Quaath]], and everyone agrees. [[Rez]] says "[[Arkhosia (City)]] will be fine" which reminds [[Costi]] that oh wait... we've got some obligations. We start to talk about how we're going to do this. We worry if it's going to be too long for it to be successful for [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. [[Freya]] says she has a friend who might help...

### The Curator Reveal

[[Freya]] says she's made a deal, and [[Rez]] owns up too. We discuss where [[The Curator]] has helped [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]], and what our two EQUALLY VALID motivations were for making a deal -- [[Freya]] to try and find a way home, and [[Rez]] because it sounded interesting. [[Costi]] makes the probably fair point that we shouldn't be making independent deals now that we're a party. [[Hugh]] asks why we're bringing it up now? We say it's because we think they can maybe help bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back. [[Costi]] says she didn't want debts, and [[Rez]] AGREES. 

[[Freya]] reminds us that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] didn't know that people could fight for those they care about and she wouldn't know to ask, [[Costi]] says we'll do the hard things but he's worried [[The Curator]] will be like [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] and ask for longterm costs for their help. What has [[The Curator]] has from [[Freya]]? She owns up that it was just a teeny tiny vial of blood for each of her forms. 

A panicked [[Costi]] warns her of all the horrors of blood magic. [[Freya]] asks if we think we could've made it through the [[Threthdia Scrivit]] fight without her help? [[Costi]] doesn't know, but asks at what cost? [[Freya]] says big costs are sometimes needed to do the things we care about. And besides, the deals she makes only have affected her. [[Rez]] corrects her, that we care about what happen to [[Freya]] for her sake too. 

Concerned, [[Rez]] tattles that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] felt the spot on her back was desecrated. [[Costi]] talks about what that means, and [[Freya]] seems a bit concerned for the first time. But maintains that until today she never had a reason to mistrust [[The Curator]]. 

### Here Comes Julian

We all go to clean up while we wait, and come down to [[Magister]], [[Victoria Several|Victoria]], [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], and [[Henrik]]. [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] says they welcomed [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] in, who seems TOTALLY NORMAL the fuck. Seeing our growing rage, [[Magister]] whispers to [[Costi]] "no murders in the house".

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] appears to be grief-striken, and [[Rez]] warns everyone not to mention that we want to bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back. We start to ask what our next steps are, and [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] says that we have to address practical steps - and says we need to address our cover story. He offers to create one for us, but [[Rez]] makes up a plot of [[Threthdia Scrivit]] being jealous of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] and hurting him through killing [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. 

We agree -- [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] was sent out of town to investigate a mill, owned by Tinza Ort, we found a pouch of leaves he gives us. It's full of vigor shade, and extremely toxic root. Were it to be processed into flour, it could be used to hurt more people. He tells us to tell [[Ricci Scrucks]] this, he'll investigate and find more ([[Henrik]] will make sure of that). We're smuggled back into [[Jalantar]], and when we go to talk to [[Threthdia Scrivit]] - she attacked [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and killed her.  She had grown territorial over [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] influence in the arts seen and tried to hurt him through killing [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]].

[[Costi]] pushes back on the repercussions here, but [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] puts him in his place. He confirms that we are expected to give him our assistance for the "rest of the election period" and then we walk away all -- as friends. [[Rez]] clarifies what that means, and he says 32 days. Reluctantly, we all agree. 

Surprised, [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] says he expected more of a fight -- [[Costi]] says we've had enough fighting for today. As a final note, he asks about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s funeral arrangements. We try to keep it private, but [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] makes certain we know he will be making a donation in her honor wherever we pick -- and regardless of what we want. [[Rez]] says we'll let him know. 

[[Costi]] can't stand the dynamic, and pushes [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] one more time as he stands to leave. While cold reassurance, [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] calls [[Costi]]'s insinuations and makes it clear that if we displease him, he'll see us all leave [[Jalantar]] in [[Zalev]] chains. 

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] pretends to have a conversation with [[Henrik]] - "Do you think they'll get to [[Dilandil]] before you do?" "Do you think it would be quicker to take a letter to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s parents and have it delivered to them?"

He then turns to us "you know it's the funniest thing to control someone with debt. a few years back i purchased some debt to [[Branton Spout]]. He could very easily refinance it, it's very overdue. He tells [[Costi]] that he knows [[Costi]] doesn't care, but directly says that he can put [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s parents out of their homes if we displease him. 

He makes it clear that there are several immediate consequences if we don't go forward with this:
* We become fugutives from  [[Zalev]] with documented proof that we did the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]
* [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s parents will have their debt called in
* Veiled threats on the rest of our family

[[Costi]] has an outburst, fearing for the damage we might do and at what point our plan is not worth it. We argue about how far we should go, and how bad this will get. 

### A Reality Check

[[Victoria Several|Victoria]] comes out and warns us that [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] is in a very dangerous situtation and that we need to hide our turmoil and pull it together for everyone's sakes tonight. We tell her we have a lot of to ask her about, and can't keep stepping in it as we try to reign it in: [[Costi]] asking what she did with the [[Weird Boulder]], [[Freya]] revealing that we want to bring [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back, and overhearing our whole argument about [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]].
