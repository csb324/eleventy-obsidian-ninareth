# Detailed Notes: Session 52

For recap, see also: 

[[Freya]] feels better, and follows our trail to find us. Seeing the chaos around us and Costi as a giant ape, they immediately arm wrestle. It's close for a while but [[Costi|Cost-ape]] gets the upper hand and beats her. 

We then talk about what to do with our  [[Costi|Cost-ape]]who will soon be a VERY heavy rock. While chatting we investigate the room and also carve up the monsters for parts, getting too many roper teeth and a gorgon sac. 

Moving on, we find a door at the end of the hallway. [[Jade]] investigates it and see's wires attached to the door. [[Hugh]] offers to use thamaturgy to open the door and trigger the trap, and  [[Costi|Cost-ape]]shields him. Good thing too, as the door open engulfs the entire halfway into flames. Our primate friend gets a bit singed, but the rest of us hide out behind it and make okay. 

Walking through, we see a wall that appears to be unhewn rock. [[Jade]] and [[Hugh]] investigate with [[ [[Costi|Cost-ape]]punches the walls, testing their strength. [[Jade]] spots a spot in the wall that is the outline of a door, and [[Giary]] and [[Costi|Cost-ape]] punch it down. As we step the next room, [[Giary]], [[Hugh]], [[Rez]] are hoisted up into the air by a snare while [[Jade]] and [[Freya]] are held. 

The lights turn on and we see five figures. One, concentrating on [[Jade]], three with long rifles trained at us, and [[Ulia Glorsbade]] ready to kill us.  [[Rez]] tries to remind her who we are, and while it takes her a moment to remember she immediately believes the [[Fire Raisers]] sent us to kill her. We just say we're trying to talk to her.

Grudginly, she agrees to talk, but places bombs around us as a precaution to kill us if we attack. [[Rez]] says we've been asked by many people to be involved, but [[Ulia Glorsbade]]'s response was to stay far away. She says she doesn't know who was pulling the strings, but that she mostly talked to [[Winifey]] - though she had a letter from [[Cinder]]. We explained why there was a [[Costi|Cost-ape]] instead of [[Costi]] and she's quite upset, says she placed it there for her protection. One of the halfings with her was named Fluhar, but he's the one who leaves goodbarrel bottle caps around.

She says that she's seen organizations fall apart for less than what's happeneing at the [[Fire Raisers]], and thinks they want to kill her. We say we only know they want her in for questioning, but they lie a lot. We explain that we've been loosely involved with a bunch of organizations all with different motives. We share that [[Winifey]] told us to look for her here, and she says [[Winifey]] told her to crash at [[Fort Chyvasti]]. We say we want to be sure [[Fire Raisers]] are doing the right thing but we're having a hard time knowing who wants want. She also talked to [[Srictha]] but not a lot. 

With some cajoling by [[Rez]] she shares that the [[Fire Raisers]] are working on something big, [[Ulia Glorsbade]] made them a fuses - 8 of them, about 300 feet long each - but she expects they're working with many people. She made a fuse that allows for it to go off at a highly-specific time and is very hard to mess with. The fuse itself is metal. It won't cut but it burns. 

She says if the [[Fire Raisers]] kill her, it'll upset the [[Goodbarrels]] but with the work she's done a fanatical might not care. She says she's never learned how to interfere with the fuse, it's the whole selling point. She says the [[Goodbarrels]] will contract out to anyone for the right price. If someone wants to purchase her fuses, you ask the [[Goodbarrels]] Cask of their 2142.

She was upset that we ruined their way out of here. They were going to be transported as statues, but we offer her the Gorgon petrification sac. She takes it, and says it'll be enough to turn her. She has cream to turn them all, but since there's not enough to turn everyone into rock she offers to sell it to us. [[Hugh]] and [[Freya]] each give 200gp to get some cream for [[Costi]], [[Rez]] tries to buy another one but says it would be 600. She says theirs diamonds in there. 

[[Ulia Glorsbade]] is not finishing her contract, she was supposed to go to [[Arkhosia (City)]] and meet a revolutionary aarakokcra named [[Khequi]] who works at a pottery shop in [[Driftrock]] call [[Kindness Kiln]], he was going to give her his next job. They also gave her a hideout hub, a bar called [[Flyte]] in the [[Irralsil Spire]] (which means first quarter in Draconic). She says [[Winifey]] also let slip that they couldn't do anything until the [[Cloud's Lament]] docked. 

We wrap up the conversation, and she says she hopes to never see us again, but we end on a good note. We make our way out of [[Fort Chyvasti]]. As [[Costi|Cost-ape]] and [[Giary]] arm wrestle, [[Giary]] turns him into a stone. [[Hugh]] and [[Rez]] rub the diamond paste over him, and after a few minutes he returns to tell us being a statue was nothingness - which we discuss some. 

[[Freya]] then asks if there's multiple secret crime orgs, [[Giary]] mentions knowing a group called the [[Fishermen]], who works mostly out of the peer and the quay in [[Arkhosia (City)]]. [[Jade]] asks [[Giary]] about [[Niko]], and he says he's trying to stop him from doing something he can't come back from. We try and see if he talked about or met with any [[Fire Raisers]] but he said not that he knew. 

As we get back on the road, [[Freya]] pulls out her book [[Kith and Kin]] from [[Akros]] and [[Rawley]] and asks some questions - asks [[Rez]] why she likes copper so much, if we've heard of Ashwalkers ([[Jade]] says seems like zombies), or the Dreamweavers (doesn't ring a bell). [[Costi]] says he's read the novel too, it's like a pulpy fiction novel. [[Costi's mom]] recommended it, and we go off. As we make camp for the night, [[Hugh]] sendings to her. He asked if there was any reason he should read it, she says she liked it growing up and will try to remember who recommended it to her.

We settle around the campfire and [[Jade]] tries to catch up on [[Costi]] and [[Hugh]]'s goals, so we recap the story thus far regarding [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]. [[Costi]] doesn't know really anything about [[ELA]], but [[Jade]] has heard of them and their anti-[[Eberron]]ian work. After some additional chat, [[Hugh]] asks her for a [[ELA]] POC in [[Arkhosia (City)]], and she says she'll have more information tomorrow night. 

"Hello wife. concerned about safety for elections in arcosia city. Do you know [[ELA]] contact in city? Need to pass information. Hello to [[Nadia]] from us"

We also discuss our views on [[Niko]] and what we think we'll do. We are uncertain about our ability to rehabilitate him, but would like that option before killing him. [[Giary]] asks if it gets to it that we just beat him up and put him in a box. 

After some additional chatting, [[Rez]] messes with her new ability and tries to make a version of that fuse [[Ulia Glorsbade]] designed. We find out that she can make a nonmagical version, which is a tough metal very resistant to hitting but burns super quickly, and seems to be very expensive since she can only make a very small amount of it.
