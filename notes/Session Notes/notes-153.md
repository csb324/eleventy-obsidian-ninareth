# Detailed Notes: Session 153

We head to unit 407 in the [[Stormwall district]], the neighborhood is desolate. 

[[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] debate if we should warn [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]], but ultimately decide against it based on our previous conversations. [[Costi]] prays to [[The Raven Queen]], and feels a super strong unholy presence underneath us. That tracks. 

We remember, bite, weakening you after sucking blood, regenerate unless they are hit with sunlight or holy water or in a lot of running water. [[Hugh|Finn]] has enough for 5 uses. We remember they aren't as effected by necrotic or poison, but are typically a bit more beast like. 

On the way, [[Freya]] notes that the main roads are almost only used by military forces, and locals use the side roads to stay hidden. [[Hugh|Finn]] notes that many of the windows are blocked off or covered by dark curtains. Anyone we clock peeking through them immediately hides, there's fear present but not sure why. Most buildings have two [[Eberronian First Division]] guards attending outside. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] does not detect any undead presence however. 

After a short walk, we realize we're being followed, a group of guards that seem to grow in number as we progress. As we continue, we approach two collided carts. A Corporal Doorman, plus a group of about 15 people, try to say we are on official business but they really don't believe us. We really try to let him know who are, but they're idiots and don't listen - even as we name ourselves the heroes of [[Golstrava]]. 

[[Freya]] sends, "Hi [[Jehneim Bastienev]], working on your project Doorman, first, trying to extort" but is counterspelled before she can continue. They then push [[Hugh|Finn]], but only bounce back themselves. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] tries very hard to convince them to leave. We fuck up a few of them, the rest of them run away. [[Rez]] goes momentarily feral when [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is knocked unconscious, telling Doorman not to touch her then psychically destroys him. We pile the bodies up in the carts they barricaded the street with. 

Bear barbarian, knocked Adrienne unconscious. Rez “Don’t touch her” and psychic lance, 30 points psychic, while incapcitated, sorcerous burst, nat 20, rolled 2 8s, so kept adding dice, 50 points total for 100 damage on him, ON A CANTRIP

As soon as the fight ends, [[Costi]] sends [[Samuel]] into one of the nearby buildings (unit 326). He has [[Samuel]] knock, inside is an empty mess hall. Next door is an empty office. He finds a janitor, bribes him with Doorman's gold, then keeps exploring. Inside are locked groups of people, many put into one room, pale. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Jehneim Bastienev]] to CYA "Delayed by dumb insubordinate group of First Division guards - Corp. Doorman and crew. Tried to deescalate, they didn't listen. Three dead, convinced others to flee." She replies, "**Sigh** Understood, we'll handle it. My very sincere apologies"

It's an 8 story tall building, one of the largest we've seen in the area. Inside, there are multiple of these dorms, filled with more gaunt pale people packed into bunks. It seems like there's maybe some dead space that is unclear on it's use between these rooms. As [[Samuel]] is scouting, he panics and is suddenly taken out. We decide we should go investigate.

As we reach the next floor up, part of our group notices a vent close as soon as we enter the hallway. Whatever killed [[Samuel]] went into the vents. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] does not disconnect 

i'm not going to hurt you, that's what they always say, what's happeneing here, you're one of them feed her one of who if you're going to eat, jsut eat, no fangs, you're one of them. who are we? we're here to kill some, of the vampires, did [[Keth]] send you? He lives her, we were hoping to talk to him. If we come back, tell them "[[Nebril]] sent you."

It's clear this is some humanoid farm for blood. 

Seems like there's a new type of undead that feeds on energy, or positive emotions. None of us know about that. 

We reach the entrance to the catacombs, and are immediately hit by an extremely strong odor of death. Approaching a large steel door with two stone statues on either sides, leading down, we see dozens of cages - most are empty, three have corpses, one drained completely, one bloated swollen and damp. It's super notable that these stone statues aren't mentioned at all. 

Creating a plan using [[Costi]]'s wall of force, half of us are surprised by a gas of slow that leaks from them and effecting [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] but it doesn't matter because we easily block them out. 

Once inside, it seems like the catacombs themselves are magically created out of a perfect black stone that almost seems to absorb light. Sound also bounces off the walls intentionally. 

As we move through, we've found that some of the traps have been recently activated - one pinning a dead half-elf with nondescript clothes to the wall. However, we don't see any of the sensor that the Chamberlain told us exist, we assume they must be invisible. 

We're hit by an acrid smell of smoke. Using our standard order, we proceed deeper into the tunnels. One side of the hallway has been blasted apart, showing into that side of the room, on the other side of the hall there's a door ajar. Both of them look like small containment rooms, dead ends. A number of bodies seem caught in the blast, three well dressed pale still figures with red eyes, and another humanoid in the thieves leathers along with a drained corpse. [[Costi]] is able to determine this blast must've been a mix of magic and mundane. This room originally had 8 bedrolls. 

The other side of the hallway has a door still open. Inside, are four subrooms with dividers between them, each small area decorated a little differently, with four beds. Maybe these are four energy vampires? It appears as though they were left in a hurry. Searching them, we find a beautiful ring embedded with sapphires and a locket. Underneath one of the mattresses is a few pages of prose regarding coming into his newly given abilities, signed [[Wenric T.]]. Every 18 days he was able to 'experiment' with someone new, in particular he says his mimicry has been improving. He gloats he was finally pulling past the gnome [[Sapos Strongflight]]. The other two names are [[Carris Willowshadow]], an elf, and [[Benrigg]], a dwarf. [[Wenric T.]] is also experimenting with telekinetic abilities. 

Further ahead, another bomb has clearly gone off as well. There's a large black dent and soot mark against the wall, about the size of a beach ball, fresh smoke along it -- gore and viscera in a 15ft cone around the area. Trying to determine how many creatures this was, we think at least a couple. There's several pale limbs, but it's hard to know how much blood is in one vampire spawn. We think this ultimately looks like 4 of their regular spawn have died. Our mental math makes us think we're still looking out for one regular and four emotional vampires. 

As we walk down the hallway, a pale body is thrown onto [[Rez]] as she's pulled back at knife point into [[Marius Lupu]]. After verifying [[Costi]] is who he says he is, they happily reunite. He's hurt, but seems enthused to find us and says we can still finish the mission. He pulls out 3 more bombs. He's using traps to lure the smart spawn away. He blames this all on [[Yasden]] using the wrong command word: one makes the bombs invisible, the other makes it detonate. 

[[Costi]] breaks the news that we need to kill these vampires, and take the bombs. [[Marius Lupu]] argues that he has own mission, and tries to convince us to let him go do it. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] offers to have us split up to and place the bombs, he seems to buy it - though pushes us to hunt down the 5 remaining vampires. We defer the conversation, saying we can all agree to go hunt some vampires.
