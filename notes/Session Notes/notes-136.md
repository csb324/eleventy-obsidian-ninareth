# Detailed Notes: Session 136

We help [[Costi]] work on breaking the rest of the code from [[Burston Courtev]]'s notes. They say that [[Burston Courtev]] worked with [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] and [[Salid]] in [[New Fairhaven]]. Specifically, it appears that [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]] was helping finance their work and coordinating his involvement with the [[Eberronian First Division]]. [[Burston Courtev]] was responsible for making physical, bodily undead - making their bodies into one being. [[Salid]] was responsible for the internal side, their minds and personalities and powers - keeping their personalities throughout the process. Any deadlines mentioned are in the past. There's been one conversation since we finished [[Getting Freaky in Viliki]], confirming their work will continue under their new benefactor, from [[Salid]]. We get the strong sense this was unofficial necromancy, it's pretty clearly damning evidence against them.

After breaking the code, we give each other honorifics. 

Then we help [[Costi]] strategizing being cool with [[Elena]], without leaning too hard into being loyal or disloyal to [[Eberron]]. We decide he shouldn't talk about it too much, and instead getting her talking about her.

We talk a bit about the economy and people's salaries, which leads to learning about [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s brother new job [[Branton Spout]] - which is considered a good job, and he's making about 30gp a year, but can move up to 80gp. The [[De'Ore]] program in [[Dilandil]] helps teach and grow stewards to serve prestigious families. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] spends that time casting divination. 

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] go to [[AVAD]] to speak to [[Costi's mom]]. [[Costi]] asks what she knows about the [[Aldea]] family, she says they have money but aren't that important. There's only so long they can hold off [[Elena]] from joining the [[ELA]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] then asks [[Costi]] to leave. He says he was asking [[TrueSilver]] how to keep [[Costi]] and [[Elena]] together, and they said it was not possible in our current situation. [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] tells [[Hugh|Finn]] to respect the path he chooses for himself - something she's been trying to learn herself. If he chooses this life, it comes with sacrifices. She hopes one day he'll have the chance to be himself in a safer, better [[Eberron]].

While they're gone [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks if [[Rez]] heard back from [[Eirian]]. She makes some excuses and goes to check-in, [[Rughork]] is dead, there's no details there. Her best guess, he was an intermediary for a demonologist hired by the person actually mad at Costi. Tracks covered well. 

[[Rez]] has some harebrained theories, then arrives at the same conclusion as [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] at the same time -- sounds like [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]. Fuck.

We make our way to the bar where we will meet [[Marius A]] and [[Elena]]. As soon as we're in the Barracks District we notice a large increase in undead. Many are in chains, and almost everyone else is in [[Eberronian Military]] garb. On our way to the [[Seven Shields]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] notice several of [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]]'s men. The vibes are weird, specifically around us - sometimes good and sometimes not good. We are easily and quickly recognized. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] reminds us this is exactly what [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]] told us to do. 

We arrive at the bar, almost everyone here without exception is in uniform, minus [[Marius A]]. He's with three friends, [[Geuka]] - a human woman in her late thirties, heavily armored, with a whip on her hip, [[Brivol]] - the beefiest, a human male bruiser type with a shaved head, and [[Raror]] - who is an enigma.  He insists on paying, and we all get a round of drinks. Then [[Elena]] arrives. She is pale, slight, walking more confidently than she used to. She turns out to be a huge nerd, with a book holster. She challenges [[Rez]], who does her normally abnormal uncannily trial of other skills.

Right away, [[Hugh|Finn]] starts to flirt with [[Geuka]], who shares that the city has been on edge, raids, "sent us into a hole" a week and a half ago. Like they're on campaign. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] starts the 'flirting' with [[Marius A]]. She's so good at doing it with just a constant undercurrent of almost insult. She also tries to get some information on why people are responding that way to us, but doesn't give much on how he really thinks. He alludes to people saying we're ill-intentioned (undermining [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]], working to destroy [[Eberron]] as spies for [[Arkhosia]]). He claims to ignore it and says many more talk about the lives [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] saved. He counts a few friends among those. 

[[Marius A]] and [[Costi]] catch up a little bit, [[Elena]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] getting strangely heated for a moment then recover, then [[Marius A]] challenges [[Freya]] to a duel. [[Elena]] says he was trained excellently in [[Haag Kitot]]. We talked briefly about [[Millik]] and his genocidal tendencies, sweet guy, it was a different time, but probably not a good behavior. 

Finally, [[Freya]] and [[Marius A]] begin their fight. It turns out [[Marius A]] is not, in fact, faking how good of a fighter he is. That doesn't stop our [[Freya]] from edging out a win though!

As we all know, fighting gets [[Freya]] going and it turns out [[Marius A]] only has eyes for her now. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Geuka]] are still talking. 

[[Rez]] encourages [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to leave [[Costi]] and [[Elena]] alone to catch up. [[Elena]] mentions that [[Marius A]] has been helpful in delaying her compulsory service. 

[[Elena]] tries to prank [[Rez]] and push her together with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], sitting in her lap unexpectedly. Before [[Rez]] can even fully process, [[Freya]] brings [[Marius A]] over and says it's not okay to sit in the lap of people who are sleeping with others, and as she thought was obvious, [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] are together, and she is their third occasionally. It devolves into chaos, but [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] both lean in too, but before that can turn into anything *interesting* the sounds of commotion outside draw us to the street.

3 humans, 1 gnome, 1 halfling they are all beaten and being dragged along by a group of [[Eberronian First Division]] soldiers. [[Costi]] recognizes the halfling from dinners at his house as a child. Says they found these [[ELA]] members together, one of them squealed, and they're happy to face the consequences tomorrow to kill them tonight. [[Marius A]] tries to push legal order, but the main antagonist [[Storth]] whispers something in his ear. 

The moment breaks, and the crowd defers to [[Marius A]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] heals them, [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] gets some dirty looks, and but then sends the 5 to get safely returned to face trail. He doesn't want to see anyone killed if they don't deserve it. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] thanks him, and the mood turns a little introspective.

We head back into the bar. 

 [[Marius A]] talks further with [[Costi]], worried about the path [[Eberron]] is on. He genuinely wants to see [[Eberron]] turn into a better place. [[Costi]] says he does too, and he also thinks [[Cliff Burbank]] wants to as well. It seems to resonate with [[Marius A]].

[[Hugh|Finn]] spirals but doesn't end up saying anything more than he should. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] confronts [[Elena]] about what her game is - after sharing a secret, [[Elena]] says she wanted to see if what they said about [[Costi]] is true, but won't say what that is. She also says she sat in [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s lap to drive [[Rez]] crazy, and seems to think it was working. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to dig deeper but [[Elena]] doesn't really bite. She says she needs to go, and leaves to say goodbye to [[Costi]]. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] abruptly leaves, and catches [[Elena]] on the way out. He says he's struggling with having trust issues, and only really trusts [[Costi]] here. He hopes that can extend, [[Elena]] seems non-committal, then taps [[Hugh|Finn]]'s guard pin. Weird. 

[[Marius A]] leaves our group, saying he hopes we can experience a safe and beautiful [[Jezeten]] at some point in the future. He compliments [[Hugh|Finn]] on his way out. 

The mood is not what expected, so we decide to head back to our hotel. On the way, [[Hugh|Finn]] tells us [[Grishomec Teld|Colonel Teld]]'s man watched us all night in the bar and follows us until we're out of the Barracks District. 

We recap some, and all decide to keep our distance from [[Elena]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] shares that he asked [[TrueSilver]] how to help determine if she's on her side, and said it wasn't a good idea and [[Elena]] / [[Costi]], asking how can [[Costi]] let [[Elena]] know he still wants libration for [[Eberron]] without compromising our cover. [[TrueSilver]] sent a omen as a vision, a plate falls to the ground and breaks in two. You take it, and try to put it back together, but no matter how hard you try you can’t seem to make them fit together right. At the end of the spell, both halves of the plate turn to dust.

[[Hugh|Finn]] sending to [[Elena]], "I know what I saw. I saw you try to slip a note for [[Costi]]. If you don’t want to help. Be better or stay away."
