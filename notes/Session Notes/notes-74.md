# Detailed Notes: Session 74

[[Hugh]] is concerned [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] will hold it against us if we go to  [[The Guardians]] [[Fundraiser]]. He suggests sending to [[Willen Guruden]] about it, but before they can discuss more [[Freya]] comes out of her sick room.

She’s concerned [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] will have to leave [[Arkhosia (City)]] quickly and the party talks about what they need to do before we go: [[Freya]] wants to talk to [[Caleb Schleuse]], and get [[my hole]] back. [[Costi]] wants to go to the [[Halls of the Dead]] again. [[Hugh]] says he’d like to try contacting someone from the visions he’s had. 

He’s never tried to sending to someone who’s dead, so he’s not sure if he’d know the difference. They’re slightly worried about [[Hugh]]'s brain, so they tie him up before he starts. He clarifies, not sexually, which details the group for a minute. He says warforged can be trained in espionage… [[Hugh]]’s a honeypot??

They discuss what to do if things go poorly. [[Jade]] says she can put him in another plan if she needs to, but the [[Freya]] suggestion she helps [[Hugh]] have a powerful mind to succeed at the sendings.

[[Hugh]] talks through who he’s seen in his visions - he fears the older gnome might already be dead, based on how long war forged can live. He’s worried about the lizard folk because [[General Korsas]] recognized him, and she was kidnapped 113 years ago. Previously attempts to sending [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]] have failed. That leaves the scarred human and the bearded dwarf. Just this process requires [[Hugh]] to deeply concentrate, but he decides to move forward. 

He begins with the bearded dwarves figure “I don’t know your name, but I am familiar with you. I am war forged who has lost their memories, [[SVN529]]. Are you alive? Where are you?” There’s no answer. Hugh gets a distinct feeling that he remembers. Like trying to punch through something but finding only air. The lack of *something* is palpable and throws him off balance. 

He tries the scarred human this time. His mind struggles with the task, but he manages the sending - “I don’t know your name. Saw a vision with you. I am warforged who has lost their memory. [[SVN529]]. Are you alive? Where are you?”

This time, he feels the magic connect as a voice responds “2 9? *static*” as the rest of our party sees his go bright red. As he notices he is bound, he initiatives capture protocol. He rages. He rips through the binds and he attacks [[Freya]]. 

His arm sharpens on one end to a sword, and he makes three attacks. He can also utilize battle master tactics, which he does to great effect against [[Freya]]. He’s stronger than before, and an extremely effect fighter. 

[[Costi]] sees him cutting [[Freya]] down into ribbons and polymorphs [[Hugh]] - peering through the future to pick on where he is less hearty to resist. As [[Hugh]] begins speeding up, he is suddenly turned into a snail. The snail, [[Snugh]], if you will, is still angrily making its way towards to [[Freya]]. 

The party tries to figure out how to keep [[Hugh]] from hurting anybody. [[Jade]] tries to remember if she’s ever heard of something like this before, but she knows most of what she’s heard is probably lies. [[Costi]] thinks about appearing like the dwarf or the human and placing [[Hugh]] into the box to contain him. [[Freya]] is concerned he will kill [[Costi]]. [[Jade]] is worried the human face might’ve triggered him and could be an enemy to him. [[Freya]] suggests we sending to [[Magister]] through the [[Circlet of Sending]], and [[Costi]] takes the circlet from [[Rez]].

“[[Hugh]] sendinged to someone from past. His idea. Now attacking us, strong, angry, red eyes. Polymorphed him - still concerned. Help! How do we stop him?” [[Magister]] responds, “You did well. His internal protocols should kick in soon, he’s not meant to stay like this for long. He needs to work this out himself”.

Around the same time, this angry angry snail stops gnawing on [[Jade]]'s thumb. He starts just scooting around and so the party believe [[Hugh]] might have calmed. They discuss how to put him down in another room. [[Freya]] is worried that he’d be left alone but also thinks he’ll feel really bad for how she’s hurt. So they wrap her in a sheet and put the gruung coat over it. [[Jade]] preps a spell to hold [[Hugh]], and [[Freya]] is ready to fight if needed. The set [[Snugh]] in the corner and [[Costi]] drops polymorph. 

[[Hugh]] comes back to himself. He remembers a voice, but nothing after it. The party dances around what happened at first. [[Hugh]] says the human is alive and simultaneously [[Costi]] says “Great!” while [[Freya]] says “let’s not talk about that”. [[Hugh]] notices some blood running down [[Freya]]’s leg while she tells him something happened. 

She tells [[Hugh]] their plan to have her be attacked and keep everyone else safe worked. But [[Hugh]] DID beat the shit out of her with a sword arm. They discuss if they could learn more, but scared from the last detect thoughts with [[Costi]], they decide to at least sleep first. They’re trying to let the lesson of “don’t fuck with other peoples brains”. 

[[Hugh]] apologizes for scaring them, and they share that they told [[Magister]]. [[Freya]] asks if [[Hugh]] can pop out his sword arm on his own, and when [[Hugh]] is confused it seems like he can think about it but not make the transformation.

[[Costi]] has a profound moment, saying “knowledge is not free, sometimes you pay in blood”. They agree that [[Hugh]] will not try to do sendings again so he will not accidentally murder them all. [[Hugh]] agrees he will not sending. 

On the other hand, [[Freya]] helpfully says we’ve crossed something off of our list. They try to remember the details of getting in contact with [[Caleb Schleuse]]. 

Before bed, [[Freya]]  asks [[Jade]] for any information she’s gained from her books so she’ll sound smarter in her conversation with [[Caleb Schleuse]]. [[Freya]] recounts where she’s seen her [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]], and [[Jade]] questions if she’ll share that knowledge or not. Especially as there might be a tie between the [[Halls of the Dead Necromantic Chapel]], and we don’t want him to know we ducked with things there. She’ll just talk more generally about the symbol in the book.   

[[Costi]] identifies the scroll from the death halls, he’s very excited. He runs into his room to start copying it into his spell book. 

The party goes to bed. [[Jade]] is awakened by the same feeling they get from [[The Curator]] but they’re no where to be found. She peaks over the bed, and sees their mask peeking out from under the bed. 

She states earlier that she was hoping for an apology, but we’re unsure if it should come from them. [[Jade]] says she has questions, and asks if the crypt in the death halls is of interest to her. When they say it is of great interest to them, [[Jade]] pivots as says unfortunately they have to talk about [[Costi]] detect thoughts. [[Jade]] says her brain is her own, but [[The Curator]] says they share up there. Jade wants to know if [[Costi]] should be scared, and that she can invite anyone in she’d like. [[The Curator]] stands firm that [[Costi]]’s mind is all his own. [[Jade]] tries to deter them from saying ominous things, and [[The Curator]] thinks it’s fun. Annoyed, they finally relent [[Jade]] can share that it’s alright. She’s interested in him, but not right now. 

[[Jade]] introspects about the yawning pit of answers that she simultaneously wanted and feared - it seems like it’s internal to her rather than [[The Curator]]. They agree to give them a heads up if [[Jade]] can control it - and then they can be sure they are shown what is right. 

[[The Curator ]]asks if [[Jade]] can show them something. At [[The Guardians]] [[Fundraiser]], a dwarven [[Gaundon Skullmall]], a general of moderate renown. She wants to see him [[eating cheese]], it would be beneficial if [[Jade]] can ensure it is a white cheese. They are not familiar if it will be an easy or difficult ask. They agree to leave [[Costi]]’s mind alone unless [[Costi]] asks to speak to them. They pull out a pin with a porcelain end, saying if [[Costi]] is interested, he can use it.  They set the [[Curator porcelain pin]] aside. 

[[The Curator]] says the skeletons in the [[Halls of the Dead]] answered some questions she’s been pondering. When [[Jade]] asks for those answers, she's rebuffed. Though [[The Curator]] teases she might share more if [[Jade]] succeeds in coordinating [[eating cheese]]. It must be clearly visible and eaten with his right hand. 

They ask for any other report, and [[Jade]] brings up [[Willow]] who was watching [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. He spoke of beings watching him, do they know anything about what those are? They offer this as another possible answer in exhcange for the [[eating cheese]] deal. 

While [[Hugh]] powers down, he feels a symptom he's never felt before. He's inside his head, but outside his body. It blurs for a minute, until it clears and he is inside a luxurious room overlooking the [[Jalantar]]. He has a cigar and glass of whiskey, and he experiences what might be taste for the first time. Across the room in another chair sits [[Magister]]. He asks about [[Hugh]]s day, who says he believes [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is more worried than he is. He shares that the person he sending was sent to him in a vision by [[TrueSilver]]. [[Magister]] seems surprised they responded. He says he's been keeping up with [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], hearing updates from [[Vask]] through [[Rez]]. He says it's embarrassing that [[Rez]] is showing him up by saving a city while he's not, he's thinking of threatening another just to thwart that threat. [[Hugh]] shares his concern that we cannot stop what's happening. 

[[Hugh]] asks if he's ever had a vision, and [[Magister]] alludes to something similar. [[Hugh]] says those he talked to felt important, and doesn't believe they could be bad. [[Hugh]] utilizes the dreamscape to convey all that he heard while sending and in his vision with [[Moradin]] and [[TrueSilver]]. He says his holy symbol is still flashing back, and while it must still hurt someone, it can be himself. 

[[Magister]] says he got something for [[Hugh]], made of pure True Silver, a hat pin - to keep him safe. When asked about [[The Silver Halves]], he says they are not staying safe, it's not really [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]'s style. But they've accomplished goals and create more answers. [[Hugh]] shares descriptions of the people from his vision, along with [[General Korsas]]. He doesn't recognize the backstory people, but is intrigued by the news of [[General Ilka Korsas]]. He thinks perhaps "we can get ahead of this", and will talk to [[Victoria Several|Victoria]]. 

He'll be in [[Arkhosia (City)]] within the next couple months, and asks to know when we leave. He says if [[Vask]] doesn't see [[Rez]] soon he's not sure if he can take it, to which [[Hugh]] agrees. [[The Silver Halves]] hope to see us soon. [[Magister]] says it is difficult for their kind to dream, so leaves [[Hugh]] on the note that he is a worthy addition to [[The Self Made Men]], and encourages him to "keep making himself". He leaves and gives [[Hugh]] a few moments of calm to end his first ever dream.

Before falling asleep, [[Freya]] tries talking to [[The Curator]] through the mark on her back, asking if other oaths conflict with their agreement. There's no response. 

When the party wakes, they talk about their plan for the day. [[Jade]] starts to tease [[Costi]] that he now has to give her all his blood for [[The Curator]], and gives him the [[Curator porcelain pin]] [[Hugh]] sees through it, but it seems to please them, and they give [[Jade]] a little boost. [[Hugh]]'s feeling sharp, and prays extra well this morning. His holy symbol is flickering black now. He can choose to heal slightly, or hurt others whenever he casts a spell through it. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] talks about how to get into [[The Providers]] [[Fundraiser]], and decide to have [[Hugh]] sending to [[Willen Guruden]]. There's some disagreements about what to say, and [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] debates how we should talk to him. We decide to try the beguiling route first and use our favors if we need them. [[Hugh]] eventually sends, "Hello. Heard you are hosting important fundraiser. We would love to attend. [[Costi]] is interested and wants to learn from YOU. Can speak of GRUNGSLAYINGS." He responds, "[[Hugh]], are you feeling alright? Of course you can come. I'm rather busy up until the event, but come 2 hours early. Shooting. Scotch. Conversation".

They went to confirm that [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] can talk to [[Caleb Schleuse]]. The staff at [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]] got his contact and confirmed he'd be happy to talk to others interested in the mysteries of the multiverse. We plan that conversation for later. They gave us his location [[Wyndla’s Wyvern]], we can head there whenever. 

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] went to the [[Halls of the Dead]] to check in to warn them of a dangerous artifact. [[Costi]] said that he isn't who he says he is, and he can't reveal his true identity but is on an important mission, has knowledge of the future, and his vow to [[The Raven Queen]] was true. He was naturally persuasive. He says the artifact left in the tunnels should be safeguarded. He also sent a prayer up to [[The Raven Queen]] that he believes was well-recieved. 

[[Ravona Drakness]] said that they sent a group of [[Deaths Watchers]] into the [[Duvey]] crypt to check on what was there, and found the tunnel [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] climbed down. They didn't know about it before, the masons they asked to inspect it think it is about six months old. They didn't find any artifact; the mirror is gone. Destroyed or taken, we're not sure.

The [[Duvey]] sitting room looked like it had been completely untouched for years, with all the food having gone rotten and the wine spoiled. Which is odd, as the maintenance logs are up to date as of six days ago. [[Ravona Drakness]] looked into it, and for the last three months the person responsible for those logs did not exist. They checked with the supervisor who signed off on those logs, and it turns out he'd been modify memoried to believe those people existed. [[Ravona Drakness]] thinks that whoever put those undead down there has direct access to the [[Halls of the Dead]]. It's a big note on who else might think, [[Wait There's a Lot of Undead]].
