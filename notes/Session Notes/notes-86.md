# Detailed Notes: Session 86

Before bed, [[Jade]] overhears [[Rez]] casting sending, which apparently she mumbles out loud sometimes. It doesn't seem that she gets anything productive back, and asks [[Jade]] to listen if that happens again.

In the morning, [[Jade]] tells us to keep an eye out for blood sacrifices, we ask if it's related to [[Sseth]] - she says that or for any other reasons. 

We decide we need to go put healing potions, and are talking through our day when [[Rhynilex Svenik]] comes to get us. We say our list is that, to investigate the corrosive liquid that's been appearing (who also sells the potions), look at their patrol routes, and speak to the dead dragonborn. 

Heading to the [[Bahamut]] carcasses, below the main citadel in [[Izdeke]]. She points to a blue dragonborn in blue plate who they think is the leader, she was carrying the prophecy and the scale. All four appear to be women, there's a silver dragonborn in fine robes, a copper dragonborn in a medium breastplate with sheaths on her side, and red dragonbonr in tattered red armor and a bandolier of knives. The silver is our first target, and [[Hugh]] asks:

What is your goal here at the anchor tree?
	To right what is wrong
and how can I help?
	Reclaim [[Bahamut]] touch from drow
What is the Platinum scale named [[Bahamat's Touch]] used for?
	Only [[Lizbit]] knew
How did you receive the prophecy on found on [[Lizbit]] body
	It was given to [[Lizbit]]
I can relay your passing to your superiors, where did you get sanctioned from?
	I served [[Bahamut]] in [[Durmask]]

To the copper dragonborn:

How were you going to find the anchor tree?
	he doesn't answer
what was your plan once you got the anchor tree?
how do you right what is wrong at the tree?
What did you interpret of "scales will harden"
I can bring your body back to the surface, who did Lizbit report to? 
	I won't betray her

To [[Lizbit]]

How is the Platinum scale named [[Bahamat's Touch]] used to right what is wrong at the anchor tree?
	It, with other touches, will mend the void
How did you receive the prophecy on found on your body?
	[[Gulphi Delvinson]] in [[Durmask]]
We also have a touch, what is the most important information you can give to us about the void?
	We know very little, but the risk to the world is severe
If left unchecked, what will happen to the world
	An [[Army of Undeath]]
Who or what is causing the void and the army of the undead?
	We were tasked with gathering that information - we failed, you must not

[[Costi]] asks if we can take [[Bahamat's Touch]], [[Rhynilex Svenik]] says she will keep it until we bring the force of our enemies to the problem. She also wants the [[Blue Rose]] and [[TrueSilver strand]], in case we fall. We push back, but she says we should start with recon and then move through secret tunnels towards the roots once we know what is safe. 

[[Rhynilex Svenik]] says this was useful, and they could've learned much more if they had shown restraint. We say that's important for next time. We're not vey persuasive, but they'll "keep it in mind".

We head to the potion shop. Walking through the city, most of the architecture is black, simple, and pointy. [[Rhynilex Svenik]] tries to intimidate the alchemist, [[Kluthruel]], who instead speaks to us directly. She's very strong in common, having gone to the service 5 times, surpassed only by [[Bagath Mizzragon]]. [[Freya]] asks if they use the [[Wayfinders]], but [[Kluthruel]], says the [[Gia'Thoren]] keep them safe. We ask to see the corrosive goo, and buy healing potions. In a large bucket, there's a viscous black liquid that bubbles and steams. She opens the lid, and a thick fetid smell fills the whole room. She dips a rock, with no reaction, but when she dips bark it's quickly eaten. A similar thing happens when they place a dead mouse inside. She believes anything that is or was organic material is eaten. 

[[Costi]] tries dipping his sword into a bit of it, and [[Raven's Edge]] begins to shake - a dark light pours out of the sword. [[Costi]] feels it push against the liquid, and could evaporate it if he wants. He destroys it and it disappears. She says there's a specific location they've been finding pools, more of it than in other areas, [[Kluthruel]] marks it on [[Rhynilex Svenik]]'s map.

[[Costi]] then puts a bit of it on his skin, recognizing the feel as extremely similar to what we felt in the [[Chapel of the Lost]]. The amount and thickness seem to vary, but she theorizes that the location where it is more permanent might be radiating out from that point we see less duration and amount, the further you move away. 

There are other groups of drow and one larger duergar community they've sent envoys too, but none of them have returned. She would not recommend that we attempt to contact those communities. She doesn't believe any of her neighbors would be involved in the grafting of the strange monsters.

We offer to trade for potions after she says she'll charge us the surface rate - [[Hugh]] offers a blueberry, which magically works very well and gets a greater healing potion. In exchange for saltwater and the blue feathers we get a regular healing potion. We pay a lot of gold and get a supreme, 3 greater, 2 regular, and 8 darkvision potions. We also bought some diamonds. 

[[Hugh]] asks [[Rhynilex Svenik]] if she has a hearth, and she agrees to let him use it for his prayers after hastily cleaning up here room. He asks "Is the group associated with the yellow line in the underdark trying to reach the anchor tree?" The fire burns a deep blue green, flames rising from beneath, the fire then becomes more clear. There's no silver line, but four lines (green, platinum, brown, yellow) same as before are independently moving up the fire, then staggered but at the same time rush to basically go on top of each other. Platinum falls away, but the other three continue. They all remain close but don't overlap each other, except for our line nearly cutting off the platinum one"

We review the maps with [[Rhynilex Svenik]] and [[Freya]] memorizes the maps, we take some down time to recover. [[Hugh]] knits a spider scarf for [[Rhynilex Svenik]]. [[Costi]] and [[Jade]] work on [[Kith and Kin]], [[Rez]]

"HI [[Rawley]], how are you? Seen any drow? Are they cool? Trustworthy? Maybe? Or no? These drow worship [[Lloth]]. Book is hard. Bye." he responds "Well, got yourself in a sticky situation there. No people are monoliths. Drow - suspicious of our kind. Be careful, honest, safe."

We have a mini intervention about [[Freya]]'s growing itching for violence. She says she'll think about it. 

Thinking about things, we remember the ring we pulled off of the undead guys by [[Willow]]. [[Costi]] identifies it, it's a [[Ring of Expanded Necrotic Capacity]], you can store one spell of up to 4th level in the school of necromancy, and requires attunement. [[Rez]] attunes briefly to it to place a blind/deaf to give it [[Jade]].
