# Detailed Notes: Session 59

We wake up and [[Rez]], [[Costi]], and [[Jade]] put their heads together to try and figure out the [[Fire Raiser Cipher]]. They come up with "LAUGHING HILL EIGHT BARRELS", and try to discuss it. We think this is perhaps another code for [[Ulia Glorsbade]], [[Rez]] suggests we sending to her, but the group has reservations. While they work, [[Hugh]] finishes [[Giary]]'s scarf.

We discuss how to figure out to learn more about "laughing hill" and decide to go look at [[Welcome]]'s book, so [[Costi]] goes to search while [[Hugh]] and [[Rez]] travel down to keep [[Welcome]] distracted with their conversation. We find it - there is an inn called the [[Laughing Hill]] in the [[Oceantouched]]! 

Meanwhile, [[Jade]] and [[Freya]] talk about how to better communicate if someone should stop talking... they land on just saying "shut up". [[Freya]] also laments her struggling with filling [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s shoes to keep [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] in line. 

[[Hugh]] tells [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] that [[Welcome]] wanted to sleep with us both, and our group goes on a tagent about getting over old relationships, like [[Qik]] and [[Freya]]'s former lover [[Ronan]]. We devolve for a bit, and then decide to headout meet [[Srictha]].

On the way to [[Puzzler's]], we try to make ourselves seem a bit tougher and dressed less nicely. [[Hugh]] notices an odd gap where perhaps a humanoid should be, and we deduce that perhaps someone is invisibly following us. We all try to look around, [[Costi]] tries to use detect thoughts to hear, but only gets a note of someone thinking warmly of [[Hugh]]. He then gets [[Samuel]] to try and land on where that person might be. He can't quite sit, but does illicit an exclamation that helps us know they're there. [[Hugh]] almost charges them, but we all stop that conflict and try to see if there's a good way to see them. [[Rez]] pulls out her bag of mischief and hands everyone some chalk - we can just throw it and maybe track them that way? As we walk into [[Puzzler's]], [[Jade]]'s glasses flash gray, and when she uses the ability ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]) she gets a message that says [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. Sensing opportunity [[Freya]] takes [[Costi]]s chalk and uses it with a gust spell to create an area of effect. It works enough to tag the arm of our stalker, but also attracts a guard. We fumble with an excuse, but end up just paying him 2gp to make it go away. 

[[Rez]] and [[Costi]] enter the bar, [[Freya]] stands guard outside, while [[Jade]] and [[Hugh]] go down the alley after our invisible tail, throwing off the angry mob by using an illusion of them sitting dejectedly outside the bar. They go to investigate the dust leftover, and notice relatively normal humanoid-sized footprints. 

As the other half of the party enters the bar, everyone must answer a riddle on our way in. The bar has puzzle pieces along the wall that almost cause shifting images from different perspectives. [[Rez]] messages to [[Srictha]], and he directs us to a back corner where he is. We discuss if we should leave to try and lose our tail, but [[Srictha]] thinks this is about the safest place and we warn the bouncer so we can stay. 

[[Jade]] introduces hersself to [[Srictha]] and we all briefly discuss what the tail could have to do with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and we learn her glasses almost always give a clue card most closely related to that exact moment. 

[[Srictha]] is staying at the [[Goat's Hollow]], a hotel in town. He says [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Klida]] is good, she flew them down and he shares she also loves this bar (how could she not??). After a mere-milisecond of mistrust, we start to tell him everything about [[Ulia Glorsbade]]. [[Srictha]] thinks that the [[Fire Raiser Cipher]] might be an new order, of some sort of "vintage" or speciality of hers. He says the [[Laughing Hill]] is only 15 minutes from [[Puzzler's]], it's nice for the neighborhood but doesn't think it's central to the [[Fire Raisers]]. He says it's normal to take the message and confirm it's still what you need, and then deliver the "barrels" afterwards. He says the [[Fire Raisers]] ciphers can change every couple weeks, so he can't help. But the [[Laughing Hill]] would probably have the vintage referenced in stock so that it's believable if found. [[Costi]] mentions that the [[Goodbarrels]] distillery has been around for about 1,100 years but barrels over a couple hundred years are extremely rare. We deduce this means that it's most likely 3434, could be 3232 or 3131, but likely within those years.

[[Srictha]] also says he worked very closely with [[Winifey|Winnie]] as the two people from [[The Furnace]] who were out and about. He thinks we can trust her. But not [[Cinder]], who he thinks is very angry. He told us saying "freedom will rise" "from the ashes" and talk of phoneix, to be a bit more believable as we talk to folks. He trusts her, and yet he won't reach out to her until he knows more. He only is talking to his friend [[Varras]], a former [[Arkhosia Guards]] and one of the orignial [[Fire Raisers]]. 

He gave us some updates, that the [[Arkhosia (City)]] group of [[Fire Raisers]] is smaller, but he thinks they're all here. He expects that they all know us. The leader of the cell here is [[Willum]], apparently he was one of the founders. [[Varras]] was in the guard with him. He says the two different cities act independently, but [[Willum]] and [[Cinder]] seem to co-lead together. He says [[Varras]] was loathe to the violence, it was one fo the reasons he left the guard. He would connect [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] to him, and he seems to agree on the tactic we want to see. He says we can all meet together. He's also talked to [[Terrav]] and [[Zephyra]]. [[Varras]] works at [[Flyte]]. 

[[Varras]] told him about the [[Cloud's Lament]], he thinks something is going to happen on the pier or in the quay. Every year a celebration takes place their before the [[Arkhosian Elections]], this year it's supposed to be on the 4th works day on the month. 

He says the all the other freedom fighter groups are supporting each other, but the [[ELA]] is not helping the [[Fire Raisers]] currently. The divide within the group is new enough though that their allies haven't weighed in. 

He thinks, if he had to guess, they might be hyper-vigilant on people they can trust as they get more extreme. There was recruitment efforts happening a month ago but it's probably tightening up now. 

We decide to hang out at this bar for the rest of the night to see if [[Pruvki Forgaveat]] shows up, and stay so that we can be there for our potential breakfast meet-up, and then stop by the [[Laughing Hill]].
