# Detailed Notes: Session 51

For recap, see also: 

We talk about what we're going to find at the [[Fire Raisers]] hideout, and what we might say to [[Ulia Glorsbade]] if we find her. [[Giary]] says she's an explosives expert and affiliated with the [[Thelran Asari]] goodbarrels, who run a well-known "secret" criminal outfit. She's more a consultant than a true believer. 

Knowing what we do about [[Niko]], and especially [[Winifey]] and [[Cinder]], we decide that any information we find there might be a fake plant, and to take it with a grain of salt. 

We get back on the road, and travel for about 3 hours, and in the late afternoon we see a broken down stone structure [[Fort Chyvasti]]. A collection of ruins open to the air on the road between [[Jalantar]] and [[Arkhosia (City)]]. The ceilings are blasted open, with large chunks of rock in a several hundred foot radius.  There's a large watchtower that is still standing, dispite holes throughout it's structure. 

It used to be a military outpost before cities were consolidated becfore [[The Three Dragons War]], but seems to have been targeted in the attacks and has been ruins ever since. It was the site of a horrific slaughter of more than 700 soliders were burned alive during the [[sundering]]. 

We look for signs of lifes, tracks, or any magical traces. It's heavily covered in dust and seems fully abandoned, but [[Hugh]] spots some disturbances that seem like movement not caused by our party. [[Rez]] tries to message [[Ulia Glorsbade]], reminding her who we are and saying we want to talk about [[Niko]], when there's no response, she follows up and tells her not to ignore us. Still no response.

[[Costi]] wargs into [[Samuel]], who flies around the outside of the tower and up to the top - he finds a nest of several angry crows. [[Costi]] tries to poof him out before he gets pecked to death. Before he does, he spots some shiny things. We chat through our plan to search the ruins, and decide to just walk up the stairs. A bunch of angry crows greet us, and [[Jade]] summons a hoard of flies that rip one bird apart and scare the rest off. 

Once they're gone, we search the area. [[Costi]] finds some Goodbarrel bottle caps, so we think it's like [[Ulia Glorsbade]] was here. [[Hugh]] finds some bird treasures and takes them, but leaves the rest of his nuts and a half knitted project. We head back down to the ground floor, give it a quick once over, and then begin looking for secret entrances.

[[Jade]], running her fingers over the wall, finds a small button that releases a door. It releases a large explosion, and both [[Jade]] and [[Rez]] get some serious burns, [[Rez]] tries messaging [[Ulia Glorsbade]] once more while the rest of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] and [[Giary]] start to head down the tunnel. As we make our way down, we hear running water and open into a small chamber with a chasm running through the middle. There's a rope bridge that's been cut dangling from the far side, and some remnants of stone along the sides and top that might've been support structures before. Down a 40ft drop, there's some lightly moving green water with three tall columns that run from the bottom up to the edge. One 4 ft, one 5ft from that, and the last 4ft away from the middle - it's a short jump to the far edge. 

[[Costi]] brings out his whistle and gives it to [[Giary]], assuming his high strength means he could whistle for a long time. He carries [[Costi]] halfway across, as a metal tube reveals itself and shoots a globe of clear gel at [[Costi]], bouncing of his shield, and another shoots out a ball of fire but doesn't seem to stick. 

[[Jade]] and [[Hugh]] begin jumping across while [[Rez]] tries to block off a gun, but taking damge both [[Jade]] and [[Rez]] misty step. Trying to get out of the range of the cannons, [[Rez]] steps through the open doorway into the passage way beyond. Turns out its a 100ft corridor, 20ft wide and 20ft tall. The second [[Rez]] step through, two pillars on the far end begin spinning and throwing icy projectiles. 

Summoning the spirit of creation, [[Rez]] magically builds a riot shield to block off the projectiles. It's built, heavy metal and almost as tall as she is. It works! And BOY is it heavy, trying to keep it upright, she's not quiiite strong enough, and falls flat on her face with the nifty sheild she made. Calling back to her friends, she asks for her strong friends to come pick this up and use it to keep them all safe. [[Costi]] runs in instead. 

[[Giary]] finally succeeds in punching the flame turret, but mostly just hurts and blows up himself. He and [[Hugh]] and [[Jade]] all enter into the snowball hallway. We all try to hunker down and walk behind the shield. We still take a bit of a beating, sometimes it shoots cold and sometimes fire. Turns out, the end of the hallway is a dead end. We all COMPLETELY understood this as we sprinted towards it. We try to see if there's any hint of way to get through. [[Jade]], with an inate sense of *there's always tunnels* pops her head around, and sees that the there appears to be space below us. We should check the ground.

[[Hugh]] sprints ahead to the pillars and looks over the left one. Every six inches there is a door, some of which occasionally open to reveal a tube that is pressing the projectiles up. [[Giary]] runs out and tries to stop the spinning of the right most pillar, by bear hugging it. [[Costi]] and [[Jade]] try to damage wires in the pillars to stop their shooting. [[Rez]] pours some oil to try and see if there's any leaking into the floor below, and we find the edge of some sort of trap door. We can't find anyway to open the door, but it seems like the only option to open the pillars. We all focus on doing damage to them and as they reach dysfunction they fall into the ground and click, with the trapdoor we found sliding open to reveal stairs leading down.

[[Costi]] casts some light, and we all head down. It leads to a door in the wall, seemingly unlocked and untrapped. [[Rez]] knocks, and we hear some sort of heavy breathing and footsteps. We decide to try and open the door and expect the monster inside to charge through to attack them, when it does [[Hugh]] will open the door, and we all rush through the door way as it attacks. We'll try to rush into the room beyond behind it, and [[Rez]] will close the door behind them with her mage hand -- trapping the beast beyond. 

Two tendrils wip out and try to grab the illusions, and a basilisk runs through to tear through the illusions. We try to run into the room, but [[Hugh]] catches eye contact and begins to harden. [[Giary]] grabs him and carries him through, and we successfully run in and shut the door. 

We turn around, and see a large metal bull and a fleshy mass growing out of the wall, with one large eye and four tentacles waving out of it's body. It's a gorgon and a roper! The fight starts out really bad, and both [[Costi]] and [[Jade]] begin turning to stone. We end up knocking them both out, and [[Costi]] turns into a giant ape. We know, as people, he failed his last con save and will become stone as soon as he drops his polymorph
