# Session 171

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] goes to the [[Captain's Wharf]] from our rooms in [[The Silver Tongue]]. The are several dozens of ships at the Wharf, in what's essentially a larger sea port, despite being on [[Yent Lake]] instead of a sea. 

We board our chartered ship. On board is [[Eirian|E]]'s crew, and a new figure, [[Ferdinand]]. [[Samson]] discuss his pseudo-adopted adult son with [[Hugh|Finn]]. [[Rez]] wasn't aware this is such a common dynamic. 

We distribute the disguise self hats: [[Ghez Yhutl]] will be [[Vask]], [[Samson]] will be [[Eirian]], [[Costi]] will be invisible then [[Rez]], [[Rez]] will be [[Costi]]. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] plays the harp to herself in introspection about her feelings, the music finds it's way to [[Rez]], who feels the slightest alleviation of her anxiety, knowing [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] will be there for the [[Boulder Makers Counterattack]]. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] asks [[TrueSilver]] for "whatever assistance she can give to help [[Rez]] and [[Rez's Family]]", but it doesn't seem to connect. [[Hugh|Finn]] tries to death ward [[Costi]], who helpfully points out [[Rez]] is the one to be targeted. 

After making our way across [[Yent Lake]], we land about 15 minutes outside [[Fenswick Cove]]. [[Eirian|E]] and [[Vask]] take their group first, and [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] waits 30 minutes to head towards the main entrance. [[Rez]] makes herself look like [[Costi]]. 

We briefly make our way through the woods, in what should be a gorgeous lakeside afternoon, if not for the worry and dread. 

If we didn't know it was there, we wouldn't have maybe seen the metal door hidden into a rocky wall. We've found the [[Unscaled]]'s hide out. 

We stealthy approach the door, thanks to some magic. [[Freya]] turns on her ability to see magic, and we can tell the front door is alarm. [[Hugh|Finn]] dispels it so we can make our way inside. However, the door is still trapped, and [[Costi]] recognizes they use dunamancy to summon what [[Rez]] knows is dragonfire. [[Freya]] spies through the purple swirling vortex a chained red dragon. Even after, the door was immensely hard to lock - it's clear they have strong magic and are extremely well resourced. 

We head down a dark stairwell, until we meet a small chamber another door. It's clearly enchanted, and has no obvious handle. [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] are able to immediately clock a recession with various levels that is exactly in the shape of dragonscales. Starting with as small wrymling, human, young, adult, and ancient dragonscales. It will accept any of them, [[Rez]] pulls out an adult blue scale. Upon placing it in the lock, it's shared into the perfect size and then disappears. 

Moving forward, there's a long hallway, with ten doors. Above each doors are a few words written, all in a different languages (giant, elvish, dwarvish, gobblin, gith, abyssal, terrin, celestial, draconic) "Forward with what is necessary" except the entrance "Backwards empty handed" in common

[[Hugh|Finn]] notes that while everything is well maintained, and there's almost no difference between the doors, though the two closest to the entrance have been used slightly more often. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Freya]] - there's no sound behind any of them, likely due to the magic aura on each of them: dunamantic and conjuration. [[Costi]] notices a loose stone, it's surprisingly heavy - lead. [[Freya]] pulls it out, noticing it's hollow - there are 3 small dragonscales: silver, gold, and copper scales. There's runic writing on them, it seems to be a spell, all with the same dunamantic and conjuration. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] gets into [[My Hole]], [[Freya]] hold it, along with the three runed scales, and opens one of the two most used doors, with the draconic writing. It pulls her into a swirling nebula of stars, thrown into a new door right back into the hallway. She did see flits of movement and other door on either side of her. An iron golem, a stone golem, and several Gith appear. It's a tough fight, but we overcome, banishing both the golems and killing the gith. 

We take a moment to heal up, and journey down another set of stairs, into what hope is the last chamber before the lift down. It's a large circular room, seemingly empty at first. Stalagtites and stalagmites are throughout the space. As we step in, a dark purple orb appears in the center of the room. Suddenly, the enter room starts to rotate. We're pulled around, and quickly learn that anything into the orb is quickly atomized. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] casts fly and catches [[Rez]] (how romantic), [[Costi]] and [[Freya]] find a way to stay on the floor, [[Hugh|Finn]] gets the [[Immovable Rod]] thrown to him and in a cool move catches and activates it to hover above the orb. A spinning rock shell orbits around the room, mostly blocking off the door, in an erratic way. We plan a way to time it out to when the door is visible for [[Costi]] to dispel the orb, [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Freya]] watching the room spin, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] coaching the timing, and [[Rez]] inspiring [[Costi]]. 

Through that door is yet another staircase, though for the first time they are fine, carved out of white marble. Pillars line the walk, each with images of noble humanoid races. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] picks up the carvings are old, but not ancient - probably around [[The Second Sundering]]. It seems we've found the lift. 

We enter into a large cavern, filled with activity. A chained stone giant, collared and contained, is doing something to a pool of pure clear water. Two humanoids with dragon pieces grafted onto them. There's a number of humanoids in blue robes, and some larger humanoids with weapons near the door. Three most notable, a human right in the front, posed and smiling, a gnome in red robes with a large bulbous nose [[Bhula Orbnose]], and a red dragonborn.

Many of them, including [[Bhula Orbnose]], wear jewelry made of dragonscales. [[Rez]] is on her bullshit but in an abnormally focused way - she starts blasting and it goes very well. [[Rez]] kills [[Bhula Orbnose]], but as she dies, her tongue turns into a dragon's she bites it off and swallows the blood, bringing her back. Similarly, the barbarian covered in purple stones, is able to stay up despite his brain literally split open. He's clearly insane, and has a black dragon scale grafted onto him.

[[Zalvaris|Zalv]] uses the [[Javelin of Orbnose Slaying]] he inherited from Uncle [[Stalwart Mudd]] to kill [[Bhula Orbnose]] for good this time. [[Hugh|Finn]] is knocked unconscious multiple times. [[Costi]] takes more dizit, and deals a fuck ton of absorbed acid damage. [[Freya]] very successfully picks up several people to drop them in the most advantageous way. [[Rez]]'s summoned dragon is able to rip the head open of the barbarian. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gets [[Hugh|Finn]] up, breaks blindness just to better look at [[Rez]], and get a naturally strong smite on the draconic abomination to death. 

After one of the wildest and most complicated fights we've ever had, [[Zmaj]] and [[Zalvaris|Zalv]] race up, find [[Eirian]] and [[Vask]] unharmed, and bring them down to reconvene with [[Rez]] and [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]].
