# Detailed Notes: Session 98

We arrive back at our hotel, and debrief. [[Hugh]] tries to scry on [[Shay]], he sees her walking through the streets of [[Viliki]], he notes a [[Building 17]], a nondescript house in the middle of a row. As she walks in, nothing really sticks out about the house. She pours a glass of wine and sits at a fire that's already lit. She looks satisfied, in general. 

Before bed [[Costi]] tries to send to [[Marius Lupu]], saying "Marius, how are you? It's been too long, I've heard rumors that you're missing? Would love to hear otherwise. In [[Eberron]]! Where are you?", he gets back, "[[Costi]]! I miss you brother. Why are you back here? Things are happening. They're in motion. I'll tell you when I can. Warmths Embrace"

We talk some about [[Costi]]'s [[AVAD]] relationships, learn that [[Marius A]] is a believer in [[Eberron]] but not necessarily an asshole. [[Costi]] is convinced his family wants to become undead. 

We decide to start by talking to [[Captain Kalorek Plunderov]],  and learn what we can from the 'official' investigation. Walking in, there's a number of [[Eberronian Military]] from the [[Eberronian Second Division]]. They're expecting us, and an armored woman is brought to greet us, she's [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim]]. She has medium blonde hair, pale, and carries two swords. 

She's lead the day to day investigations, and seems a little prickly for the help. She says [[Captain Kalorek Plunderov]] has been preoccupied with an unusually aggressive group of harpies along the coasts. We give her all of the information we've heard thus far, and she offers to provide reports on the additional information we need. She confirms that most of those missing have been from the fishers, they don't believe the harpies are directly correlated -- unless they are lashing out to encroachment of their territory in the nearby mountains. More bodies that have fallen off the cliffs have been unrecovered then expected as well. 

Her leading theory is a group led by [[Shari]] that's called [[Shari's Boys]]. Despite the name, they are dangerous, and have operated in [[Viliki]] as a thieves group for about 11 years. They began as children being relatively harmless. Leadership in the town was soft-handed in her opinion. However, they've evolved in recent years to accumulate the materials necessary for necromancy. She says they've busted them a few times for body parts, limbs and organs, blood, occasionally incense and jewels. Clearly trafficking them to illegal necromancers. She's posits they've moved into doing the necromancy themselves now, as it's more profitable. They can't located [[Shari]] but they are growing in number. They still employee children, but are non-discriminatory in their enrollment. 

She says her suspicions first started two or three weeks after the death rate increase was noticed, [[Shari's Boys]] normal criminal work seemed to stop. There's no way they've found to identify them, and they've been attempting to gain more information for a long time. 

She's got some pretty problematic views on crime, if they'd just killed or maimed those children they wouldn't be able to take their predisposition to evolve into violent criminals. When pressed for more leads, she points to the [[Founding Flagon]]. 

The [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim]] offers to show us their necromancy lab for reference. Giving them an out, [[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] head to the [[Ratoucha]] to talk to [[Marina Alduchev]]. We ask for some magical items that can help disguise us, which is agreed to if we leave collateral (200 gp pp), we get 5.

[[Rez]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], and [[Freya]] head to the labs. It is extremely sterile and clean in appearance, chairs with straps and floor drains are spaced along the area. She showcases the area, and seemingly hints at her dissatisfaction with the lack of necromancy. [[Rez]] asks if they've put a magical trace on their requirement equipment, and we learn they've only recently been allowed to acquire them - they requisitioned them from the licensed necromancers, but will look into adding a trace moving forward. The necromancers will now utilize the military space for their work. 

We learn that the bare minimum necromancers need: raw gems, namely about 500gp worth of diamonds, a circle of salt, a pint of human blood, and fresh bodies. Older bodies are less likely to be as effective, those that cast must be within a week. As we leave, she asks us to provide a report at the end of each day. 

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] find our temporary office space in the [[Ratoucha]]. They find an annotated map, some meetings spaces, some interrogation restraints, and workspaces. We have a porter as well, [[Lara Frozenwatcher]]. They sent the list of necromancers to the hotel. [[Costi]] asks for a list of all the employees, and is told is can come from payroll. He flounders a bit for how to get around the worry of [[Shay]], and eventually tells her that there's a potential suspect and asks that it's compiled by a man. 

We ask [[Lara Frozenwatcher]] to leave a note for [[Marina Alduchev]] to meet us after work at the [[Founding Flagon]]. She also provides us the known legal necromancers: [[Sinan]], [[Zesnel Ponner]], [[Mim]], [[Seshum Cinen]]. Also a list of the entire staff at the [[Ratoucha]] - there's no [[Shay]] in payroll, so we gather she gave [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Hugh]] a false identity. She's going to pull addresses with 17 in the list and add them to our map. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] heads to speak with [[Security Director Aldi]]. When we arrive it's empty, and no one answers our knock. Looking for nearby guards, we don't notice any street patrols but we do see two conspicuous people watching in the windows, [[Rez]] talks to one who does a poor job seeming subtle, and asks him to alert [[Security Director Aldi]] that we're sent to talk to him by [[Cliff Burbank|Colonel Burbank]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talks to the other, who plays it much more cool. [[Costi]] sends [[Rez]] to ask the northern guard something, to distract her. She agrees without question, and ends up making plans to drink in an ally near Docker Ave later. Not sus at all. While they're preoccupied, [[Costi]] sends an arcane eye through the chimney and into the building. It's empty, and most the documents seem tucked away. He then sends it into the room where the 'guards' are - he's clearly keeping a list of who is coming by. On the other floors, there are [[Eberronian Military]] guards hanging around. We note that this is weird, and none of us jump to conclusions at all about it. 

After waiting for a bit, we decide to head to the [[Viliki Boneyard]] instead. On the way [[Costi]] checks the southern part of [[Viliki]] for [[Building 17]] but finds nothing.

It's large, with multiple mausoleums, and a skeleton approaches us - it's [[Pooka]]. He's heard of us, and is seemingly happy to have more help. We learn his creator has been dead for 72. He says there's been increased activity in the last 6 months - when we ask what, he says the "regular military exhumations", which we learn occurs happens to anyone buried in the boneyard - or all regular [[Eberron]] citizens. There are, currently, 36 tiers to who is chosen first for the process of being turned undead, but it's update annually. 19 full exhumations have happened that are not officially accounted for. There are posted guards now to help lookout - the last was 9 days ago. For more than half of those missing, they were stolen at the same time as official military exhumations. There have been some items left behind, but they all seem like they're from the graves. [[Pooka]] also plans to introduce us to the most senior guard there. 

We're led to a red tiefling with black tattoos across his face named [[Tallshard]]. He says he's "stopped three", seeing figures in dark shifts. We hope for information, and mostly learn that this guy's a hot idiot.
