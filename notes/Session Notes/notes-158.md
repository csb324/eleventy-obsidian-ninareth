# Detailed Notes: Session 158

[[Costi]] shares that his goals for drinks with [[Marius Lupu]] is just to have fun and escape from the thought that many of the people he cares about may soon be dead. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] tries to help our unhinged party have a dose of reality about the real risk to our lives in our plan [[A Murder of Dukes]]. 

We decide to go and drink about it. Approaching [[The Cellar]], we use the designated knock pattern and are let in. [[Costi]] uses some magic to try and CYA, turning on see invisibility and leaving an arcane eye watching the door (28). 

It's jaunty in there, a few dozen people dancing and drinking, live music, and our friends [[Niko]], [[Giary]], [[Terrav]], and [[Zephyra]] are there too. We learn it's one of the 12 [[ELA]] safehouses. [[Marius Lupu]], it turns out, is on a coolness high and is making the most of it. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] goes over to our table of friends, who share that they are working their own group name. It's pretty clear they think [[Marius Lupu]] is pretty lame. 

Meanwhile, we learn [[Marius Lupu]] was asked to leave [[AVAD]] - he stole a shipment of crystal balls from the school to scroll on [[Eberronian Military]] positions. He was already a revolutionary, and then realized he was sneaky and quick with his hands already, plus he doesn't mind hurting people who need hurting. 

[[Marius Lupu]] shares that many folks in the [[ELA]] that are still skeptical of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] and that we're tricking leadership, though [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]] and [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]] are strongly backing us. We learn his parents left [[Eberron]] when he joined the [[ELA]], they're in [[The Slavaadi College]]. 

As we talk, [[Costi]] notices through the arcane eye that someone clocked the entrance to [[The Cellar]]. He decides to send the eye to track her. She heads back into the [[Duchal District]] but the eye drops off before the [[Palace Dharinov]]. 

We learn [[Elena]] was trying to sus out [[Costi]], she was originally going to join the student stunt at [[AVAD]], but then didn't show up. We get warned that some of the non-[[ELA]] students are still really active are maybe going to stage some protests at [[AVAD]] and we should stay clear. [[Elena]] was kicked out of that group, and [[Marius Lupu]] is going to try and get her to stay at a safehouse on [[ELA Day of Action]]. 

[[Marius Lupu]] shares that [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] was read writ-large by [[ELA]] as a plant, that she has cop energy: she's intentional, and neat, and seems like she has a lot to lose, unlike other folks here. He tries to get [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to share what we're doing. 

[[Marius Lupu]] stages a mage pong game for [[Costi]]'s benefit. [[Rez]] and [[Giary]] play opposite them, and are both conned and crushed. He gives him the [[3449 tricity magepong invitational gold medal]] 

[[Niko]] says they will be wandering the streets trying to take out whoever the most high profile target they can find. We discuss the pros and cons between [[Teld]] and [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]]. They're also going to try to look out for [[Costi's mom|Sonia Grosu]]. They'll likely be closer to the gates, along with [[Costi's mom]] and [[Costi's Dad]]. 

[[Zephyra]] threatens [[Hugh|Finn]] with death if he reveals [[Niko]] and her are a thing. It sends weird vibes [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s way, she shrugs it off and plays like potentially amongst the world's best sets. Tears them down, makes them face their mortality, then turns into a "we're going to die young so kiss a cutie" bop. The place erupts in drinks and dancing, except [[Rez]], who sits in wonder staring. 

 [[Hugh|Finn]] DOES kiss a cutie, [[Terrav]]. And goes home with him. [[Niko]] let's slip that's been brewing for him since [[Arkhosia (City)]]. He owns up to his fling with [[Zephyra]], in a round about way. When he returns the question, she punts. [[Niko]] calls her out on it, but [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] calls his bluff. He goes to question [[Rez]] instead, she doesn't pick up on the subtext but when he pushes her is able to lie naturally well. He says, that's fine, I'll go shoot my shot then. [[Rez]] doesn't hide on that one quite as well, and both [[Niko]] and [[Zephyra]] seem to read her. 

[[Marius Lupu]] goes to say his goodbyes to [[Costi]]. It's a bit somber, until [[Costi]] brings up [[Rhynilex Svenik|Rhyn]]. Fuck that's cool. He then pivots to asking  what [[Rez]]'s deal is, [[Costi]] says to get in line but if he flatters her and then asks to have sex it'll probably work. They have a genuine goodbye though. 

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]], "It's Rez. Hi. Did you find out where the First will be? If the ELA were to blow up things, where should they? Deadline oops", she replies, "Unfortunately they're keeping it close to the vest since [[Dobosta Cumunzal]]'s escape, I have nothing I'd bet a bomb on." 

After a messy decision on what to send, [[Rez]] reaches out to [[Stulvorth Woolwalker]], "Unfforgedanately, we have nothing to report. Possible day of informant? You decide, last minute options? Probably best to plan for Stormwall flood site.", he replies, "HA! Yes, seems prudent. Thank you for your efforts, tell [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] to prepare another performance for victory party! Good luck, move in his light."

Morning comes, [[Terrav]] asks [[Finn]] to give a contact [[Ribola]] a charcoal sketch, they were friends. It's [[Arkhosia (City)]] day. 

We arrive in the [[Suncrest Palace]]. We decide to start with [[Henrik]], since he might be close, and then find [[Father Thronestone]]. [[Rez]] sendings him, "We're in AC! Where should we meet you? We are at the Palace but after an hour or so can head anywhere", he replies, ""

[[Henrik]] meets us as soon as we arrive, poorly hiding his reaction to seeing [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] again. They begin to catch up, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] is really thrown for a loop. He invites us to his office to speak, but confirms that [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is not in the city as far as he knows. 

In his office, [[Henrik]] shares some of the projects they've finally kicked off the ground in some of the poorer parts of the city. He shares their version of understanding of our work, [[ELA]] activity has increased, they suffered a major defeat recently, there was also the [[Orzudan Prisoner Breakout]], and a military coup is cooking. He asks if we need anything, when we say that trade relations may get better soon - he gives us a lantern that detects invisible sensors that will allow us to speak freely. 

[[Henrik]] thinks [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] is really going to make [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sweat it out, so he bets she'll have a year or two out before he comes back swinging. [[Henrik]] invites [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] back to the city for a better reintroduction, and will throw a party in her (our?) honor after we come back from [[Eberron]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] pivots to the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], and how interesting they are. [[Henrik]] notes it, but doesn't give anything away. He offers to give us what we need:

He give us:
	Sunburst pendant worth 100gp x2
	scroll of dawn
	superior hps, 3
	Lantern of Revealing

[[Rez]] tries to get a read on [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], who keeps a game face (as always) but the encounter has an undercurrent her being thrown for a bit of loop. 

[[Father Thronestone]] arrives, he's happy [[Henrik]] is living in [[Jalantar]]. He brings out [[Burru Ilp]]'s and the [[Unscaled]] notes:

* There were 11 sets of initials in the notes or from conversations with those involved:
	* B. I. - [[Burru Ilp]] - DEAD 
	* J. T. - [[Jorus]] Tolvint - DEAD 
	* Y. V. - [[Yhridex]] Vont - [[Durmask]], DEAD

* There's a place off of [[Yent Lake]], near [[Thelran Asari]] called [[Fenswick Cove]], where they keep sending scales and claws -- a few days SE of the city.
* They've been able to identify there's latent magic in body parts of a dragon, even once removed. They're augmenting magic with it. This research was led by someone else, perhaps off site
* [[Kelwin Gambletimble]] and [[Tunchon Agira]] were frequent sources

He also delivers a dagger made of copper pieces for [[Rez]] made by [[Divitston Goldstone]]. 

As we leave, [[Henrik]] gives [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] a supreme healing potion, telling her not to die again. He says [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] are incredible and made his life a lot easier, not that he ever expected to say that. 

Arriving back at the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]], [[Dania]] tells [[Hugh|Finn]] that she's ended up too busy
