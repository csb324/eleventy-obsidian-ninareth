# Detailed Notes: Session 143

We debate how to handle the soul jars. 

Leaving the area, we come upon a rollercoaster-style rail cart leading into the dark. The track is damaged, and cart is held in place by a stone. We assess the stability after it's damage from falling rocks, and decide to try anyway. [[Freya]] is going to use her climbing to tie a rope around it and try to reduce the momentum along the way. [[Samuel]] uses [[Costi]]'s magic to try and mend any of the worst looking spots. 

We go through some wild options and then basically decide to say fuck, with a speed-ceiling-climbing [[Freya]] to help lift our cart over missing track. We all pile in, and off we go. [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] is so in sync, we lean through curves, [[Hugh|Finn]] finds a steering apparatus (who could've known??), and we FLY through. The largest gap in the railing causes [[Freya]] to fall from the ceiling, but she gets to live out her skiing expertise. We pick up speed, and realize we never figured out how to stop... Guess that scroll of feather fall did come in handy. 

We land in the mining chamber of coal, this room is much darker than above. The room is covered in coal dust, bodies completely covered. We head to the collapsed footpath, make a tiny hut, and get a short rest. 

Agreeing to go try to free the water elemental, and hopefully interrogate them after, we look through [[Samuel]]'s eyes. On the walk, [[Costi]] brings up any use of fire is probably a very very bad idea. 

As we approach the water room, we're hit by a strong strong awareness of the smell and taste of blood. The soft sound of falling water, like that of a shower, calls out to us. There's 2 inches of blood coating the floor, filling the 30 ft room, and in the center is a blue sapphire dragon fountain, spewing bloodied water, surrounded by more tumultuous deep well, which is also coming down the walls. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] senses a strong undead reading from the fountain. 

We decide to chuck the water elementals soul jar at the statue, what can go wrong? [[Freya]] tosses it in, while [[Costi]], [[Hugh|Finn]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] all appeal to their gods. As it hits the statue, a blue petal comes out, the glass breaks, and a blinding light flashes. Slowly, slowly, the liquid turns from blood to water. A deep blue skinned woman with dark hair rises from the water, it's [[Shevashh]]. 

[[Bek]] translates. She thanks us, but isn't stuck here. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] asks her what she remembers, pain, fear, and many skeletons. Skeletons break, and take from her, and trapped her in the fountain. The skeleton had three heads, normal size (or as [[Costi]] referred to himself as little), carried a staff, and his heads fought with each other. We don't think this is a lich. Many other skeletons were melee fighter. They seemed like they both weren't from here, but also seemed perhaps new to the plane -- likely created not too far from here. She says we should help [[Jalene]], who she assume she needs help in the same way. She gives us 5 vials of pure water, we can drink it to restore one core part of you (a class feature, your spells, or your hit points) and it is restored. It will last less than a day. She gives us a [[tuning fork to the elemental plane of water]]. 

We sneak in to the room, looking at how to take it apart. [[Rez]] and [[Costi]] pry out some of the largest sapphires, getting 4 large sapphires, and pry off the wings (make it a lizard), that we strap onto [[Freya]]'s back. Each has about 40 sapphires. 

[[Costi]] takes a potion of darkvision, and casts an arcane eye to try and see which way to go. 

The eye first notes that there is a barricade to the entrance of dining hall 1. It is a bone white door, with an oversized skull embedded into the door, with black metal helm on it. It seems like it's perhaps sleeping? Continuing along the mining chamber, the door to the dining hall 2 has 2 skulls: one wearing a golden crown, the other coated in a silk hood, they're muttering to each other in something other than common. [[Costi]] mimics their mouths, [[Bek]] can identify it as an ancient goblin dialect. He says they're arguing about who used the last of the bone dust. [[Hugh|Finn]] recalls it is a common spell component in necromancy. They argue as though they're petty roommates. 

We decide it sounds more fun to try to pit the two heads against each other and take the long path. As we approach, they both turn their attention to us. The one with the crown says "halt" and asks who we are, as we come into his realm. They say we won't need skin once we pledge fealty and join their court. They say they have grand plans, and need 48,000lbs of bone dust. 

They say they'll let us in for the three things we hold most dear. They'll know.

When we say we'll go talk to other door, they start to panic and lie: he's racist, knows where our parents are, wait will destroy them, no make them powerful wizards! We leave.

We try to open the door of the sleeping head, but it immediately wakes and tries to bite [[Freya]]. Turns out he loves riddles. We swap a few, [[Rez]] shows off [[Rez's Riddle Machine]]. He loves it enough to let us in in exchange for it. [[Rez]] agrees, but says instead of leaving it with him, she'll give it to him in person. We ask how to tell the other version of himself of our encounter, he says "the General" commanded it. Pushed for more information, proof of our conversations, he said to mention [[Amarylis]] -- who they will never forget, their first kill. 

Entering into the dining room, a horrific site of 40 corpses pinned to the wall, arms out, legs dangling, skin flayed but pinned back to the walls. In 32, the central cavity reveals their bones have been removed. In the other 8, still no bones, but more noticeably, there's a spike in the center of their chest. 3 in particular with spikes catch our eye as they squirm out of their body, horribly broken and malformed. There's powerful arcane energy around these spikes. All 8 are different materials: oak, glass, coal, githyarti wood, sapphire, an unclear silver alloy, bronze, ruby. The githyarti, ruby, and silver alloy are the three currently growing skeletons. They are quickly growing skeletons, the ruby most accurately and quickly, though very malformed still. As it forms, we first see horror, then rage, before breaking. Inside the center of the ruby stake, see a very very thin purple core, tied to dunamancy. 

It's different, but reminds us of the undead creatures channeling magic in the [[Duvey Crypt]].
