# Detailed Notes: Session 100

Before bed, we write out our report for [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]]. We say we've found an informant in [[Shari's Boys]], but we're protecting their identity. We also planted a body part with them to try and track toward their headquarters. We also say we're tracking a few civilians that have raised our concerns, but there's nothing firm enough yet to report. We also include a basic daily schedule, and who all we've talked to. And ask for advice on connecting to [[Security Director Aldi]].

We discuss our unease of the [[Eberronian Military]] and the potential that a small group here is involved due to their dislike of [[Cliff Burbank|Cliff]] and the anti-necromancy. We plan to talk through how to handle this and the reports 

"Hello we need to meet at [[Ratoucha]], 8am or earlier. Meeting at 10 with others. Breakfast?", she responds, "Let's call it 8:30, a girl needs her beauty sleep."

The next morning, we head to the [[Ratoucha]]. We ask [[Trisha]] about their concerns with the local institution of [[Eberronian Military]], and after the normal platitudes, she reminds us we report to the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] and no one else. We specifically ask about [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim|Jalvena]], and [[Trisha]] shuts down all of our questions - it seems she wants to see what we're capable of without their help. She asks about our timing, and we hope we'll wrapped soon. She's going to escort us back to the [[Burbank Compound]]. She also tells us [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] came and went already, he was sorry to miss [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. 

We go to meet [[Garida]] at the [[Founding Flagon]]. On our way to wear the ambush took place, we don't see anyone watching the hotel or us. [[Freya]] tries to keep track of the route we take, but she's a little preoccupied by the new flora and fauna. On the way, [[Hugh]] spots a Game Warden keeping an eye out.

When we arrive, we see the overturned carts, blood spots and arrows - but all of the dead bodies are gone. We ask [[Garida]] if she was able to see the bodies of those that she traveled with, but she has not. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] pings a sense of undead on the edge of her awareness, we agree to check it out after looking at the scene. [[Hugh]] looks through the wreckage to try and piece together the attack - we're on a backroad game path. [[Garida]] says the manifest told them to take this path, but can't remember who they were delivering too. Interestingly, a lot of the arrows are on direct opposite paths, in a way that would be dangerous to those shooting. It's clear this was a planned ambush. 

[[Freya]] tries to read the blood patterns, but it's hard to glean anything. [[Costi]] looks inside the wagon, it was ransacked quickly and most everything was taken. We do find a strip of paper that looked like it might've been lost.

Scrap:
	GB - [[Oola]] 
	D. yellow - [[Agatha Krunderstone]]
	on the back, there's a blood splatter covering most of the writing but we get "...ner"

[[Garida]] recognizes it as part of the manifest. She thinks the blood splattered side would've been the cover page with instructions of where to go and who to bring it to, etc. We remember that one of the registered necromancers was named [[Zesnel Ponner]], maybe she was the target for the delivery? [[Costi]] thinks that it's a bit strange how it was torn and hidden, maybe it was left on purpose? 

Believing we've turned over the site, we head to 
Believing we've turned over the site, we head to the place [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] felt a undead ping. We all head that way, [[Costi]] pops out [[Samuel]] and they find a small amount of dust that is pulverized bone dust and bits of black fabric. It seems like it would take time to do, but maybe as though was someone was trying to hide it's existence. But it's a large amount. [[Garida]] says the fabric looks like what the attackers were wearing. [[Costi]] thinks it looks very similar to the shady figures he saw chasing us on the first night. We search the surrounding area for cave entrances, but don't seem to find any. 

We bring the wagon back to [[Viliki]], but the [[Eberronian Military]] guards take it as evidence and say they'll return it to [[Garida]]. We go back to the [[Ratoucha]] and ask [[Lara Frozenwatcher]] to secure us the guard routes and any addresses affiliated with the registered necromancers list. 

As we wait for that information, we decide to test to see if the mummy hand still locates where we believe [[Halv]] and the [[Shari's Boys]] safe house is - it still reads there.

[[Lara Frozenwatcher]] gets us the address of 3 out of the 4 necromancers: [[Sinan]], [[Zesnel Ponner]], [[Seshum Cinen]]. None of them are at the buildings when we drop by, so we decide to try the [[Eberronian Military]] facility. None of them are there, and none have been there in several days. We ask them to look if they've left town, and learn [[Sinan]] and [[Mim]] left together about 2 and half weeks ago, [[Seshum Cinen]] left 8 days ago, and [[Zesnel Ponner]] left a day and a half ago. Weird.

[[Costi]] send an arcane eye to [[Shay]]'s house. 4 people are sitting around playing cards, we start to think she's hired guards. Looking more closely at them, their armor and weapons don't seem to be super impressive quality, but they carry themselves confidently. We assume they're stronger than they put off. [[Hugh]] tries to scry to see where she is, but we can't lock onto her. 

[[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] pre-writes our report, details our trip with [[Garida]], notes the slip of paper, and our finding that the necromancers are out of town.

We head to [[Building 17]], [[Freya]] brings up a detect magic. She find magic on and beyond the door. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] sense that one of the guards inside is undead. [[Costi]] alarms the walkway. [[Hugh]] dispels effects on the door, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] dispels whatever was just beyond it. Through the eye, it seems like their suspicions are slightly raised. 

[[Costi]] goes to pick the lock, but triggers a mechanical alarm and shouts ow. Two of them seem to hear, but we charge in regardless. It's a difficult fight, but not terrible. Though it seems like they were so prepared for us, there's nothing incriminating in the house. A fire starts upstairs, starting in the back bedroom with the hidden cupboard.

The vampire turns into mist and zooms down the stone hidden passageway. We find a cipher on the body of the archer, and he has magical boots.

We decide to head down into the secret basement.
