# Detailed Notes: Session 109

We discuss who can create an ability to speak Kuo-Toa, and start to patch ourselves up before examining the room. We're in need of a rest, but aren't sure how to get out - we ask [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] to let [[Colvia Ghul]] know we're trapped. They can't send a message but can ask to be spoken to, and will be informed before hand. 

While [[Costi]] looks around the room, we argue with [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] about the need to torture the Kuo-Toa. You can guess who is on what side. [[Rez]] goes to looks at the cave-in to see if we can clear any material, but feels pretty confident that there's almost 70 feet of solid rock between where we entered, and also covers the way back towards where we saw the fork in the tunnel. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] looks at the tables where they were doing their work, and notice tubes and piping leading to work stations. They connect to a reinforced glass or crystal container of black ooze, which pass through some sort of carved gemstones, that are being infused into the weapons. He takes 6 vials of black ooze, 20 black tipped crossbow bolts.

[[Costi]] uses his ghostly gaze to see a hidden hollow piece in the corner of the room, with rolled bits of paper in it. There's also a weak section of wall, covered behind an illusion, with a small window inside. Looking through, he sees another tunnel with a stool and scrapped notes on the wall. There's no creature in the area however. He can't make it out, so assumes it's code or glyphs. 

He also finds a secret tunnel seemingly leading out of the area. 

Meanwhile, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] make a plan to interrogate the kuo-toa, and after agreeing to interrogation, the promise of pain, but a quick death and no torture, they wake it up with dizzit. It does not seem to respond to undercommon. After threatening it with some black ooze, it seems clear it only speaks fish language, and they knock it out to continue once [[Costi]] magically learns to understand what it's saying. 

Waking up the kuo-toa, [[Costi]] can understand he's clearly saying he doesn't understand. But learns that he can be understood. We do a ridiculous pantomime of a mute [[Costi]] understanding him, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] messaging his thoughts to translate, and [[Rez]] minor illusioning Pictionary to try and communicate. 

We learn he's from [[Mulfara]] and came into [[Eberron]] legally. The yuan-ti has been his boss for years. He's been here for longer than expecting, and is being paid. She had copies of their contracts. We decide to go search her body, and the others, before we continue. Most of the kuo-toa don't have much, some gold, and the casters have two staffs of forked wooden branches. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] recognizes that these are religiously affiliated, by the matching holy symbols they wear. However, in the yuan-ti's pouch there's a fragment of stone, like shale knocked off a larger stone. [[Hugh|Finn]] recognizes it might be a key to the hidden area. 

It perfectly fits, and avoiding a trap, he's able to pull out some paper. [[Costi]] reads it, noting it might be the first example of written kuo-toa, and summarizes. 

Lieutenant [[Irickson]] commissioned this weapons factory, and is overseeing it. The correspondence goes back about a year and a half, and in sum have created around 900 weapons. They've requested more ooze, and details the work of the tubes. In the hole there are three more of the glowy-green tubes that we found in the giant. Several have gone out from this area over their work. The various recipients are annotated by number. 

[[Jamzik Zodevzo]] says the name is familiar, and thinks it's maybe from the [[Eberronian First Division]]. If so, that would make a lot of sense. We realize that this might mean someone from that division was in the room accompanying, and [[Costi]] notes that it does look like someone very recently left. 

We decide to check out the hidden tunnel to see if it seems to meet where the overseeing room let out. We get a sense of if the two tunnels would intersect, and it seems like the hidden tunnel slants up, where are the exit from the room goes down. 

We try to follow the tunnel where the [[Eberronian First Division]] spy would've left, and after disarming some traps, track someone through a few multi branched tunnels, that are naturally within the stone. We walk for twoish hours, following their trail. Throughout our journey she undoes about 15 traps, some are familiar and some are new to her. 

[[Rez]] sneaks ahead and notices a layer of sod over the hole, but accidentally triggers the ground to break and slides backwards. We all make our way forward and find an abandoned campsite at ground level. There are 5 tents in the area. [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] recommends we investigate before bringing in backup, to ensure we don't get falsely blamed or beaten. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] search the campsite, and get the sense that people left here fairly recently but not immediately. More like three and half hours ago, around when we killed the giant. The tents are empty but not broken down, and left very quickly. We also note some footprints heading southwest, away from where our military group is moving in. 

[[Costi]] and [[Rez]] look around and notice a small orb, palm size, in the fire. It's giving off strong area of illusion. We find a [[Hallucinatory Orb]] which allows you can speak the command word and cast a condensed version of hallucinatory terrain where 100 feet around the orb looks illusory. It takes an hour to kick in but it lasts until you speak the command word again to change it / or unless it is moved more than five feet. [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] takes it, who seems to be loyal militarily but unconcerned with the ongoing politics. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] has the thought that this might instead be an [[ELA]] encampment and one of their spies instead of the [[Eberronian First Division]], but convey that to each other through message so as to keep our first line of thought in [[Jamzik Zodevzo]]'s mind. 

Once we fully investigate the site, we ask [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] if we should report this, and she says she's unsure because [[Colvia Ghul]]'s group has not responded, which is unusual. We decide to rest, but plan to move about a mile away so were not ambushed. Before we go, [[Costi]] gets [[Samuel]] back, and uses the ritual to try and leave written remnants in the fire pit as a warning. After some time, he send [[Samuel]] to bury some of the scraps in the other campsites fire.

The next morning, we try to get [[Jamzik Zodevzo]]'s advice on sending to [[Colvia Ghul]] as an update. She's a little spicy about it, and in general we get a feeling that she's moody about how their group was received by [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]], and is maybe protective of [[Colvia Ghul]]. 

[[Rez]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]] to message [[Colvia Ghul]], "HIDDEN FISH PLOT - followed trail, first division activity? South from target, woods. No current signs, hidden and waiting. You good? [[Jamzik Zodevzo]]'s worried, but won't admit", she responds, "Happy you're okay. After you left, six bullettes. [[Bez]] and [[Grizaf]] dead, behind schedule, more spread out than planned. Attacks across line, reorganizing strategy now."

[[Hugh|Finn]] casts locate creature to help us find [[Colvia Ghul]], and [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] heads in their direction. We do our best to be quiet, and try to avoid any attacks. It’s going well, until [[Hugh|Finn]] gets caught in a snare, and sets off an alarm bell. We blast him down and try to hide. Seconds later, we see crossbow bolts fly through the clearing, followed by some [[Eberronian Military]] soldiers. We hear two stones clacking together, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] seems to memorize the pattern, as though they were a percussion instrument.

[[Jamzik Zodevzo]] steps out and call the rest of us. He escorts us towards their leadership, saying we're in [[Fingers]] territory. One of her soldiers, Corporal [[Thurath]], says so much has changed we can only be read in at the campsite. As we arrive, it’s 6 or 7 units are here, and fortifications are being set up. There’s 10 people in stocks, looking bloodied. They’re soldiers, but we aren’t answered when we inquire about their crimes. 

Entering the tent, [[Fingers]] greets us and kicks everyone else out. We give her the update, describing almost everything, but leaving out our [[ELA]] hypothesis and the glowy cylinders. She has [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] note out things on a map. We ask what happened, and it seems like coordinated monsters attacked and thoroughly decimated many of the ranks, they say around 87 dead. They're worried about how forewarning would've taken place, we first ask about a mole, but it seems like perhaps [[ELA]] allowed their members to be captured to "give up" this information to lure the [[Eberronian Military]] into this area.

They're changing strategy, to work from a fortification and send out attacks. We're warned to not give credibility to the [[ELA]] forces. She replays through the conversation silently multiple times, and finally says she cannot find fault but must still punish us, as we were not with our group when it was attacked. She says [[Colvia Ghul]] will disagree, but [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] would be worse. So one of must spend an hour in the stocks, and [[Costi]] volunteers. 

[[Fingers]] remarks its not the first time she's put a [[Grosu]] in the stocks, but will take note that [[Costi]] volunteered, it shows leadership. She didn't serve with him long, but says he's the most incompetent soldier she encountered. She escorts him to the stocks, and we're encouraged to leave him alone. [[Rez]] leaves the parting thought in his head of "87 dead".

[[Hugh|Finn]] offers to talk through the grief with [[Jamzik Zodevzo]], but she declines as it's too early. [[Hugh|Finn]] gives her some mittens she knitted. They connect on it being tense, and it seems like [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] recognizes that [[Hugh|Finn]] has gone through a lot here. 

[[Rez]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] play games to pass the time. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] talks to [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] about [[Fingers]] relationship to [[Colvia Ghul]]. She encourages us to give [[Colvia Ghul]] the same update, and says the rest of [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]] team. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gives her the heads up that we have the skills to sort out those within an organization who don't serve it fully, but it doesn't seem like [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] has noticed anything. She says she only reports to her direct CO. She gives us the tip to cooperate, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] reverts our role back to loyalty to be a check and balance for the [[Eberronian Military]]. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] gets the read that things are tense but it's clear [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] wants to like us.

[[Hugh|Finn]] makes a show of needing some repairs to cast sending to [[Costi's mom]], "Offense seems successful. 87 dead. troops reorganizing. More defensive positions with scouts. (Our general position, estimation of troops in camp with us with remaining)". She replies, "thank you [[Hugh|Finn]] please keep updates coming"

[[Rez]] sends to [[Cliff Burbank]], "Tough day, I'm sure you've heard. First division, [[Irickson]], commissioned kuo-toa weapons factory underground. [[Viliki]] re-do?? Reported to [[Fingers]] and [[Colvia Ghul]]. Have contract, any requests?", he replies, "Seems like something is afoot! Got update from [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]. Just do what you're told. And make copies of everything for me. Be careful of [[Fingers]]"

Near the end of [[Costi]]'s time in the stocks, [[Fingers]] comes out to talk to him. She teases, ideates on more painful punishments, then cranks the barbs within the stocks for the last 5 minutes of the sentence. [[Hugh|Finn]] comes out at the end here and the conversation gets tense between the two of them. She gives him a handkerchief to clean up. 

[[Rez]] makes a copy of the kuo-toa contract, and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] goes to meet [[Costi]]. She helps clean his blood off of the stockades. [[Rez]] and [[Hugh|Finn]] swap sending updates. We all meet up back at the tent.
