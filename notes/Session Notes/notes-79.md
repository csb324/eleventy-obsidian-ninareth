# Detailed Notes: Session 79

We wake up, with 3 days before the [[Arkhosian Elections]] and for the first time, no crisis looming over our heads.

Over the next three days:

[[Hugh]] goes to the [[Temple of the Setting Sun]] and thanks [[TrueSilver]] for continuing to help give him purpose, giving an offering then casting a divination: "Are there any dangers we can expect in the days leading up to or during the elections?" As the flames burn [[Hugh]] sees a rumbling red line run through the flames, giving off a crackling energy that spurts right in the center, consumes the flame, and then comes back together. He also wants to talk to [[Magister]], he sendings to ask to dream. He says they can soon, it's difficult but he'll let him know. 

[[Freya]] wants to go to the [[Wayfinders]] and meet with [[Naya]]. The receptionist is in awe, named [[Soma]]. [[Freya]] doesn't quite pick up on it. In her conversation, she learns [[Naya]] was liasing with [[Victor]] on plans to potentially evacuate the city. It's not typical for [[Wayfinders]] to get involved in government work, but on a personal note she's thankful for [[Freya]]'s work. She also mentions a letter she recieved in her flight from [[Polaris]]. [[Naya]] turns very serious, and asks who else [[Freya]] has told, and what information. It turns tense, though not scary. She says she's been trying to do research into [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]]. She asked [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], who gave her [[The Unnatural Naturality]]. She took that book to [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]], who pointed us to [[Caleb Schleuse]], who eventually gave us [[Drimbias Shaziros]]. [[Naya]] says she cannot provide answers now, but warns [[Freya]] that she's safer the fewer people there are that know of her letter. She says soon her, [[Akros]] and [[Rawley]] can have dinner and discuss more. She discourages her from trusting anyone else, saying there's much that she doesn't know. She says that's "an advice, a request, and an order". She can talk to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] if it's an outlet for support, but she should tread carefully. She asks [[Freya]] to come back before we leave, they can have it ready in a week. Changing the subject, she shares there will be many people looking for travel out of [[Arkhosia (City)]]. 

Eventually, she owns up to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] about the conversation and says that we need to wait longer. 

[[Costi]] wants to shop, look for a scroll of mage armor, and grabs one at a discount from being recognizable. He also asks [[Neiragneg|Neir]] how he makes magic items. For him, it's looking at something and pushing his magical energy into an item in an hour, but for most people it's a lifetime of study to get there. [[Rez]] asks about destroying magical items, would saaaayyyy lava work? Sounds like small items maybe, but anything powerful probably not. This is bad news for us, [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], and [[The Gaze Grafter]].

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] also talks to [[Neiragneg|Neir]] about [[Rhend Triverswill]]. It seems like he's unemployed now, and [[Neiragneg|Neir]] covered up fro him at the [[TAI Committee]] because he's loyal. [[Hugh]] sendings to [[Ellinev Del]] to try and help him get a new job. We discuss his hopes that [[Rhend Triverswill]] still has a chance that he wasn't involved in the plan to hurt people. We riff for a while about where all of our "fuck you" line is to cut someone off. [[Rez]] suggest perhaps the [[The Silver Halves]], thinking [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] and [[Neiragneg|Neir]] could get along. 

[[Jade]] wants to sneak around the [[Suncrest Palace]], looking for symbols or reading through hidden messages in declarations. She also looks around for any hints of [[Tiamat]], but doesn't really find anything. She also will try to meet with [[Gaundon Skullmall]], who's busy until the [[Arkhosian Elections]]. Early next week, he'll take her and [[Hugh]] on a date to the [[Irralsil Spire]]. [[Jade]] asks [[Samuel]] what he thought of her zombie-[[Mandik]]. He seems unhappy, but agreed that [[Jade]] does not want to be smited by a god. She also goes to [[Halls of the Dead]], and is relieved not to be immediately pecked to death by ravens. She also tells [[The Curator]] that she's owed answers, an affirming tingle is an clue that might be coming. 

[[Rez]] shopping spree! Diamonds, [[Hugh]] comes with and we find 700gp worth! I also ask about the ioun stones that don't require work, no one's heard of it. Go meet and greet at the [[Platinum Sanctuary of Arkhosia]], while there she gets a letter addressed to "Copper Scale ([[Rez]]) (we didn't discuss names)", it's written in a super breakable code. Showing this to [[Jade]] and [[Costi]], they easily break it, finding It was dated about a week ago, and reads:

"Copperscale, I hope you like that nickname (code name). Also hey! I hope you're doing great. It's been pretty busy for me the last few weeks. Long story short, I'm off to [[Thelran Asari]]! I've uncovered some really incriminating information, there have been lots of developments. I didn't really have a chance to get you the information, but suffice it to say that I think there are folks pretending to worship [[Bahamat]] there and I'm going to go handle it. Also, I needed to get out of town, a couple of my plans went sideways. But don't worry about [[Thelran Asari]], I've got it under control! I hope you've taken care of your stuff as well, talk soon."

[[Rez]] and [[Jade]] talk about the potential hidden messages of the metallic and chromatic dragons in the [[Suncrest Palace]], and [[Rez]] asks her to write down whatever questions she wants answered. She immediately sends to [[Ghez Yhutl]], "Ghez! GREAT JOB. Are you discovered? Need ALL THE INFO. How're you getting to [[Thelran Asari]]? You can meet my sister there. Copperscales is PERFECTION.", he responds "Another operative - great. Contact please. Discovered kind of, plan went sidewise. Little bit wanted. Stowed away on airship. Arrived yesterday. Totally fine, [[Divitston Goldstone]] says hi", she responds: "Norris Park, that satyr fountain, tomorrow morning. Her codename is Silverscales. Tell her everything, and listen to what she says. Letters to [[Wayfinders]] in [[Quaath]]"

Sendings: [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], [[Vask]], [[Father Thronestone]], 

Are you safe? Heard you were arrested. If you need help use stone. Sounds like Ghent will break you out. If not, we will. Will send beer!", he responds: "Hey! great job, also to me. Stone confiscated. Talked to Gaunt, seems chill. Probably getting out soon. Where you at? I'll find you". [[Rez]] sends back: "Okay cool! We're at [[Suncrest Palace]], "Gotta tell Manville, by the way, things didn't work out. Also at the [[Suncrest Palace]], downstairs. Will tell Gaunt, think he'll let me out"

She sends a similar message to [[Terrav]]. He says "managed to maintain facade, did have to stab a few cops. But you know. Currently in holding, but safe. Thank you"

[[Costi]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]] to send to [[Niko]] *Chelsea add notes once Tim decides*

[[Neiragneg|Neir]] tries to find [[Rhend Triverswill]], looks to see if he's arrested. He doesn't seem to be (though [[Borum Galdsman, the 4th]], who got drunk and said that [[Rhend Triverswill]] was taking credit for a lot of "his work") but isn't at the [[Wyndlaâ€™s Wyvern]]. Turns out everyone he worked with isn't sure where he's gone. 

We all generally hear rumblings from people in the city. We're hearing special priase for the [[TAI Committee]], especially [[Ricci Scrucks]]. 

On the morning of the [[Arkhosian Elections]], [[Neiragneg|Neir]] finds a letter that reads, "[[Neiragneg|Neir]] I hope you've been well. I could use your assistance, currently in [[Quaath]], staying with a friend. You have tickets on an airship, departing every three hours for the rest of today. At your earliest chance, please board. I could use your help. P.S. The wyvern study can wait. But if you do have some spare time on the flight. P.P.S. please feel free to put any food or drinks you like on me. P.P.P.S. I hear you did excellent work on [[Delegates Day]]. Congratulations" 

[[Neiragneg|Neir]] talks to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] that he'll be heading to see [[Rhend Triverswill]]. We'll tell him we may be there soon. He's not sure what the legal situation is, but they'll sort it out. He thanks us for saving his life, and says goodbye.
