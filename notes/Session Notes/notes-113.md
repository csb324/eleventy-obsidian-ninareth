# Detailed Notes: Session 113

Tim is on notes duty while Rez sleeps forever.

[[Hugh|Finn]]'s 27 on insight tells us that the chime picked up on a lie of omission with regard to [[Costi]]'s comment of "no other interesting discussions with the ELA". [[Colvia Ghul]] seemed either disappointed or excited? We're left to chill in the tent which has abjuration magic.

Costi, using his Ghostly Gaze, finds out we're in a pocket dimension. Tim's opinion: it's probably one of those Mordenkainen spells. Adrienne identifies the table and knows that it produces food and water for 10 people every 6 hours. Apparently it takes requests. Freya asks [[The Curator]] about whether they know about this pocket dimension; they don't know about it.

We're in the tent for 3.5 days. Communication magic doesn't work. Costi succeeds on some book checks (2.5 questions worth). Freya gets stir-crazy and draws penises on a sleeping Rez. Adrienne successfully convinces the table to give us incense instead of food because we want to cast Legend's Lore (which uses 250g of incense). We now have 250g of incense but lack the necessary ivory strips (4 worth >=50g).

Finn divines asking, "Was our story believed?" In response, he hears "chimes tinkling and then cut off." Theories:
- Tim: Colvia didn't reveal the fact that the chimes went off at the end of our session
- Clara: They didn't believe us and plan to kill us

[[Colvia Ghul]] enters, apologizes, and lets us out. The tent has moved! We're in a larger encampment. Most of the battalion appears to be here. [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]], [[Fingers]], and [[9 Tails]] are all at the center of the camp standing next to [[Dispek Dradleston]] who is on a cross being whipped. [[Colvia Ghul]] joins them.

> Teld announces, "Now that we have the rest of the battalion, it is time to meet out just deserts. The lieutenant was given a task. The task was to root out terrorists seeking to destroy our country. He was given free reign to determine how this task was accomplished because of his significant experience.. his excellence in the field. The lieutenant failed. Hundreds are dead because of his mismanagement, his idiocy, and his incompetence." Fingers stomps her foot, and shields and feet from the join in time. Teld continues, "For the crime of incompetence, lieutenant, today I sentence you to death." Teld delivers a coup de gr√¢ce to [[Dispek Dradleston|Dradleston]], bisecting him with the creepy bone axe.

Colvia and Fingers seem pleased. Teld tells us that we would normally receive 6 months of time in a cell at least but because of the intelligence we brought back and Colvia's recommendation, we receive lashes. Receive 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 lashes but aren't briefed on all receiving lashes, so the order is Freya, Finn, Rez, Costi, Adrienne. The whip seems to use blood magic (Teld's blood) to be able to do double damage, which he uses against Finn only. The whip can't kill you and instead causes a level of exhaustion once you get brought to 1. Freya rolls a nat 1 to not Rage. Someone (Colvia or Curator?) tries to hold person her, but Freya doesn't Finn successfully casts calm emotions to stop Freya. Teld whispers something to Colvia, and Freya and Finn see a light turn on in Dradleston's eye and his hands twitch. They destroy his soul.

We're taken to a tent. Wounds won't stop bleeding (we were told not to heal them and that the wounds wouldn't heal on their own). Colvia hesitated before she left, and Adrienne noticed that Colvia maybe wanted to say something else but held it back. We lick our wounds for 30 minutes waiting for Teld to call on us. Colvia picks us up and takes us to a small, wooden building containing the remaining leadership. Finn notices that Fingers has an additional stripe on their uniform.

Colvia debriefs us on the campaign through the ravine. Freya insights (21) and gets no "untoward vibes" from Colvia. They captured prisons but let them escape with detailed information on the camps. The prisoners were tailed and left to leave information at a dead drop and then captured again. The 8th division is leaving a trap. Two locations expected to be attacked, and we'll be in one. Fingers is now in charge of us as we're being put in the vanguard. Finn talks back to Teld and gets whipped again. 

Fingers walks us over to our campsite. On the way there, Fingers tries to give Finn advice about not getting the rest of the party killed via insubordination. Finn doesn't take the advice. The campsite looks poorly guarded; we were maybe put here to do. Adrienne tries to go to Colvia to talk about something, but Fingers warns Adrienne that Colvia's "bite is worse than her bark." Fingers reveals that Colvia is more of a consultant, not really in the 8th. ~"Don't believe that she's your friend." Adrienne wants to go anyway and brings Costi.

Adrienne tells Colvia, in broad strokes, about Willow (very zone of truthy though). Colvia says she'll keep this as between us as she can. Adrienne gets vibes that Colvia isn't a friend but maybe that her persuasion worked?

Freya talks to Finn about losing control and tries to get Finn to tell her it's OK to make a deal with [[The Curator]] to get control over her rages. Finn recommends breathing exercises seeing through the ploy. Finn says its not worth it. Freya asks Finn to kill her if he has to, "It's not killing me if I ask you." They go back and forth on Freya getting everyone killed. Finn asks unironically why Freya "always puts other people's lives above her own." Freya beseeches the rest of the party. We all agree that *if our options are somehow kill Freya or everyone dies, we kill Freya* (but obviously there almost definitely be better options).

Costi asks Finn that maybe it would be better to not do that again with Teld. Finn explains that he has felt 9 tales ~200 times, and that it's hard to control himself.

Finn and Costi go to Rez to "tend to her" since she is responding badly to the whipping. Finn sneakily (25 stealth) sends to [[Devkorus Kaa]], "Army expecting attack (left and right sides of camp). Fell for planted information. Attack will maintain cover. Drop locations compromised. 500 tropps remain in camp. Advice?" Response: "Understood." What a dick (the dick being Joe).

Adrienne talks to Fingers about what the protocol is re us healing when we're attacked. We learn that we were going to be healed before we go to bed, but the conversation in the Tent changed that.

Freya tries to do tree stuff to get closer to nature and does a bad job. Where she touches the tree little dead spots appear.

We rest successfully but don't heal.

Adrienne helps around the camp and does some snooping at the same time. Adrienne finds a lot of divining and anti-divining spells (see invisibility, counterspell, nondetection, etc...). They have 100s of spell scrolls, mostly low level but a lot of cloud kill spell scrolls. Colvia has made a least a few of them, including a 6th level scroll of Chain Lightning.

Costi goes looking for interesting stuff in the dead bodies. He does a great job but finds nothing (deciding not to plant evidence). Interestingly, the diversity and volume of monsters would require a fortune to acquire.

Finn cooks poorly and freya does manual labor.

Teld comes by, inspects our wounds for a long time, and gives us the OK to heal to half.

Adrienne talks to Freya about the anger thing. Freya says "a little before" the fighting pits, she started giving into it more. Costi and Adrienne help Freya with tree things, and she doesn't cause it to die (though no other good things happen). Costi reads the book and gets a 3rd question.

[[Jamzik Zodevzo]] gives us a balm that numbs some of the pain but doesn't break the rules.
