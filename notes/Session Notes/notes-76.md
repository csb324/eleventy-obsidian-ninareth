# Detailed Notes: Session 76

We wake up to a formal invitation from [[Willen Guruden]] requesting our presence 2 hours before the [[Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser]]. 

We introduce [[Neiragneg|Neir]] and [[Jade]], and after they meet each other and swap what rumors they've heard of each other, we start to talk about the role [[Rhend Triverswill]] is playing in the conflict. [[Neiragneg|Neir]] believes he's being mislead and is a good person (if a bad boss). We try to learn if we could get information out of him, either through [[Vask]], or [[Neiragneg|Neir]]. We struggle to find a good option. 

We talk about if we should go to the [[Refinery]] to talk to [[Arjun Desmond]] but get distracted.

We break for a moment to look at the ruby that replaced the [[Dunamantic Ruby Eye]], [[Rez]] sees that it looks like waste almost, it's a fine stone but very poorly cut. 

Then [[Jade]] asks [[Neiragneg|Neir]] what he knows about necromancy, then gives him the update on the [[Mirror of Life Trapping]] and [[General Ilka Korsas]]. [[Hugh]] says he told [[Magister]] and [[Victoria Several|Victoria]] is interested in helping. 

We start to talk about what we need to do in advance of the [[Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser]], and [[Freya]] mentions needing to buy potions. We then start to debate how we'll accomplish all our various goals. [[Jade]] wants to watch the [[Giary]] pitch to [[Niko]], [[Costi]] wants to kidnap [[Niko]] (hopefully with his consent), [[Hugh]] wants to know what [[Cut]] and [[Niko]] are doing, and be there for [[Pruvki Forgaveat]]. [[Freya]] wants to get as much information as possible.  

We decide not to kidnap him, and just hope for the best with [[Giary]]'s pitch. We agree to do what we can to boon him. Someone might need to be with them to help that conversation, either [[Rez]] or [[Costi]] depending on circumstance. [[Hugh]] will try to make [[Giary]] more presuasive, and need to prep him with the warning not to let [[Niko]] know we are involved. 

We will try to tail both of them, working around the [[Giary]] conversation. [[Neiragneg|Neir]] will go invisible and try to follow [[Cut]] to learn what he is doing. [[Costi]] will tail [[Niko]], using the [[Cloak of Elvenkind]] and will borrow knowledge to be more perceptive. [[Jade]] will use this time to try to watch [[Gaundon Skullmall]] eat cheese. 

We plan to chat with [[Giary]] today to give him the heads up and also ask if he can get himself into the [[Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser]]. [[Hugh]] sends to him, "Meet at [[Raptur's Nest]], we need to chat. Itâ€™s about [[Niko]]. Dinner?", he responds, "Yeah sounds good". [[Hugh]] also sends to [[First Officer Ghent]] to coordinate our report, "We need to report. Have some meetings during the day. Around bedtime?" he responds, "I would also appreciate an opportunity to share information".

We split up to go shopping: [[Rez]] and [[Costi]] are going to buy scrolls, [[Freya]] and [[Hugh]] will go sell some monster parts and buy potions, [[Jade]] and [[Neiragneg|Neir]] will go buy cheese. Before we leave, [[Neiragneg|Neir]] first breaks apart his crossbow and creates something new with his boots, magically giving him the opportunity to teleport. It reminds us of [[Ellinev Del]]. 

[[Hugh]] asks [[Neiragneg|Neir]] if he's heard of [[Moradin]], and we get spun off on a analysis of racism and their gods. [[Jade]] seaks of yuan-ti and if their history is full of cults or if it's just revisionist history. [[Jade]] shares about her background and friends to catch [[Neiragneg|Neir]] up to speed. 

Team scrolls gets alarm, see invisibility, and detect thoughts, and some more parchment for [[Costi]]. Team cheese very thoroughly interogates their options and gets cheese. [[Freya]] and [[Hugh]] sell the monster parts for 200, and gets a [[Potion of Rage]] which last for 1 min. 

We meet up at [[Flyte]] and catch up quickly before going in. It's very popular inside, and high-end. We don't recognize any patron but see an older human man with a neat gray bun and beard behind the bar - it's [[Varras]]. [[Freya]] recognizes that he's subtly watching us as we enter. [[Rez]], [[Jade]], and [[Freya]] approach the bar. We get a number of drinks, including the afforementioned apple cider. [[Jade]] notices the spacing is a little weird, and starts to puzzle it out at a table. [[Neiragneg|Neir]] goes into the bathroom to cast detect invisibility, and [[Costi]] joins to cast detect thoughts. While he's there, he looks into the kitchen and see normal chatter and a staircase out. As [[Neiragneg|Neir]] returns he's able to help [[Jade]] see that acid would reveal some hidden characters. We pocket the lemon, and [[Costi]] starts searching thoughts. [[Varras]] disses [[Costi]]'s cloak is conspiciuous but looks cool. On his way back to our table he randomly just pops in to a few other patrons. The last mind he goes into, is deeply nervous, triggered by seeing [[Costi]]. He's a halfling in okay fancy clothes, but seems normal. 

As we chill and be 'normal', [[Neiragneg|Neir]] sneaks behind [[Freya]] to sprinkle the lemon juice over the receipt. He quickly puzzles through the cipher, and unscrambles them to read "Day after tomorrow, 6 AM, Museum. We start there", signed by [[Srictha]]. We have the beginnings of our [[Fire Raiser Attack in Arkhosia City]] plan. 

Our group heads back to the hotel to meet with [[Giary]], and passes the time until he comes by getting to know [[Neiragneg|Neir]] better through a classic game of What the Fuck is Up IS That? [[Costi]] decides to start off with [[Rez]], asking her about how her dad got the wealth her family has. She admits that yea, they have a lot of money. He got it over time, and by being an adventurer and diplomat. His name is [[Zair]], but no one in the party has heard of him.

[[Rez]] asks about [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]], and if she's worried about the people connected if it's how she's going to get home, if they're maybe tied to the [[Halls of the Dead Necromantic Chapel]]. She's a little concerned, but how bad could it really be? I mean, bad if it's them, but maybe it's not. [[Caleb Schleuse]] wasn't bad, so it's something she wants to wait and see. 

[[Freya]] asks [[Neiragneg|Neir]] while he still works for [[Rhend Triverswill]] if he's treated so badly. He says he was in [[Mulfara]] and having a bad time, when he met the Professor he helped him get out. Now he has freedom and can help him get money back to his family. 

[[Neiragneg|Neir]] asks [[Costi]] about [[Samuel]] and why? He came through the Find Familiar spell, but is a little different. [[Costi]] thinks he may be connected to [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]], becuase he's paired to his sword and hangs around. Plus he's [[Our Fiend Samuel]], according to [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]. [[Samuel]] shows his displeasure of having the secret going to [[Neiragneg|Neir]], but is bought off with a beetle. [[Costi]] also talks about his tie to [[The Raven Queen]], and that he's still trying to figure that out. 

[[Costi]] asks [[Jade]] about [[The Curator]] and their interaction with [[Costi]]. He wants to know if they're mad at him. And also what's in [[Jade]]'s head that they claim. She says she's been wanting to find out answers on this too. She says that [[The Curator]] sees through her glasses ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]), but seems to be a roommate within her brain. It's much harder to communicate with them when they're off.  [[Rez]] asked if they met the same way that [[Rez]], [[Freya]], and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] did? It sounds different, they came to [[Jade]] in her sleep, and they struck a deal on working together in their first conversation that led to their current relationship. 

[[Jade]] asks [[Hugh]] about his experience in [[Zilvengrod]] and them setting him on fire. She feels like he should be more upset, and wants to know if it feels like a cult to him. [[Hugh]] says he's not sure, what is the difference? [[Jade]] and [[Neiragneg|Neir]] both received anti-cult training in [[Mulfara]], and she describes hurting people. [[Hugh]] says he was not viewed as person, or regarded well by the poeple there. [[Rez]] asks how [[Moradin]] is supposed to be good if he gives power to people who aren't good? [[Hugh]] says he'll have to ask one day. 

At that point [[Giary]] makes his way in, and introduces himself to [[Neiragneg|Neir]]. When [[Hugh]] gives [[Giary]] his food, [[Costi]] asks [[Neiragneg|Neir]] if he's ever worked with warforged. When he says he's mildly familiar, [[Costi]] suggests he try to help him get his taste, so [[Neiragneg|Neir]] tries. He draws a schematic and says with time he might be able to think about it and help later.

We ask if [[Giary]] can get himself into the [[Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser]] and he's extremely confident. He's going to jump a waiter, and then he'll go where we tell him. He's working on his speech, but doesn't want to share with us what's in it. We make it clear that he can't connect to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] while talking to [[Niko]]. He feels like it's covered, but we agree to meet up at the party so [[Rez]] and [[Hugh]] can help boon him up. [[Rez]] warns that [[Costi]] might have to be around, just to help, and he says that's fine as long as he covers his ears. [[Costi]] promises. [[Giary]] asks to stay the night, and we agree. [[Costi]] lasts maybe 5 minutes before going to apologize to him about lying. They reach a real agreement, but says that he understands he needs to listen for safety, and [[Giary]] agrees, so long as he never tells anyone. 

[[Jade]] remembers that [[First Officer Ghent]] is stopping by, so we tell [[Giary]] that we will have to make him a goldfish. 

[[Hugh]] asks what he shuold divine over, and [[Rez]] suggests we try to stop the [[Cloud's Lament]]. [[Giary]] says it docks at 4:45, which is the same time as the [[Ichlior-Guruden Fundraiser]], so we resolve to just mention it to [[First Officer Ghent]]. He recognizes [[Neiragneg|Neir]] on sight. He says [[Rhend Triverswill]] is an agent of the [[Slavaadi College]] and a powerful illlusionist. This panicks our new friend, and we all empathize.

[[First Officer Ghent]] gives us an update on [[Dharbeed Tzaavi]], they new he was dirty but were finally able to get him helping smuggle convicted folks get our of [[Arkhosia (City)]]. The [[Chasing Daylight]] was one such group of bad people, and now they're all put away. 

We share all of our updates, and he says he'll get some covert operatives help unload the [[Cloud's Lament]] to see what's there and track where those shipments go. We tell him we have our own operatives, and give him the number 4. He wants the exact addresses or people to tail. We share that [[Cut]] will be one of the site leaders. 

[[First Officer Ghent]] says that he thinks our plan is the best possibility there is. [[Rez]] expresses concern on the four separate attacks. He suggests we tackle one, our [[Fire Raisers]] dissidents handle another, and his team can try to take the other two. 

[[Rez]] asks if [[Ichlior]] sucks as much as we do. He evades, and when pushed he says that we should prioritize getting closer to the [[Fire Raisers]] so they trust us with more information. That's our main operational goal. 

[[Freya]] asks for [[my hole]] back, it's being analyzed by his team, and she stresses that *operationally* it would be helpful if we get it at our next check-in. [[First Officer Ghent]] will do what he can to expedite it. 

Nothing to do with [[Neiragneg|Neir]], we share the [[Arjun Desmond]] contact at the [[Copper Foundry]]. He says he'll look into and also double the tail on his recently fired intern, [[Borum Galdsman, the 4th]]. He's been drunkenly sharing a lot of information. 

[[Jade]] asked about [[Gaundon Skullmall]]. He's a notable [[Zilvengrod]] metal artisan, mostly making weapons, he's a conservative activist and close to several Conservative members of [[The Circle]]. [[Hugh]] remembers [[Skullmall Industries]] which is one of the largest weapons manufacturing groups. They're known, in particular, for their bludgeoning weapons. He typically has about 5 people with him. [[Rez]] asked if he's lactose intolerance, they say no but he is allergic to most poultry. 

Before bed, [[Hugh]] divines, "How can we best convince [[Niko]] to abandon his violent tendencies and his current path". Holding his holy symbol, he sees a silver almost platinum line makes it's way through the fire, a thin round shape with a pointed end, like a knitting needle, as it touches one of the coals at the bottom, it shimmers and then flames begin to build out around it. They then melt down, into liquid almost like blood, and then came out away from the fire coming out towards [[Hugh]] and ending in what looks like the curve of a bow. 

We talk about what that might mean. Potentially the impact of [[TrueSilver]] spreading out to influence people. Or potentially the cycle of violence starting with impacting one and rippling out in blood to others. We're not sure what to make out of it. 

Before bed, [[Costi]] adds the new spells to his book. [[Rez]] uses the [[Circlet of Sending]]. [[Neiragneg|Neir]] works on his 'masterpiece' of cheese banana.

Right as we're laying in bed, we feel a tremor shake us. Not seeing anything out of the window, [[Samuel]] flies up and can see the red fires of explosions throughout the city. A couple dozen fires are, upwards of 30, all throughout the city. 

The closest is about 10 minutes away, and we immediately head that direction. On the way [[Rez]] sendings to [[First Officer Ghent]], "Just saw the damage, over 30 we see. How can we help? Should we help? We can't just sit here. We're heading to the nearest". He responds, "Believe 36. No. Stay in. So far, largely minimal casualties. One exception. Private residences, second homes. Will update more tomorrow."

As we approach, the guard shoos us off, and brushes off all attempts to ask questions. [[Hugh]] and [[Freya]] try to subtly see any hints of the [[Fire Raisers]] tactics. They notice this is a very fine residential facility, but there's no medical assistance or people needing help. The area around the house is heavily dampened, soaked through in advance of the bombing so that the fire woud not spread. It's already out and just a column of smoke now. [[Jade]] talks to a peeping neighbor, and we learn that this residence is of a sergeant in the guard, [[Dohlfursted]]. They express support for [[The Guardians]], and having a larger majority in response to this rise in crime. 

On the way back, [[Rez]] worries about [[The Miscasts]]. She just used the [[Circlet of Sending]], so she asks [[Hugh]] to reach out to [[Lorian]]. He says "Are you safe in [[Arkhosia (City)]]? Meet us for breakfast tomorrow morning at [[Raptur's Nest]]", he responds, "What a night. Yes to both, alll three questions. Yes. Sure. Good to hear from you"

We go to bed, and when we wake we find a paper slid under our hotel room door. "36 total bombings, outside of 1, 4 casulaties. Outside 1 bombing, at [[Corner 12]], at [[Dragon's Hide|Hidesman]] welcome event, 118 dead".
