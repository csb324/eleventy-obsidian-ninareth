# Detailed Notes: Session 139

We wake up, ready for our first day heading into the [[Turian Waste]]. The [[Eberronian Military Third Division]] escorts us through the border wall, leaving through door 36. 

The colonel of this division, [[Colonel Dardenev]], is similar to [[Cliff Burbank]] as two of the most important military figures. 

We're heading to the [[Gu’athrithen]] mine, [[Zhakastin Expedition]] about 35 miles north of the border, where the unexplained mass casualty event took place. 

[[Rez]] warns [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] to watch for things flying above and things in the sands below. 

About three hours into our travel, we feel rumbling in the ground, and [[Rez]] tells [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] to stop. While freeze, hoping the creature passes under us, we hear the sounds of conflict a small distance away. Something else got caught. [[Costi]] sends an arcane eye, and sees 3 large misshapen stone elementals fight some draconic creatures, which he's able to see are undead. The seem to be intelligent, and more capable than ordinary skeletons. The skeletons ultimately win out, though only leaving 2 'alive' from the original 7.

We hide as they begin walking south, [[Costi]] decides to keep an eye out and we continue moving into the [[Turian Waste]]. We're making surprisingly good time. At the end of the hour, it seems like they're heading to the [[Slavaadi College]] border. 

We decide to make camp for the night, [[Costi]] makes a hut. [[Freya]] takes the [[Circlet of Sending]] to send to [[Dahana]], "[[Dahana]] - hi. It’s [[Freya]]. I bet you weren’t planning to hear from me. How are you and [[Polaris]]? I’ve been thinking about home. Anything new? So…", she replies, "[[Freya]]! Hi, no, I wasn't expecting to hear from you. I'm well. But, is it wise for you to be reaching out? It is good to hear".

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] discusses her response, and in particular the role of [[Ronan]]. [[Hugh|Finn]] finally breaks the news that he thinks [[Ronan]] and [[Petra]] are married, due to the fact that they're both wearing rings. [[Freya]] asks why [[Hugh|Finn]] didn't share this earlier.  

[[Rez]] sendings to [[Petra]], "I can't get you, your drive, vigor, passion out of my head... Are you married? Tell me who -- name my competition. Give me a chance!!" she replies, "…[[Freya]]’s dragony friend? Wow, this is…unexpected. I was…struck…by your beauty, despite your questionable taste in friends. Bring [[Freya]]’s head, I’ll reconsider [[Ronan]]…"

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] takes watch, [[Hugh|Finn]] going first, when [[Rez]] is awoken by a burning on her arm - her bracelet says "[[Zoheret|Zoha]]". She gets a sending from [[Zmaj]] shortly after, confirming she was killed going after [[Bhula Orbnose]]. 

Finn comforts her, though she's not ready for much comfort yet. 

Adrienne wakes for her watch, and tries to talk about it, offering help. [[Rez]] confides in her some -- but makes it clear, she's not sorry, she's angry. She sends to [[Vask]].

rez to the group in the morning tells them what happened, sharing that she keeps secrets to protect her family, but they know that there are people trying to systematically kill [[Rez's Family]]. Finn asks why, she says the most fucked up part of it is it's just unearned prejudice -- but it's past the time to try and correct them, the only option is for them all to die. She says there may come a time when she asks for [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]]'s help, things have changed - they've learned to use [[Rez's Family]]'s magic against them. 

Everyone is ready to lend a hand, and offers to have her go now - but [[Rez]] says this is maybe equally important. 

We make excellent time resuming our journey, noticing after a while there's two elemental-feeling spirits following us, but they don't seem to be attacking. They trail behind us. We continue to progress but keep an eye on them. 

When nothing escalates, we decide to 'take a break' to see if they'll approach so we can learn more. The pause allows [[Hugh|Finn]] to overhear that they are whispering.

When nothing escalates, we decide to 'take a break' to see if they'll approach so we can learn more. The pause allows [[Hugh|Finn]] to overhear that they are whispering. [[Costi]] decides to just call out and say, "I can hear you talking, who are you?"

They pause, and [[Costi]] negotiates with them as they ask if we're undead. Two tiny beaked winged creatures appear, they're mephits, [[Bek]] and [[Shraule]]. They say they've only been here for a couple of decades (through a hole in reality by their boss). It dissolves briefly into 

They say they worked in the mine, and a few weeks ago it was overrun with undead. They had been working with [[Gu’athrithen]] draconics under a dao woman named [[Jalene]] and the leader of the mines, [[Katrik]]. A group of undead, they guess fifty or sixty, were lead by a very chatty (constant chattering, maybe seemed nuts) skeleton creatures with a shiny staff - did big magic. They want us to help save their boss. They'll show us around, help us avoid traps. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] puts a little pressure on, they say they can show us were some extra gems are kept in the mine. 

Reading them, it seems like they truly just want our help, couldn't care about us at all. They're do their best to assist us, but they're not going to lavish us with praise. 

There's another rift to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] in the mine, but the undead came from the top with the [[Turian Waste]]. 

[[Costi]] thinks about what he knows of liches -- they are extremely extremely rare, the amount of magic required is almost impossible to attain, especially since the age of [[The Second Sundering]] and magic returned back to it's normal power levels. He has not seen record of any lich currently existing in [[Ninarith]]. 

We agree to a deal, and they get working on a little bit of information they can give us in advance. They assume most of what they killed to be turned as well. 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] plus the mephits heads to the entrance of the mine, to do a bit of recon and decide where we're going to try to rest. On the way we see what seems to be another site of an elemental vs undead battle (the draconics lost). They say it's mostly quiet outside of the cave except for 15 draconic heads on spikes with bloody writing on the walls, though they couldn't read it. 

[[Hugh|Finn]] tries to scry on [[Jalene]] but the spell doesn't work. He also gives a status update to [[Sienna Burbank|Sienna]]. "Check-in. At mine. Found mephits who are helping us inside. Former miners. Expecting a lich? Hole to [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. Going in tomorrow." She replies, "Lich? None should exist, will research. Do not engage a lich, repeat, if it’s a lich do not engage. But do explore, back ASAP." [[Hugh|Finn]] doubles down, "Will try not to engage. You know how that is. Going in to help any remaining survivors. Mephits clearly described a lich. Will check in if able". She is worried in her response, "Cannot stress strongly enough: You are unprepared to fight lich. You will die. Do not engage lich. Could be multiple other kinds of advanced undead."
