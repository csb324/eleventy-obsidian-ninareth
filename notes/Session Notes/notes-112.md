# Detailed Notes: Session 112

We know it is a decent amount of time to camp, so we stealth through the woods to try and avoid detection by [[ELA]] or any of it's loose monstrosities. 

As we walk [[Hugh|Finn]] detects a rumbling underground heading towards us, and we all quickly scatter and jump into action. Two bullettes burst from the ground each being ridden by two medusa's. Then a group of undead approaches, seemingly not in league with the monstrosities. 

Several of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] ends the combat in the beginning stages of petrification. [[Hugh|Finn]] figures out he's able to heal them, and does so. Then he and [[Freya]] dissect the medusa and bullettes, getting some sellable parts. [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] look at the undead, and it's clear they're all wearing the same armor, some having broken ankle chains, but they have [[Eberronian First Division]] sigils. [[Costi]] looks at the tunnels and they seem similar to [[ELA]] with nothing of note. 

On watch, [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Rez]] chat about a sending to [[Starstool Daygrip]] to get some info out of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] hopefully. "Hope things worked for [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]] in [[Ru'Nileth]], tough crowd. Favor, [[Rez]] loves necklace - wants to commission more name of jeweler? Then coffee. Good luck." They reply, "Very successful trip! Commission is challenging, scale one of a kind. Made through [[Driega Jolentia]] in [[Durmask]], she's brilliant. Coffee, yes, in [[Jezeten]] perhaps?"

[[Rez]] tells [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] a bit more about her dream from [[Eirian|E]], and mentions [[Home]] and that this new guy named [[Samson]] knew [[Sezathkathon]]'s name. She also share the update about [[Pleetos Alentas]]. She say she'd like to go to [[Thelran Asari]] and [[Durmask]] if we get a chance. 

We also talk about if Finn can scry on people he doesn't know, which he can but it's tough. [[Freya]] says she's interested in using it for [[Ronan]], and [[Rez]] asks about [[Pleetos Alentas]]. [[Costi]] reads [[Kith and Kin]]. 

After our chats, we head back in the woods towards camp. On our way, about 3 hours from where we slept, we find several manticores hung in a tree. [[Hugh|Finn]] hears a slight rustling from the left. [[Samuel]] doesn't see anything, so [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] drums the code signal of the [[Eberronian Seventh Battalion]] but gets no response. We keep on the road. Hearing the sound again, [[Freya]] makes a whole bit that reveals a laughing [[Jamzik Zodevzo]]. 

She was tailing us, but says we're close to camp now. We learn she's had her own form of tough discipline, had her foot skinned after stepping on a branch and giving away an ambush. Eventually, we arrive back and are escorted by [[Colvia Ghul]] and 20 other soldiers. It seems like she's legit very excited to get some details to help turn the tide, and keep her successful. 

She pulls [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] into a tent for a private chat, added by some chimes of truth-telling. After reading our information, she calls [[Jamzik Zodevzo]] in. They have some sort of conversation through message, takes the papers, and winks.
