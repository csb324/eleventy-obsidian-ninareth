# Detailed Notes: Session 87

We wake up, and briefly plan to go explore the tunnels - aiming for finding the spot the necromantic goo is appearing. But first, we need to go get [[Rhynilex Svenik]]. She's clearly working out, and a flustered [[Costi]] offers to train with her. [[Hugh]] gives her the scarf that he made, she likes it but tries to hide it from us. They spare, [[Costi]] trying his best to seem cool, and is extremely persuasive. They're saving their energy for later... you know, to TEST each other more fully. 

As we begin our journey, we fill [[Rhynilex Svenik]] in on our thoughts that the Day of Songs is the timeline we need to be at the anchor tree, which is coming up. We decide to take the more direct but more dangerous route, sneaking to hopefully pass around any unfriendlies. 

On the road, [[Jade]] teaches [[Rhynilex Svenik]] a bit about gender equality for men - she's perplexed. She says [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] will need to determine who is legally in charge of [[Costi]], as he's a man. We lean on [[Hugh]]'s genderfluid identity to his advantage. [[Rez]] is selected for her ability to talk him out of it. [[Freya]] helpfully asks if [[Rez]] can boss him around now. It's a thought!

[[Freya]] watches to be sure we stay on our route, [[Hugh]] keeps an eye out for notable features or threats. [[Samuel]] is sent ahead to scout when [[Costi]]'s [[Raven's Edge]] begins to hum. [[Samuel]] has pulled back a little bit of stone to find a fairly fresh store of shells and carapace that seems to be recently discarded and then hidden. [[Jade]], [[Rhynilex Svenik]], and [[Freya]] recognize this as a bulette shell. [[Rhynilex Svenik]] directs us to a hideaway, and plans to scout and be sure it's gone. We convince her to take [[Samuel]] too. 

She says she led the bulette away and trapped it in one of [[Izdeke]]'s pens. We restart our journey and head downwards. [[Hugh]] forages some phosphorescent moss. We approach the chamber where they find the necromantic goo concentrated. Right before, an eight-legged creature falls onto [[Costi]] from the ceiling. It seems to attach to him in a concerning manner - we're able to pull it off of him, and make short work of it. We quickly look it over, it doesn't seem to have any grafting on parts, and we're able to cut out some parts.

In the center of the room, there's three large pools of ichor, two 10 ft in diameter and one centralized one is much larger. They flash on [[Jade]] [[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]. [[Costi]] investigates it with his Ghostly Gaze. It turns his vision black and as he looks through the largest pool, he's able to see straight through it and into the rock below. Inside the liquid, about 20ft down, a creature with four short stubby legs attached to a brain -- with an eye embedded into it. 

It's a brutal brutal fight, we struggle but eventually kill the undead creatures that crawl out of them (there's a lot), and with all of our help [[Costi]]'s sword clears away the goo in one of the areas, leaving a long dark pit. [[Rez]] uses her song of creation to build a grate on top of the other pits, and we try to have [[Costi]] clear out the rest of the goo. As he approaches the last one, he hears a voice in his head say "Think twice about this boy", but he's able to overcome it hearing, "You'll regret this [[Constantine]]" and he replies "IDK, seems like I'm winning!" After some investigation, the goo remains but is about 300 feet down, and the walls are almost unnaturally straight - like they were cut with a razor. 

As we short rest, we debrief. [[Rhynilex Svenik]] is impressed with us. We keep some of the intellect devourer bodies that have been grafted onto. They're pets of Ilithid. It seems their effects can be permanent but are possible of remedying - and those that lost their health should feel better in the morning. 

We start to investigate the room. [[Costi]] uses his Ghostly Gaze again now that it's clear, and notices a fake wall in the back. Behind it, there's two corpses. Searching the bodies, we don't notice anything special. They are all in the same unremarkable armor, but cut the same and seems to be made intentionally. Is this our [[Army of Undeath]]?? [[Freya]] puts all of their weapons into [[My Hole]].

We push through the false wall, and we see makeshift barracks with some carving instruments and stone tablets. There a 6 humanoid bodies, they have yellowish skin, flat noses, fine armor, and some of the tops of their skulls are missing. They are Githyanki, a race of beings that live in [[The Astral Sea]] that hunt Ilithid. [[Jade]] once saw one in [[Mulfara]]. [[Jade]] looks at the bodies - there's nothing on them except weapons and armor, two of them have their heads ripped open and their skulls are empty. They seem different from the type of wound the intellect devourers made. [[Rhynilex Svenik]] says this sounds like what happens when Illithid feed.

[[Costi]] and [[Hugh]] look around the room, the stone tablets are blank, and it seems like the place has been fully cleaned out. Shelves cleared, empty boxes, but underneath one of the bedrolls is a secret compartment with a hidden circular carved stone tablet. [[Costi]] cast comprehend languages to try and puzzle it out. [[Hugh]] notices one of the Gith seems to have moved. 

We jump into another fight, the Gith are some sort of zombies. We have a chaotic fight, including [[Rez]] using her [[Scales of Chaos]] to blow up them (and herself). We also prevent one of the Gith from going to [[The Astral Sea]] - it seems like they prefer to be buried adrift, but we're not sure if that was their intention or not. 

As we pile up the bodies to burn them, we notice one more secret rock that shows an excavated tunnel leading into the room behind a bookshelf. [[Rhynilex Svenik]] cuts us off and says we must go back to [[Izdeke]] to report. We grab the silver longsword from the plane-shifting Gith and [[Costi]] retries to comprehend language on the [[Githyanki Stone Tablet]] "On the trail of [[G'zraad]], the Ilithid is separate from it's people. Vulnerable. Likelihood of establishing new elderbrain 19%. Path almost complete" 

[[Hugh]] casts Divination and asks [[TrueSilver]], "Would taking down the Ilithid named [[G'zraad]] be beneficial in our goal of curing the anchor tree?", In the flames [[Hugh]] sees a line of brown begin to take shape, brown craggy fire, as it connects to the ground - at the base a black flame emerge. It expands across the rough brown flame. Standing over top of it, there's a flickering purple shape, arms out-stretched. As it's arms raise the black gets larger. Then it all returns to the usual shape. 

We decide to head on the safe route back. About 3 hours into our journey, [[Hugh]] notices a flash of shadow, appearing to be a halfling, [[Nekto Brahnsen]] descending from the corner of the cave as a form leaps out and latches onto [[Rhynilex Svenik]], jamming two darts into her neck on either side. 

As they take her down, they say "we're here to rescue you!"

An older human man in shining gold armor, [[Rieltar]], a orc women in similar gold armor [[Durembur]], and in the back a large human woman with a huge bow across her back, [[Skiv]]. 

We panic chat with them saying we're working with the drow, there's general confusion but then they quickly agree they messed up and are also here to save the anchor tree. We warn them about how [[Rhynilex Svenik]] will feel, but they decide to lie in the bed they made and wake her up. She gets a few good stabs in, and we all prepare for a convoluted introductory conversation.
