# Session 169

[[Freya]] spends some time in the [[Equinox Citadel]], seems like vibes are overall pretty good. 

Back all together at the [[The Solarian Respite]], we spend a while trying to create nicknames for each other. It doesn't go well. [[Adrienne Spout]] refuses "Addie", [[Freya]] volunteers "Weird Purple", for herself. We decide it might take some time. 

We get dressed up for our big night out, after a brief toy argument about which room [[Adrienne Spout]] is going to sleep in. 

[[Samson]] picks us up at the hotel, and we learn he'd never heard of racism or poverty. Tough re-acclimation my guy. He takes us to the bar [[Eirian]] owns, [[The Silver Tongue]]. It's a gorgeous, if loud, enormous silver and white estate, with a moat and gondolas, and 8 large spires. 

[[Samson]] talks a bit about both his transition from patrons and female partners. [[Rez]] is both curious and also hyping how great dating someone from [[Rez's Family]] must be. 

[[Eirian]] greets us and gives us the run down of the areas, stages, and bars (in order of [[Metallic Dragons]], according to her: Copper, Brass, Bronze, Gold, then Silver) at [[The Silver Tongue]]. She's going to go force [[Zmaj]] into joining us. [[E]] points out a [[Captain Mulgrace]], head of her guard [[Melnir]], who can help us if we need anything. 

We all go to gamble, except [[Hugh|Finn]], who goes to chill in the Gold Lounge. 3 gold chip 1 brass 1 bronze (180 gp worth). Folks split some - [[Freya]] plays spinny wheel with [[Samson]]. [[Costi]] goes to find [[Hugh|Finn]] in the Gold Lounge. [[Rez]] sendings [[Vask]], "You know, I was thinking... E could REALLY use some help redecorating. If you have time on your way, want to bring some copper paint? :)" He replies, "Sure! I’ll ask [[Pik]] [[Pak]] to go."

[[Eirian]] comes back with [[Zmaj]] and [[Zalvaris]]. [[Vask]] tries to hit all of us with copper paint filled balloons but only lands on [[Adrienne Spout]] and [[Freya]]. All of [[Rez's Family]] is too prepared. 

We go to see hambone. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it is technically proficient, according to [[Adrienne Spout]]. [[Costi]] [[Rez]] and [[Vask]] thoroughly enjoy it. They also turn a full 86 items from silver, or other metallics, to copper. 

[[Rez]] also notices that no one is leaving this casino destitute, it seems [[E]] is balancing things out one way or another. [[Adrienne Spout]] talks about gambling as a whole with [[Samson]]. She explains interest, lending, and gambling to him. He offers to talk about this to the [[Thelran Asari Council]], he meets with them weekly, did she know? 

We watch a prop comedian who is fine, [[Hambone]]. 

After dancing and drinking in the copper bar, we head to a back pool. Swimsuits optional. Vibes are vibing. [[Adrienne Spout]] is uncomfortable, [[Rez]] leans in, she seems resistant but [[Costi]] decides the night is too boring and changes that. [[Hugh|Finn]] isn't having fun, so we decide to play a game of chicken. [[Freya]] on [[Zalvaris]], [[Rez]] on [[Adrienne Spout]], and in a twist, [[Costi]] on [[Vask]]. Cheating abounds. [[Rez]] is covered in baby oil. [[Vask]] shoots [[Zalv]] in the back [[Costi]] turns into an octopus. Surprising no one, [[Freya]] and [[Zalv]] win. 

[[Eirian]] does a show at a later part of the night, playing the dulcimer and flute, and singing in a haunting voice as well. It's an unbelievable show. 

After, [[Zalv]] and [[Freya]] get one gondola. [[Rez]] convinces [[Adrienne Spout]] to join her on one as well. They talk a bit about [[Rez's Family]] history. [[Zalv]] feeds [[Freya]] cheese. They have a sweet moment remembering [[Zoheret]]'s favorite song. 

Meanwhile, [[Costi]], [[Vask]], [[Hugh|Finn]], and [[Eirian]] go dancing. [[E]] tries to offer anything else to improve [[Hugh|Finn]]'s enjoyment - he shares it's just hard to be in [[Thelran Asari]]. 

[[Rez]] tries to tee up romantic vibes, and/or a conversation, and it starts just as smooching. [[Adrienne Spout]] breaks away mid-way through the ride, incoherently bouncing between lamenting her draw to [[Rez]], trying to tell her they need to make their friendship and work life priority, [[Rez]] does not pick up on either the more or less than [[Adrienne Spout]] is meaning to say - but she sure gets the surface. [[Adrienne Spout]] theorizes this must be different for [[Rez]], given the lives she's lived. [[Rez]] assumes that must be true but doesn't really know why or how. But she comes up with a solution! Every few weeks they'll confirm they're still friends, problem solved, right? Solved enough, apparently. They go make use of the empty hotel room. 

Most of [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] ends back at the [[The Solarian Respite]], [[Freya]] stayed at the [[The Silver Tongue]].
