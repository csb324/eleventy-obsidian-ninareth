-   Start on the road out of the city     
-   2 horses leading, 1 riding beside (for riding)
-   Rez has sessionitis    
-   Jade quizzes Giary in a getting to know you sort of way
	-   Jade thinks we are rich
	-   Giary lied to us about not knowing where Niko was
	-   Costi unties his shoes and tries to trip [[Giary]] - and succeeds!
	-   Things on Jade’s “Giary” card

	-   There is tunnels
	-   Adrienne’s body is a secret but I know why now. Because of the boss
-   Jade “knows” things about Julian 
-   Jade asks if we are really sad about her. He was working with her and there were explodings that we are all involved in. fake art… explodings…have to get in the city 
-   Asked if we killed Adrienne. Freya told her firmly that we did not (that she will get very hurt if she asks that again)
	-   Midnight ships…. Redscale cabal (her word for it). Julian goes to this school and he has buildings. This is fact. There are more people at the school who leave and do things. “Cabal” comprised of
	-   Clifford
	-   Julian

-   There is a compass that pings divination in the front of the carriage
    
-   Doors at the back have abjuration 
    
-   Bottom of the carriage have rocks that have evocation --- dun dun dun sending stones
    

-   Costi ran into the forrest
    

-   It was a ruse to tell us that we can’t talk about anything real 
    
-   Costi could have just written the message on paper, but Tim is dumb
    
-   We got back and Giary asked why we ran and Hugh said he was pooping. Freya helped and rolled a 16 on deception 
    
-   Jade just starts spouting bullshit about the moon to Giary 
    
-   Samuel goes to check and see if the moon is 400 ft away and the size of the carriage
    

-   Travel is quiet for 4 days. We think we see something ahead at one point where there are hills but we avoid complications. We are more in a plains area now. Can see very far which helps avoid complications
    

-   Meet no issues on the road
    
-   See a large cluster of people ahead and pull off for a while when we hear noises of violence. No one dead
    
-   Things we do over the course of 4 days
    

-   Freya reads her book and uses leaves to mark places where she has thoughts or is confused. (Meg rolled a 12 on an INT check which means no help from Joe on the markings in the books) 
    
-   Freya also sends to Rawley
    

-   Hi friend. I’m freya in your brain. Love the book, hard to read. Who is Elaina. Marked in book. Also staff of tongues?
    
-   Rawley - Well it’s good to hear you’re reading. Keep brain sharp on the road. Been a long time since I took a look at the book. Hazy on the details. You’ll figure it out
    

-   Freya gives Jade some background on her life (all the basic things that the party knows). I tell her about A-M-U-B-T-A-H
		- Clara in 2024 says: *shut the fuck up, it was right here.* 
    
-   Costi trains on his dagger. 
    
-   Costi sendings to his mom
    

-   (Tim texted it to Joe)
    

-   Hugh looks for cool things. Freya and Hugh find a fox in holes. We barter with the foxes. 
    

-   We get 37 gold pieces, a glass eye, 6 various door items (knobs, knockers, etc), a small wooden box full of rusty screws, and a small green rock (low quality emerald worth 50 gold pieces)
    
-   They want colorful pieces of glass, nuts, and a lock of Freya’s hair. (We asked them to keep  the hair to be a secret”)
    

-   End of Day 4
    

-   Samuel lifts off and flies away. He starts eating. There is a trail of biscuits in a line and Samuel keeps eating them. Biscuit is rough and irregular. Looks like it was made over a fire
    
-   Biscuit trail ends under a box being held up by a big stick. There is a big, dumb humanoid with a rope connected to the box excited to catch something in his trap.
    
-   We think we are in the clear then I hear “I told you you were no longer invisible” as it throws a rock at us
    
-   Fight 2 giants (one of them does magic and can blink
    

-   Things Jade did in the fight
    

-   Her DEX is 12
    
-   She has banish, while casting magic her glasses are black
    
-   She cursed one of them. When it died (not by her hand), she got health back
    
-   2 Eldritch blasts - appear as snakes that burrow under the ground and then popped out at their feet 
    

-   After the fight, Costi finds a box of rotting sheep corpses.
    
-   Freya doesn’t find any things in their pockets. She does find a green vine embedded in its pec. Pull out a tendril of vine about 9 inches long. 
-   Costi does detect magic and it seems like it’s from the feywild
-   “Wiggle if you are alive” he asks in Sylvan (nat 20 on persuasion) - it wiggles meaning it is alive
-   Freya keeps it
-   We take 10 vials of giant blood (and Costi sucks on a giant toe - jk)
-   We put them under their box trap 
-   We end the session with Giary letting us know we are close to the Ruins of Ruins of Fort Chyvensti where Ulia is rumored to be. We short rest and Rez gives us a song of rest.
