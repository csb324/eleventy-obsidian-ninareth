# Detailed Notes: Session 129

We leave the Black Room. [[The Curator]] is frantically pinging Freya, so Freya sendings to her to ask what's going on. She response, "Freya, I don't know what's happened in your life for the last hour and 15 minutes. Please speak it aloud."

Costi has sending conversation with Tricia.

Tricia: "What happened in the blacksite? As much detail as possible in twenty five words, please."
Costi: "Used replica of Finn finger to enter. Fought, killed 2 warforged guards, 3 constructs, 3 zombies (one big). Cut 37, 47, 222, 135, 136, 137."
Tricia: "Understood. Stay where you are, in twenty minutes youâ€™ll feel a slight pressure on your mind. Let it through, sending experts. Do what they say."
Costi: "Should we go back and destroy further evidence of our presence?"
Tricia: "I recommend you stay exactly where you are and do exactly what the experts say."

Two people walk out of a tree towards us. First is a stocky dwarf ([[Clarence the Cleaner]]), thin white beard, gold braids, ill-fitting armor. Second is a woodelf ([[Molly]] in  Gaiathoren armor. Clarence charges 1100g. We explain the details. They chat:

Clarence: "We could probably [[Gauthoc]]?"
Molly: "We've been cultivating that for so long. Will he do it?"
Clarence: "He will for what we pay him! For the collar, [[Jathya]]? She's got that card game..." They chat out of earshot. Clarence comes back and assures us that he has it handled. We sleep.

During Finn's watch, Molly used a scroll in the middle of the night. Gate opened. 4 bound and unconscious blue Draconics got brought in on a disk being pulled by a fifth blue draconic (Gauthoc). Seemed beat up. Clarence gave Gauth ~325 gold. 10 minutes after Gauth arrival, Molly used 2nd scroll. 2 bound and blindfolded Arkhosians brought in by 3rd Arkhosian (Jathya). [[Jed Nantos]] -- younger man, fit, brown hair and slightly older than Costi looks familiar to Finn. Up-and-comer in Listeners and friend of [[Henrik]] that Costi has played cards with. Green and blue dragonborn (Zukrad). "Their families will be compensated." 350g to Jathya. Clarence gave Jathya and Gauth rooms on one of his 4 ships. They're in the [[Copper Cove]]. We got his card(s). We're supposed to rip it in half, and it lets us send him a message. He offered us items, and we got everything at 5% above cost but were warned future costs would be higher. We buy a fuck ton of potions.

Freya confronted the Curator via dream about being told she could do it on her own. The Curator dissembled. Curator gave Freya a 3 charge boon. A charge lets her reroll a d20 roll after she knows the result or add 5 to a roll. Freya sends a prank to Jade through the Curator. Want huge meaningless book, gets "Find the Humebroxies 7th Edition"

Curator also talks to Adrienne and breaks up with her. Well, Adrienne agrees to be broken up with.

Freya, Cost, and Finn argue about what just happened.
