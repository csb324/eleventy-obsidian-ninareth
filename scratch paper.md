 **Arkhosia:**

Arkhosia is, for all intents and purposes, the most democratic nation in Ninarith. It is ruled by a group of five individuals called The Circle. Those that sit in The Circle are chosen by popular vote. The people of Arkhosia vote for a party, and representation on The Circle is distributed proportionately based on the results of that vote. Each party chooses a number of delegates through an internal vote; there are generally between 70-150 delegates in a party at any given time. The Circle is made up of appointed delegates chosen by party leadership. The Circle is almost always divided in a 3-2 split; in the rare occasions it's broken 4-1 a civil war almost invariably breaks out.

  

Currently, there are two major parties in Arkhosia, the Guardians (more conservative) and the Providers (more liberal). For the last century or so, the Guardians have had a clear stranglehold over politics and the majority on The Circle.

  

The Guardians stand for the status quo. Arkhosia is a very successful nation, and they see little need for things to change. They've quashed attempts at reform, strengthened the power of the landed aristocracy, and worked to keep the franchise from expanding. Dragonborn make up the majority of the aristocracy in Arkhosia, and dominate the Guardian party.

  

The Providers are the loyal opposition party. Their message involves bringing more people into the political system, loosening restrictions on voting rights, and exploring land reform projects.

  

The greatest political issues in 3451 Arkhosia are: voting rights, land ownership reform, and war. Under current law, only individuals owning at least 800 acres of land are able to vote. Alternatively, anyone who owns any land at all who is able to pay a 2,000 gold tax is able to qualify for the vote. Liberal elements in Arkhosia are committed to reforming this practice to lower both the tax and the land burden. Adrianne, Julien payed your tax, you are able to vote. Do with that what you will. The voter rolls are private, but anyone who knows how to bribe can access them easily.

  

There is a significant movement to redistribute land. The Provider's most popular policy plank, among non-voters at least, is a plan to establish a cap on acreage and put land in the lands of workers across Arkhosia. As you might expect, this is stridently opposed by the Guardian party and even some more conservative Providers.

  

Arkhosia is currently technically at peace, but involved in a cold war with Eberron and a proxy war between Mulfara and the College (supporting the College). The parties are unified in their support for continuing this peace, but extremists in The Guardians wish to inflame the war against Eberron and extremists in the Providers are speaking about withdrawing support from the College and joining Mulfara openly.

  

Lastly, there are a number of other parties that either do not attract enough votes to qualify for a seat at The Circle or are not recognized by the state. They have no real power in Arkhosia. These include:

The Kingmakers: They would like to establish a monarchy in Arkhosia, built around Circler Faedwan Drumsbea. She has publicly disavowed them. There are a few public members of this party, and they receive a few votes every election.

The Insurgency: A radical, violent party. They believe in a total dissolution of The Circle and an establishment of a wider Parliament. Their pamphlets discuss a willingness to engage in serious acts of violence, including assassination, to achieve their ends. Some believe the party is simply a Guardian rumor, as no public member of The Insurgency has ever been detained.

The Dairymen: Essentially a trade group, made up of the nation's largest yak farmers. They are entirely focused on the betterment of the dairy industry in Arkhosia. As this is the primary industry, they are rather popular and powerful. They also receive some votes every election, but ever enough to secure a seat.

The Dovetails: A radical pacifist movement, they oppose all foreign war and violence. They are extremely unpopular in Arkhosia.

The Hawktails: Another radical pacifist movement and an offshoot of the Dovetails, they oppose foreign war and are willing to use violence to achieve peace. Even more unpopular, and one of the few groups to which membership is criminal.

I reserve the right to add more, and if you have a few to throw in that Adrianne knows about go crazy

  

Arkhosia relies heavily on yak production to drive their economy. Most clothing is made from yak fur, most meat is yak, and most cheese and dairy is yak milk. They ship it all over the world.
